Although the two abstraction-based learners are different, they share many features (many techniques used in rule-based learning have been adapted from decision tree learning CITATION)1 ,,
We will employ the same CPS definition used in the previous study (the one proposed by CITATION),,
For more information on our tasks and features, see (CITATION; CITATION; CITATION),,
The difference between the two implementations of typicality is that CITATION defines the distance as the Euclidian distance while Daelemans et al,,
According to CITATION hard concepts are often characterized by small typicality spread,,
(1999) which is similar to the definition from CITATION,,

They were all designed as methods for potentially improving the dialog manager of a SDS system called TOOT CITATION,,
