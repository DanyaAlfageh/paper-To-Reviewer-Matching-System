However, such constructions prove to be difficult for stochastic parsers CITATION and they either avoid tackling the problem (CITATION; CITATION) or only deal with a subset of the problematic cases CITATION,,
controlled NP-traces (NPNP), we follow the standard technique of marking nodes dominating the empty element up to but not including the parent of the antecedent as defective (missing an argument) with a gap feature (CITATION; CITATION).1 Furthermore, to make antecedent co-indexation possible with many types of EEs, we generalize Collins approach by enriching the annotation of non-terminals with the type of the EE in question (eg,,
k et al., 2002) or LFG CITATION,,
CITATION proposes an algorithm that is able to find long-distance dependencies, as a postprocessing step, after parsing,,
The idea of threading EEs to their antecedents in a stochastic parser was proposed by CITATION, following the GPSG tradition CITATION,,
For example, supertagging CITATION also aims to do more meaningful syntactic pre-processing,,
