 The other main difference is the apparently nonlocal nature of the problem, which motivates our choice of a Maximum Entropy (ME) model for the tagging task CITATION,,
 We used the Wall Street Journal (WSJ) part of the Penn Treebank CITATION, where extraction is represented by co-indexing an empty terminal element (henceforth EE) to its antecedent,,
 Following the annotation guidelines CITATION, we distinguish seven basic types of EEs: controlled NP-traces (NP), PROs (PRO), traces of A -movement (mostly wh-movement: WH), empty complementizers (COMP), empty units (UNIT), and traces representing pseudo-attachments (shared constituents, discontinuous dependencies, etc,,

 First, we extend the mechanism of adding gap variables for nodes dominating a site of discontinuity CITATION,,
 Furthermore, to ease straightforward comparison with previous work CITATION, a new label CLAUSE is introduced for COMP-SBAR whenever it is followed by a moved clause WHS,,

 In this section, we validate the two-step approach, by applying the parser to the output of the trace tagger, and comparing the antecedent recovery accuracy to CITATION,,

 Comparing our results to CITATION, we find that the NOINSERT model outperforms that of Johnson by 4,,
