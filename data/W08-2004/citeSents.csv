 1 Introduction Recently, a lot of valuable work on the recognition of textual entailment (RTE) has been carried out (Bar CITATION),,
 Several models, ranging from the simple lexical similarity between T and H to advanced Logic Form Representations, have been proposed (CITATION; CITATION; de Salvo CITATION; CITATION),,

 25 \x0cFor this purpose, kernel methods, and in particular tree kernels allow for representing trees in terms of all possible subtrees CITATION,,
 In (Zanzotto and CITATION), this has been addressed by introducing semantic links (placeholders) between text and hypothesis parse trees and evaluating two distinct tree kernels for the trees of texts and for those of hypotheses,,
 In contrast, tree kernels CITATION can be used to efficiently generate the huge space of tree fragments but, to generate the space of pairs of tree fragments, a new kernel function has to be defined,,
