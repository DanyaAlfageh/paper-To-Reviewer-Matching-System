In our previous work CITATION, we started an initial investigation on conversation entailment,,
These features include whether the two strings are the same, two terms have the same stem, the similarity between the two terms either based on WordNet or distributional statistics CITATION,,
 is a large body of work on textual entailment initiated by the Pascal Recognizing Textual Entailment (RTE) Challenges (CITATION; CITATION; CITATION; CITATION; CITATION),,
As more and more conversation data becomes available, researchers have investigated automated processing of conversation data to acquire useful information, for example, related to opinions (CITATION; CITATION; CITATION), biographic attributes CITATION,,,
To focus our effort, currently we only apply annotated dialogue acts provided in the Switchboard corpus CITATION,,
ning approaches have also been applied to measure the similarities between training and testing pairs CITATION,,
 related to opinions (CITATION; CITATION; CITATION), biographic attributes CITATION, social networks CITATION, and agreements and disagreements between participants CITATION,,
This alignment is obtained by following the same set of rules learned from the development dataset as in CITATION,,
To learn the alignment model for nouns, we annotated the noun alignments for the development data used in PASCAL RTE-3 Challenge CITATION and trained a logistic regression model based on the features in Table 1,,
To address this limitation, our previous work CITATION has initiated an investigation on the problem of conversation entailment,,
3 Overall Framework In our previous work CITATION, conversation entailment is formulated as the following: given a conversation segment D which is represented by a set of clauses D = d1 ,,
It is largely used in other NLP tasks such as semantic role labeling CITATION,,
Figure 1(a) shows an example of dependency structures for several utterances that are derived from the Stanford parser CITATION, and Figure 1(b) shows the corresponding clause representation,,
Supervised learning approaches have also been applied to measure the similarities between training and testing pairs CITATION,,
A stops B from doing something; A disagreees with B on something, 8% and 12%) Note that in our original work CITATION, only development data were used to show some initial observations,,
Using the implicit modeling of argument consistency, we follow the same approach as in our previous work CITATION and trained a logistic regression model to predict verb alignment based on the features in Table 1,,
1 Introduction Textual entailment has received increasing attention in recent years (CITATION; CITATION; CITATION; CITATION; CITATION),,

As more and more conversation data becomes available, researchers have investigated automated processing of conversation data to acquire useful information, for example, related to opinions (CITATION; CITATION; CITATION), biographic attributes CITATION, social networks CITATION, and agreements and disagreements between participants CITATION,,
Different approaches have been developed, for example, based on logic proving (CITATION; CITATION; CITATION) and graph match (CITATION; de Salvo CITATION; MacCartney et al., 2006),,
In the most recent RTE Challenge CITATION, the best system achieves 73.5% of accuracy, whi,,

Recent studies have also developed approaches to summarize conversations CITATION and to model conversation structures (dialogue acts) from online Twitter conversations CITATION,,
