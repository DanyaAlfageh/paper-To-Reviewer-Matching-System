3 Overall Framework In our previous work CITATION, conversation entailment is formulated as the following: given a conversation segment D which is represented by a set of clauses D = d1 ,,
Using the implicit modeling of argument consistency, we follow the same approach as in our previous work CITATION and trained a logistic regression model to predict verb alignment based on the features in Table 1,,
This alignment is obtained by following the same set of rules learned from the development dataset as in CITATION,,
A stops B from doing something; A disagreees with B on something, 8% and 12%) Note that in our original work CITATION, only development data were used to show some initial observations,,
