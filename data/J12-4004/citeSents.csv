Introduction Statistical machine translation (MT) uses large target language models (LMs) to improve the fluency of generated texts, and it is commonly assumed that for constructing language models, more data is better data CITATION,,

818 \x0cLembersky, Ordan, and Wintner Language Models for Machine Translation 5.2 Human Evaluation To further establish the qualitative difference between translations produced with an English-original language model and translations produced with a LM created from French-translated-to-English texts, we conducted a human evaluation campaign, using Amazons Mechanical Turk as an inexpensive, reliable, and accessible pool of annotators CITATION,,

This gives rise to yet another hypothesis, namely, that translations from typologically related languages form a similar translationese dialect, whereas translations from more distant source languages form two different dialects in the target language (see CITATION),,

It is important to emphasize that translated texts abound: in fact, CITATION show (quantitatively!) that the rate of translations into a language is inversely proportional to the number of books published in that language: So whereas in English only around 2% of texts published are translations, in languages such as Albanian, Arabic, Danish, Finnish, or Hebrew translated texts constitute between 20% and 25% of the total publications,,
