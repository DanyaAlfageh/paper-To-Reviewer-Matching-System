 1 Introduction Open Relation Extraction (ORE) (Banko and CITATION) has become prevalent over traditional relation extraction methods, especially on the Web, because of the intrinsic difficulty in training individual extractors for every single relation,,
 Shallow methods annotate the sentences with part-of-speech (POS) tags and the ORE approaches in this category, such as ReVerb CITATION and SONEX (Merhav et al,,
 shallow methods, claiming deep NLP costs orders of magnitude more and provide much less dramatic gains in terms of effectiveness CITATION,,
 The counterpoint, illustrated with a recent analysis on a industrial-scale Web crawl CITATION, is that the diversity with which information is encoded in text is too high,,
 TextRunner (Banko and CITATION) and its successor ReVerb CITATION are based on the idea that most relations are expressed using few syntactic patterns,,
 PATTY CITATION extracts textual patterns from sentences based on paths in the dependency graph,,
 SONEX, OLLIE, PATTY, TreeKernel, SwiRL, Lund and our two variants of our method, EXEMPLAR, explained in detail in Appendix A: (1) EXEMPLAR[S] uses the Stanford parser CITATION and (2) EXEMPLAR[M] uses the Malt parser CITATION,,
 WEB-500 is a commonly used dataset, developed for the TextRunner experiments (Banko and CITATION),,
 NYT-500 represents the other end of the spectrum with formal, well written new stories from the New York Times Corpus CITATION,,
 PENN-100 contains sentences from the Penn Treebank recently used in an evaluation of the TreeKernel method CITATION,,
 We manually annotated the relations for WEB-500 and NYT500 and use the PENN-100 annotations provided by TreeKernels authors CITATION,,
 Banko and Etzioni claim that more than 90% of binary relations are expressed through a few syntactic patterns, such as verb and noun+preposition (Banko and CITATION),,
 This section presents a study focusing on how nary relations (n &gt; 2) are expressed in English, based on 100 distinct relations manually annotated from a random sample of 514 sentences in the New York Times Corpus CITATION,,
 syntactic roles correspond to the same semantic role across different relations CITATION,,
2 Preprocessing Given a document, EXEMPLAR extracts its syntactic structure by applying a pipeline of NLP tools provided by the Stanford Parser CITATION,,
 One side of the argument favors shallow methods, claiming deep NLP costs orders of magnitude more and provide much less dramatic gains in terms of effectiveness CITATION,,
 The counterpoint, illustrated with a recent analysis on a industrial-scale Web crawl CITATION, is that the diversity with which information is encoded in text is too high,,
 TextRunner (Banko and CITATION) and its successor ReVerb CITATION are based on the idea that most relations are expressed using few syntactic patterns,,
 The TreeKernel CITATION method uses a dependency tree kernel to classify whether candidate tree paths are indeed instances of relations,,
 Recently, a method based on SRL, called SRL-IE, has shown that the effectiveness of ORE methods can be improved with semantic features CITATION,,
 We implemented our version of SRL-IE by relying on the output of two SRL systems: Lund CITATION and SwiRL CITATION,,
 It does so by first trying to link all entities to Wikipedia (and consequently to Freebase, since Freebase is linked to Wikipedia) by using the method proposed by CITATION,,

 Shallow methods annotate the sentences with part-of-speech (POS) tags and the ORE approaches in this category, such as ReVerb CITATION and SONEX (Merhav et al,,
 Dependency parsing gives unambiguous relations among each word in the sentence, and the ORE approaches in this category such as PATTY CITATION, OLLIE CITATION, and TreeKernel CITATION identify whole subtrees connecting the relation predicate and its arguments,,
 Finally, semantic annotators, such as Lund CITATION and SwiRL CITATION, add roles to each node in a parse tree, enabling ORE approaches that identify the precise connection bet,,
