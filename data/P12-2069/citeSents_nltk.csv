The idea to use an IE system for summarization can be traced back to the FRUMP system CITATION, which generates brief summaries about various kinds of stories; CITATION also wrote abstractive summaries using the output of an IE system applied to events such as natural disasters.,,
A lot of other work has instead used IE to improve the performance of extraction-based systems, like CITATION and CITATION.,,
An experiment CITATION found a performance ceiling to pure sentence extraction that is very low compared to regular (abstractive) human summaries, but not that much better than the current best automatic systems.,,
Abstractive summarization has been explored to some extent in recent years: sentence compression CITATION CITATION, sentence fusion CITATION or revision CITATION, and a generationbased approach that could be called sentence splitting CITATION.,,

Three resources have helped us in designing extraction rules: a thesaurus to find semantically related nouns and verbs; VerbNet CITATION, which provides amongst other things the semantic roles of the syntactical dependents of verbs; and a hand-crafted list of aspect-relevant word stems provided by the team that made CLASSY CITATION.,,
It includes: cleaning up and normalization of the input using regular expressions, sentence segmentation, tokenization and lemmatization using GATE CITATION, syntactical parsing and dependency parsing (collapsed) using the Stanford Parser (de Marneffe et al., 2006), and Named Entity Recognition using Stanford NER CITATION.,,

They are implemented using the SimpleNLG realizer CITATION, which takes a sentence structure and words in their root form as input and gives a sentence with resolved agreements and sentence markers as output.,,

For example, using the most widely used content metric, Pyramid CITATION, the two sentences generated for the cluster D1001AA contain 8 Semantic Content Units (SCU) for a weighted total of 30 out of a maximum of 56, for a raw Pyramid score of 0.54.,,
