 For example, the well-known CITATION parser used a POS-tagger and a finite-state NP chunker as initial stages of a multi-stage Maximum Entropy parser,,
 Recent results making use of finite-state chunkers early in a syntactic parsing pipeline have shown both an efficiency CITATION and an accuracy CITATION benefit to the use of such constraints in a parsing system,,
 CITATION demonstrated an efficiency gain by explicitly disallowing entries in chart cells that would result in constituents that cross chunk boundaries,,
 CITATION demonstrated that high precision constraints on early stages of the Charniak and Johnson (2005) pipelinein the form of base phrase constraints derived either from a chunker or from later stages of an earlier iteration of the c 2008,,
 This second constraint on possible trees can be thought of as a constraint on chart cells, as pointed out in CITATION: no multi-word spanning constituent can begin at a word falling within a base-phrase chunk, other than the first word of that chunk,,

 This accuracy improvement is similar to results obtained in CITATION, where base phrase constraints from a finite-state chunker were used to achieve improved parse accuracy,,
