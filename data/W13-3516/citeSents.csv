ted to dependency structures and other syntactic formalisms such as CCG CITATION and LTAG CITATION, thereby creating an even bigger impact through these additional syntactic resources,,
There has already been evidence of models trained on WSJ doing poorly on non-WSJ data on parses (CITATION; CITATION), semantic role labeling (CITATION; CITATION), word sense (CITATION; ?), and named entities,,
nk CITATION guidelines were used to annotate most frequent lemmas in Chinese,,
We used the number and gender predictions generated by CITATION,,
4.4 Named Entities We retrained the Stanford named entity recognizer20 CITATION on the OntoNotes data,,
2.1.1 Syntax This represents the layer of syntactic annotation based on revised guidelines for the Penn Treebank (CITATION; CITATION), the Chinese Treebank CITATION and the Arabic Treebank CITATION,,
The word sense layer was the subject of prediction in two SemEval-2007 tasks, and the coreference layer was the subject of prediction in the SemEval-20102 CITATION, CoNLL-2011 and 2012 shared tasks (CITATION; CITATION),,
Chinese and Arabic parses were generated using the Berkeley parser CITATION,,
The word sense granularity is tailored to achieve very high interannotator agreement as demonstrated by CITATION,,
Previously CITATION performed 17 The number of sentences in this table are a subs,,
eebank to make them synchronize better with each other: one of the outcomes of this effort was that two types of LINKs that represent pragmatic coreference (LINK-PCR) and selectional preferences (LINK-SLC) were added to the original PropBank CITATION,,
Previously CITATION performed 17 The number of sentences in this table are a subset of the ones in the table showing parser performance, since these are the sentences for which at least one predicate has been tagged with its arguments 18 http://www.lsi.upc.es/srlconll/srl-eval.pl 19 The system could not not use the morphology features in CITATION,,
For a more detailed description, the reader is referred to CITATION and the documentation accompanying the v5.04 release,,
4.2 Word Sense We used the IMS12 (It Makes Sense) CITATION word sense tagger,,
This relates to the mis-implementation of the method proposed by CITATION for scoring predicted mentions,,
Recovering traces in text is a hard problem, and the most recently reported numbers in literature for Chinese are around a F-score of 50 (CITATION; CITATION),,
Most English verbs and few nouns were annotated using the revised guidelines for the English PropBank CITATION as part of the OntoNotes effort,,
To gauge the performance improvement between 2011 and 2012 shared tasks, we performed a clean comparison of over the best performing system and an earlier version of this system CITATION on the CoNLL 2011 test set using the CoNLL 2011 train and development set for training,,
ithm (Bjorkelund and Farkas, 2012), and the second is a best-first resolver CITATION,,
The Chinese propositional structure was predicted with the Chinese semantic role labeler described in CITATION, retrained on the OntoNotes v5.0 data,,
A study by CITATION shows that these can be recovered with an F-score of 55 with automatic parses and roughly 65 using gold parses,,
s were annotated using the revised guidelines for the English PropBank CITATION as part of the OntoNotes effort,,
Chinese, in particular, does not have number or gender inflections for nouns, but CITATION look at a way to infer such information,,
ynchronize better with each other: one of the outcomes of this effort was that two types of LINKs that represent pragmatic coreference (LINK-PCR) and selectional preferences (LINK-SLC) were added to the original PropBank CITATION,,
We trained the CITATION coreference system21 which uses a combination of two pair-wise resolvers, the first is an incremental chain-based resolution algorithm (Bjorkelund and Farkas, 2012), and the second is a best-first resolver CITATION,,
amed Entities We retrained the Stanford named entity recognizer20 CITATION on the OntoNotes data,,
The most recent one of these efforts is the OntoNotes corpus CITATION,,
CITATION report the performance on the English subset of an earlier version of OntoNotes,,
4.1 Syntax Predicted parse trees for English were produced using the Charniak parser11 CITATION,,
However, unlike the previous extensions of the Treebank, in addition to using roughly a third of the same WSJ subcorpus, OntoNotes also added several other genres, and covers two other languages Chinese and Arabic: portions of the Chinese Treebank CITATION and the Arabic Treebank CITATION have been used to sample the genre of text that they represent,,
Some enhancements were made to the English PropBank and Treebank to make them synchronize better with each other: one of the outcomes of this effort was that two types of LINKs that represent pragmatic coreference (LINK-PCR) and selectional preferences (LINK-SLC) were added to the original PropBank CITATION,,
2.1.5 Coreference This layer captures general anaphoric coreference that covers entities and events not limited to noun phrases or a limited set of entity types CITATION,,
For example the Proposition Bank CITATION, BBN Name Entity and Pronoun coreference corpus CITATION, the Penn Discourse Treebank CITATION, and many other annotation projects, all annotate the same underlying body of text,,
It was also converted to dependency structures and other syntactic formalisms such as CCG CITATION and LTAG CITATION, thereby creating an even bigger impact through these additional syntactic resources,,
The Arabic propositional structure was predicted using the system described in CITATION,,
A part of speech agnostic Chinese PropBank CITATION guidelines were used to annotate most frequent lemmas in Chinese,,
We used ASSERT15 CITATION to predict the propositional structure for English,,
Many verbs and some nouns and adjectives were annotated using the revised Arabic PropBank guidelines (CITATION; CITATION),,
9 A study by CITATION shows that one can identify and remove edits from transcribed conversational speech with an F-score of about 78, with roughly 95 precision and 67 recall,,
The current system has a CoNLL score of 60.09 (64.92+69.84+45.51 3 )23 as opposed to the 54.53 reported in bjorkelund CITATION, and the 57.79 reported for the best performing system of CoNLL-2011,,
