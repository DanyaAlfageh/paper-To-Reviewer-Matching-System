Several recent real-world parsers have improved state-of-the-art parsing accuracy by relying on probabilistic or weighted versions of bilexical grammars (CITATION; CITATION; CITATION; CITATION),,
This means that for each string w, there is a lineartime 1-to-1 mapping between (appropriately de~CITATION describes HAs as accepting (or equivalently, generating) zl and z~ from the outside in,,
We note that this construction can be straightforwardly extended to convert stochastic HAGs as in CITATION into stochastic CFGs,,
8 Split head automaton grammars in time O(n 3) For many bilexical CFGs or HAGs of practical significance, just as for the bilexical version of link grammars CITATION, it is possible to parse length-n inputs even faster, in time O(n 3) CITATION,,
For a common special case that was known to allow O(n3) parsing CITATION, we present an O(n 3) algorithm with an improved grammar constant,,
Early mechanisms of this sort included categorial grammar CITATION and subcategorization frames CITATION,,

CITATION actually defined (g-split) bilexical grammars in terms of the latter property,,
For the usual case, split head automaton grammars or equivalent bilexical CFGs, we replace the O(n3) algorithm of CITATION by one with a smaller grammar constant,,
three models in CITATION are susceptible to the O(n 3) method (cf,,
