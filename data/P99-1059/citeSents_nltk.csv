For the usual case, split head automaton grammars or equivalent bilexical CFGs, we replace the O(n3) algorithm of CITATION by one with a smaller grammar constant,,
We will specify a nonstochastic version, noting that probabilities or other weights may be attached to the rewrite rules exactly as in stochastic CFG (CITATION; CITATION),,

We note that this construction can be straightforwardly extended to convert stochastic HAGs as in CITATION into stochastic CFGs,,
For a very common special case of these grammars where an O(n 3) algorithm was previously known CITATION, the grammar constant can be reduced without harming the O(n3) property,,
Early mechanisms of this sort included categorial grammar CITATION and subcategorization frames CITATION,,

CITATION actually defined (g-split) bilexical grammars in terms of the latter property,,

Several recent real-world parsers have improved state-of-the-art parsing accuracy by relying on probabilistic or weighted versions of bilexical grammars (CITATION; CITATION; CITATION; CITATION),,
It is necessary to use an agenda data structure CITATION when implementing the declarative algorithm of Figure 2,,
The CKY algorithm (CITATION; CITATION) is time O(n3,,

8 Split head automaton grammars in time O(n 3) For many bilexical CFGs or HAGs of practical significance, just as for the bilexical version of link grammars CITATION, it is possible to parse length-n inputs even faster, in time O(n 3) CITATION,,
