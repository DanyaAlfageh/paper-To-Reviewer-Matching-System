The third scales pairwise words similarities to the sentence level using weighted average where weights are inverse document frequencies idf as suggested by CITATION (VSPairwise),,
Of existing RTE approaches, the closest to ours is by CITATION, who employ a purely logical approach that uses Boxer to convert both the premise and hypothesis into first-order logic and then checks for entailment using a theorem prover,,
4 Task 1: Recognizing Textual Entailment 4.1 Dataset In order to compare directly to the logic-based system of CITATION, we focus on the RTE-1 dataset CITATION, which includes 567 Text-Hypothesis (T-H) pairs in the development set and 800 pairs in the test set,,
For the RTE task, systems were evaluated using both accuracy and confidence-weighted score (cws) as used by CITATION and the RTE1 challenge CITATION,,
CITATION conceptualize textual entailment as tree rewriting of syntactic graphs, where some rewriting rules are distributional inference rules,,
The best performer in 2012s competition was by CITATION, an ensemble system that integrates many techniques including string similarity, n-,,

CITATION; 2013) proposed an approach to RTE that uses MLNs to combine traditional logical representations with distributional information in order to support probabilistic textual inference,,
Semantic Textual Similarity (STS) is the task of judging the similarity of two sentences on a scale from 0 to 5 CITATION,,
This approach can be viewed as a bridge between CITATIONs purely logical approach, which relies purely on hard logical rules and theorem proving, and distributional approaches, which support graded similarity between concepts but have no notion of logical operators or entailment,,
entailment from CITATION, a system that uses only logic,,
CITATION use this framework for RTE, deriving inference costs from WordNet similarity and properties of the syntactic parse,,
CITATION recognize paraphrases using a tree of vectors, a phrase structure tree in which each constituent is associated,,
