1 Introduction Graph-based (CITATION; CITATION; CITATION) and transition-based (CITATION; CITATION) parsing algorithms offer two different approaches to data-driven dependency parsing.,,
The terms graph-based and transition-based were used by CITATION to describe the difference between MSTParser CITATION, which is a graph-based parser with a,,
Beam-search has been successful in many NLP tasks (CITATION; 562 \x0cInputs: training examples (xi, yi) Initialization: set ~ w = 0 Algorithm: // R training iterations; N examples for t = 1..R, i = 1..N: zi = arg maxyGEN(xi) (y) ~ w if zi 6= yi: ~ w = ~ w + (yi) (zi) Outputs: ~ w Figure 1: The perceptron learning algorithm CITATION), and can achieve accuracy that is close to exact inference.,,
During training, the early update strategy of CITATION is used: when the correct state item falls out of the beam at any stage, parsing is stopped immediately, and the model is updated using the current best partial item.,,
Table 1 shows the feature templates from the MSTParser CITATION, which are defined in terms of the context of a word, its parent and its sibling.,,
We use the discriminative perceptron learning algorithm (CITATION; CITATION) to train the values of ~ w. The algorithm is shown in Figure 1.,,
Averaging parameters is a way to reduce overfitting for perceptron training CITATION, and is applied to all our experiments.,,
While the MSTParser uses exact-inference CITATION, we apply beam-search to decoding.,,
This is done by extending the deterministic Covington algorithm for projective dependency parsing CITATION.,,
As with the graph-based parser, we use the discriminative perceptron CITATION to train the transition-based model (see Figure 5).,,
CITATION showed that the MSTParser and MaltParser produce different errors.,,

Before parsing, POS tags are assigned to the input sentence using our reimplementation of the POStagger from CITATION.,,
Like CITATION, we evaluate the parsing accuracy by the precision of lexical heads (the percentage of input words, excluding punctuation, that have been assigned the correct parent) and by the percentage of complete matches, in which all words excluding punctuation have been assigned the correct parent.,,

Following CITATION, we 1 A recent paper, CITATION reported parent-prediction accuracy of 92.0% using a graph-based parser with a different (larger) set of features (Carreras, 2007).,,
By applying separate word cluster information, CITATION improved the accuracy to 93.2%, which is the best known accuracy on the PTB data.,,
Like CITATION, we use gold-standard POS-tags for the input.,,
