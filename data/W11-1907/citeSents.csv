We apply the recursive variant of spectral clustering, recursive 2-way partitioning (R2 partitioner) CITATION,,
Coreference resolution is then performed globally in one step by partitioning the hypergraph into subhypergraphs so that all mentions in one subhypergraph refer to the same entity CITATION,,
While COPA has been developed originally to perform coreference resolution on MUC and ACE data CITATION, the move to the OntoNotes data CITATION required mainly to update the mention detector and the feature set,,

We apply the recursive variant of spectral clustering, recursive 2-way partitioning (R2 partitioner) CITATION,,
All instances derived from the same type have the same weight, but they may get reweighed by the distance feature (see CITATION),,
Some of the features described in CITATION had to be changed to cope with the OntoNotes data,,
While we implemented this information as weak positive features in CITATION, here we apply these features before graph construction as global variables,,

We use the Stanford MaxentTagger CITATION for partof-speech tagging, and the Stanford Named Entity Recognizer CITATION for annotating named entities,,
In order to derive syntactic information, we use the Charniak/Johnson reranking parser CITATION com56 \x0cbined with a constituent-to-dependency conversion Tool (http://nlp.cs.lth.se/software/ treebank_converter),,
We have implemented an in-house mention detector, which makes use of the parsing output, the partof-speech tags, as well as the chunks from the Yamcha Chunker CITATION,,
