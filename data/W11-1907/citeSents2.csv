2 Preprocessing COPA is implemented on top of the BART-toolkit CITATION,,
Documents are transformed into the MMAX2-format CITATION which allows for easy visualization and (linguistic) debugging,,
We have implemented an in-house mention detector, which makes use of the parsing output, the partof-speech tags, as well as the chunks from the Yamcha Chunker CITATION,,
We use the Stanford MaxentTagger CITATION for partof-speech tagging, and the Stanford Named Entity Recognizer CITATION for annotating named entities,,
In order to derive syntactic information, we use the Charniak/Johnson reranking parser CITATION com56 \x0cbined with a constituent-to-dependency conversion Tool (http://nlp.cs.lth.se/software/ treebank_converter),,
