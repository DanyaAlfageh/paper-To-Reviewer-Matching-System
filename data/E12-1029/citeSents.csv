 We decided to focus our efforts on the TIER event extraction model because it recently produced better performance on the MUC-4 data set than prior learning-based event extraction systems CITATION,,
 The rationale is similar as in the supervised setting CITATION; the event sentence classifier is expected to generalize over all event roles to identify event mention contexts, while the role-specific sentence classifiers are expected to learn to identify contexts specific to individual roles,,
