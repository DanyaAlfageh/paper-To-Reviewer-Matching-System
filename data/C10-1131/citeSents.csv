CITATION and Heilman and Smith (2010),,
CITATION used a generalized Tree-edit Distance method to score mappings between dependency parse trees,,
For RTE3, Harmeling CITATION took a similar classification-based approach with transformation sequence features,,
 word overlap measures (e.g., bag of words, n-grams) have a surprising degree of utility (CITATION; Jijkoun and de Rijke, 2005b), but are nevertheless not sufficient for these tasks (Jijkoun and de Rijke, 2005a),,
For RTE2, CITATION experimented with various TED cost functions and found a combination scheme to work the best for RTE,,
CITATION proposed a syntactic cross-pair similarity measure for RTE,,
CITATION described a system using dependency-based paraphrasing 1Different systems are used for comparison because none of these systems reported performance on both ,,
6 Preprocessing In all of our experiments, each input pair of text and hypothesis sentence is preprocessed as following: Sentences were first tokenized by the standard Penn TreeBank tokenization script, and then we used MXPOST tagger CITATION for part-of-speech (POS) tagging,,
In recent years we have seen many work on applying TED based methods for NLPrelated tasks (CITATION; CITATION; Harmeling, 2007; CITATION),,
CITATION developed a dependency-tree based information discrepancy measure,,
The last step in the pipeline is named-entity tagging using Stanford NER Tagger CITATION,,
Tree edits are represented internally as state transitions in a Finite-State Machine (FSM), and our model is parameterized as a Conditional Random Field (CRF) CITATION, which allows us to incorporate a diverse set of arbitrarily overlapping features,,

Another work that also developed an interesting approach to stochastic tree edit distance is CITATION, but unfortunately,,
CITATION described a system using depe,,
We observe a larger gap in recall, suggesting our method tends to give higher precision, which is also commonly found in other syntax-based systems CITATION,,
It is worth noting that CITATION achieved second place in the official RTE2 evaluation,,
t al., 1164 \x0c2007; CITATION),,
More recent studies gained further leverage from systematic exploration of the syntactic feature space through analysis of parse trees (Wang et al., 1164 \x0c2007; CITATION),,

Our work is also closely related to other recent work on learning probabilistic models involving structural latent variables (CITATION; CITATION; CITATION; CITATION),,
CITATION proposed a Quasi-synchronous Grammar formulation of the problem which also models alignment as structured latent variables, but in a generative probabilistic model,,
However, this shortcoming can be addressed partially by extending the model to deal with constrained re-ordering per CITATION,,
We use standard evaluation datasets RTE1-3 from the Pascal RTE Challenges CITATION,,

Alignment-based approach have been proven effective by many RTE, QA and MTE systems (Haghighi et al., 2005; CITATION; CITATION; CITATION, inter alia),,
Traditional approaches employ a two-stage or multi-stage model where tasks are broken down into alignment finding, feature extraction, and feature learning subtasks (Haghighi et al., 2005; CITATION),,
CITATION described a system using dependency-based paraphrasing 1Different systems are used for comparison because none of these systems reported performance on both datasets,,
Earlier studies in these domains have concluded that simple word overlap measures (e.g., bag of words, n-grams) have a surprising degree of utility (CITATION; Jijkoun and de Rijke, 2005b), but are nevertheless not sufficient for these tasks (Jijkoun and de Rijke, 2005a),,
applying TED based methods for NLPrelated tasks (CITATION; CITATION; Harmeling, 2007; CITATION),,
CITATION used syntactic heuristic matching rules with a lexical-similarity back-off model,,
Studies have also shown that certain prominent syntactic features are often found beneficial CITATION,,
10 Related Work Tree Edit Distance (TED) have been studied extensively in theoretical and algorithmic research (CITATION; CITATION; CITATION),,
A promising approach to these challenges is modeling the alignment as an edit operation sequence over parse tree representation, an approach pioneered by (CITATION; CITATION; Harmeling, 2007; CITATION),,
Another work that also developed an interesting approach to stochastic tree edit distance is CITATION, but unfortunately experiments in the paper were limited to digit recognition and tasks on small artificial datasets,,
POS tagged sentences were then parsed by MSTParser CITATION to produce labeled dependency parse trees,,
CITATION, with lexical-semantic augmentation from WordNet,,
constrained re-ordering per CITATION,,
Other studies have successfully applied theorem proving and logical induction techniques, translating both sentences to knowledge representations and then doing inference on these representations (CITATION; Raina et al., 2005; de Salvo CITATION; CITATION, inter alia),,
In order to take advantage of this label information, we adopt an interesting discriminative learning framework first introduced by CITATION,,
CITATION extracted features from dependency path, and combined them with word-alignment features in a mixture of experts classifier,,
CITATION for part-of-speech (POS) tagging,,
The work of CITATION inspired the discriminative training framework that we used in our experiments,,

Alignment-based approach have been proven effective by many RTE, QA and MTE systems (Haghighi et al., 2005; CITATION; CITATION,,
looking for specific SUB/OBJ/PRD construct as in CITATION,,
(2006) and CITATION, but not as sophisticated,,
A line of work that offers similar treatment of alignment to our model is the Quasi-synchronous Grammar (QG) (CITATION; CITATION; CITATION),,
CITATION proposed a Quasi-synchronous Grammar formulation of the proble,,
Many different approaches to modeling sentence alignment have been proposed before (Haghighi et al., 2005; CITATION),,
