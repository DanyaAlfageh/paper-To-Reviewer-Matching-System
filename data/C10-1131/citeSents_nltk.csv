Our work is also closely related to other recent work on learning probabilistic models involving structural latent variables (CITATION; CITATION; CITATION; CITATION),,
CITATION for part-of-speech (POS) tagging,,
More recent studies gained further leverage from systematic exploration of the syntactic feature space through analysis of parse trees (Wang et al., 1164 \x0c2007; CITATION),,
6 Preprocessing In all of our experiments, each input pair of text and hypothesis sentence is preprocessed as following: Sentences were first tokenized by the standard Penn TreeBank tokenization script, and then we used MXPOST tagger CITATION for part-of-speech (POS) tagging,,
applying TED based methods for NLPrelated tasks (CITATION; CITATION; Harmeling, 2007; CITATION),,
Other studies have successfully applied theorem proving and logical induction techniques, translating both sentences to knowledge representations and then doing inference on these representations (CITATION; Raina et al., 2005; de Salvo CITATION; CITATION, inter alia),,
Tree edits are represented internally as state transitions in a Finite-State Machine (FSM), and our model is parameterized as a Conditional Random Field (CRF) CITATION, which allows us to incorporate a diverse set of arbitrarily overlapping features,,
For RTE2, CITATION experimented with various TED cost functions and found a combination scheme to work the best for RTE,,
The work of CITATION inspired the discriminative training framework that we used in our experiments,,
CITATION, with lexical-semantic augmentation from WordNet,,
The last step in the pipeline is named-entity tagging using Stanford NER Tagger CITATION,,
Many different approaches to modeling sentence alignment have been proposed before (Haghighi et al., 2005; CITATION),,
CITATION and Heilman and Smith (2010),,
7; CITATION),,
CITATION developed a dependency-tree based information discrepancy measure,,
Traditional approaches employ a two-stage or multi-stage model where tasks are broken down into alignment finding, feature extraction, and feature learning subtasks (Haghighi et al., 2005; CITATION),,
t al., 1164 \x0c2007; CITATION),,
CITATION proposed a Quasi-synchronous Grammar formulation of the problem which also models alignment as structured latent variables, but in a generative probabilistic model,,
In order to take advantage of this label information, we adopt an interesting discriminative learning framework first introduced by CITATION,,
For RTE3, Harmeling CITATION took a similar classification-based approach with transformation sequence features,,
fic SUB/OBJ/PRD construct as in CITATION,,
In recent years we have seen many work on applying TED based methods for NLPrelated tasks (CITATION; CITATION; Harmeling, 2007; CITATION),,
constrained re-ordering per CITATION,,
CITATION, with no statistically significant difference (p &gt; 5 in sign test),,
It is worth noting that CITATION achieved second place in the official RTE2 evaluation,,
Alignment-based approach have been proven effective by many RTE, QA and MTE systems (Haghighi et al., 2005; CITATION; CITATION; CITATION, inter alia),,
POS tagged sentences were then parsed by MSTParser CITATION to produce labeled dependency parse trees,,
We use standard evaluation datasets RTE1-3 from the Pascal RTE Challenges CITATION,,
Studies have also shown that certain prominent syntactic features are often found beneficial CITATION,,
looking for specific SUB/OBJ/PRD construct as in CITATION,,
CITATION described a system using dependency-based paraphrasing 1Different systems are used for comparison because none of these systems reported performance on both ,,
(2006) and CITATION, but not as sophisticated,,
10 Related Work Tree Edit Distance (TED) have been studied extensively in theoretical and algorithmic research (CITATION; CITATION; CITATION),,
CITATION proposed a syntactic cross-pair similarity measure for RTE,,
 word overlap measures (e.g., bag of words, n-grams) have a surprising degree of utility (CITATION; Jijkoun and de Rijke, 2005b), but are nevertheless not sufficient for these tasks (Jijkoun and de Rijke, 2005a),,
CITATION described a system using depe,,
Another work that also developed an interesting approach to stochastic tree edit distance is CITATION, but unfortunately,,
CITATION used a generalized Tree-edit Distance method to score mappings between dependency parse trees,,
CITATION described a system using dependency-based paraphrasing 1Different systems are used for comparison because none of these systems reported performance on both datasets,,
CITATION proposed a Quasi-synchronous Grammar formulation of the proble,,
Another work that also developed an interesting approach to stochastic tree edit distance is CITATION, but unfortunately experiments in the paper were limited to digit recognition and tasks on small artificial datasets,,

(2006) were reported by CITATION,,
We observe a larger gap in recall, suggesting our method tends to give higher precision, which is also commonly found in other syntax-based systems CITATION,,
Earlier studies in these domains have concluded that simple word overlap measures (e.g., bag of words, n-grams) have a surprising degree of utility (CITATION; Jijkoun and de Rijke, 2005b), but are nevertheless not sufficient for these tasks (Jijkoun and de Rijke, 2005a),,

A promising approach to these challenges is modeling the alignment as an edit operation sequence over parse tree representation, an approach pioneered by (CITATION; CITATION; Harmeling, 2007; CITATION),,
CITATION extracted features from dependency path, and combined them with word-alignment features in a mixture of experts classifier,,
A line of work that offers similar treatment of alignment to our model is the Quasi-synchronous Grammar (QG) (CITATION; CITATION; CITATION),,
However, this shortcoming can be addressed partially by extending the model to deal with constrained re-ordering per CITATION,,
Alignment-based approach have been proven effective by many RTE, QA and MTE systems (Haghighi et al., 2005; CITATION; CITATION,,
