Early deep semantic models (e.g., CITATION) as well as more recent ones (e.g., (CITATION; CITATION; CITATION)) rely on specific world knowledge encoded in rules for drawing decisions,,
Shallower models exploit matching methods between syntactic/semantic graphs of texts and hypotheses CITATION,,
The matching step is carried out after the application of some lexical-syntactic rules that are used to transform the text T or the hypothesis H CITATION at surface form level,,
