 In order to compare the contribution of unambiguous and ambiguous sentences to the estimation results, we extracted a subcorpus of 4,000 sentences, for which the LFG grammar produced a unique parse, from the full train2 The German LFG grammar is being implemented in the Xerox Linguistic Environment (XLE, see CITATION) as part of the Parallel Grammar (ParGram) project at the IMS Stuttgart,,

 Class-based estimated frequencies are introduced in CITATION as the frequency f(v; n) of a (v; n)-pair in the training corpus, weighted by the best estimate of the class-membership probability p(cjv; n) of an EM-based clustering model on (v; n)-pairs, i,,
 As is shown in CITATION in an evaluation on lexical ambiguity resolution, a gain of about 7% can be obtained by using the class-based estimated frequency fc(v; n) as disambiguation criterion instead of classbased probabilities p(njv),,
