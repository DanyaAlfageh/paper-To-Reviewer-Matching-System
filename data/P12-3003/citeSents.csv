 Following the two-stage prediction aggregation methods CITATION, such pre-labeled results, together with other conventional features used by the state-of-the-art NER systems, are fed into a linear CRF models, which conducts fine-grained tweet level NER,,

 To prepare the initial clusters required by the SRL component as its input, we adopt the predicateargument mapping method CITATION to get some automatically labeled tweets, which (plus the manually labeled tweets) are then organized into groups using a bottom-up clustering procedure,,

 It is worth noting that: 1) our SRL component uses the general role schema defined by PropBank, which includes core roles such as A0, A1 (usually indicating the agent and patient of the predicate, respectively), and auxiliary roles such as AM-TMP and AM-LOC (representing the temporal and location information of the predicate, respectively); 2) only verbal predicates are considered, which is consistent with most existing SRL systems; and 3) following CITATION, it conducts word level labeling,,

 However, unlike existing IE systems, such as Evita CITATION, a robust event recognizer for QA system, and SRES CITATION, a self-supervised relation extractor for the web, it targets tweets, a new genre of text, which are short and informal, and its focus is on adapting existing IE components to tweets,,
