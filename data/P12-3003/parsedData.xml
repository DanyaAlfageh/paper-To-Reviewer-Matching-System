Tweets have become a comprehensive repos-
itory for real-time information. However, it
is often hard for users to quickly get informa-
tion they are interested in from tweets, ow-
ing to the sheer volume of tweets as well as
their noisy and informal nature. We present
QuickView, an NLP-based tweet search plat-
form to tackle this issue. Specifically, it ex-
ploits a series of natural language process-
ing technologies, such as tweet normalization,
named entity recognition, semantic role label-
ing, sentiment analysis, tweet classification, to
extract useful information, i.e., named entities,
events, opinions, etc., from a large volume
of tweets. Then, non-noisy tweets, together
with the mined information, are indexed, on
top of which two brand new scenarios are en-
abled, i.e., categorized browsing and advanced
search, allowing users to effectively access
either the tweets or fine-grained information
they are interested in.

<bodyText confidence="0.999546222222222">
Tweets represent a comprehensive fresh informa-
tion repository. However, users often have diffi-
culty finding information they are interested in from
tweets, because of the huge number of tweets as well
as their noisy and informal nature. Tweet search,
e.g., Twitter 1, is a kind of service aiming to tackle
this issue. Nevertheless, existing tweet search ser-
vices provide limited functionality. For example, in
Twitter, only a simple keyword-based search is sup-

ported, and the returned list often contains meaning-
less results.
This demonstration introduces QuickView, which
employs a series of NLP technologies to extract
useful information from a large volume of tweets.
Specifically, for each tweet, it first conducts nor-
malization, followed by named entity recognition
(NER). Then it conducts semantic role labeling
(SRL) to get predicate-argument structures, which
are further converted into events, i.e., triples of who
did what. After that, it performs sentiment analysis
(SA), i.e., extracting positive or negative comments
about something/somebody. Next, tweets are clas-
sified into predefined categories. Finally, non-noisy
tweets together with the mined information are in-
dexed.
On top of the index, QuickView enables two brand
new scenarios, allowing users to effectively access
the tweets or fine-grained information mined from
tweets.
Categorized Browsing. As illustrated in Figure
1(a), QuickView shows recent popular tweets, enti-
ties, events, opinions and so on, which are organized
by categories. It also extracts and classifies URL
links in tweets and allows users to check out popular
links in a categorized way.
Advanced Search. As shown in Figure 1(b), Quick-
View provides four advanced search functions: 1)
search results are clustered so that tweets about the
same/similar topic are grouped together, and for
each cluster only the informative tweets are kept;
2) when the query refers to a person or a company,
two bars are presented followed by the words that
strongly suggest opinion polarity. The bars width
</bodyText>

<bodyText confidence="0.985109369230769">
\x0cis proportional to the number of associated opin-
ions; 3) similarly, the top six most frequent words
that most clearly express event occurrences are pre-
sented; 4) users can search tweets with opinions
or events, e.g., search tweets containing any posi-
tive/negative opinion about Obama or any event
involving Obama.
The implementation of QuickView requires adapt-
ing existing NLP components trained on formal
texts, which often performs poorly on tweets. For
example, the average F1 of the Stanford NER
(Finkel et al., 2005) drops from 90.8% (Ratinov
and Roth, 2009) to 45.8% on tweets, while Liu et
al. (2010) report that the F1 score of a state-of-
the-art SRL system (Meza-Ruiz and Riedel, 2009)
falls to 42.5% on tweets as apposed to 75.5% on
news. However, the adaptation of those components
is challenging, owing to the lack of annotated tweets
and the inadequate signals provided by a noisy and
short tweet. Our general strategy is to leverage ex-
isting resources as well as unsupervised or semi-
supervised learning methods to reduce the labeling
efforts, and to aggregate as much evidence as pos-
sible from a broader context to compensate for the
lack of information in a tweet.
This strategy is embodied by various components
we have developed. For example, our NER com-
ponent combines a k-nearest neighbors (KNN) clas-
sifier, which collects global information across re-
cently labeled tweets with a Conditional Random
Fields (CRF) labeler, which exploits information
from a single tweet and the gazetteers. Both the
KNN classifier and the CRF labeler are repeatedly
retrained using the results that they have confidently
labeled. The SRL component caches and clusters
recent labeled tweets, and aggregates information
from the cluster containing the tweet. Similarly, the
classifier considers not only the current tweet but
also its neighbors in a tweet graph, where two tweets
are connected if they are similar in content or have a
tweet/retweet relationship.
QuickView has been internally deployed, and re-
ceived extremely positive feedback. Experimental
results on a human annotated dataset also indicate
the effectiveness of our adaptation strategy.
Our contributions are summarized as follows.
1. We demonstrate QuickView, an NLP-based
tweet search. Different from existing methods,
it exploits a series of NLP technologies to ex-
tract useful information from a large volume
of tweets, and enables categorized browsing
and advanced search scenarios, allowing users
to efficiently access information they are inter-
ested in from tweets.
2. We present core components of QuickView, fo-
cusing on how to leverage existing resources
and technologies as well as how to make up
for the limited information in a short and often
noisy tweet by aggregating information from a
broader context.
The rest of this paper is organized as follows. In
the next section, we introduce related work. In Sec-
tion 3, we describe our system. In Section 4, we
evaluate our system. Finally, Section 5 concludes
and presents future work.

Information Extraction Systems. Essentially,
QuickView is an information extraction (IE) system.
However, unlike existing IE systems, such as Evita
(Saur et al., 2005), a robust event recognizer for QA
system, and SRES (Rozenfeld and Feldman, 2008),
a self-supervised relation extractor for the web, it
targets tweets, a new genre of text, which are short
and informal, and its focus is on adapting existing IE
components to tweets.
Tweet Search Services. A couple of tweet search
services exist, including Twitter, Bing social search
2 and Google social search 3. Most of them provide
only keyword-based search interfaces, i.e., return-
ing a list of tweets related to a given word/phrase.
In contrast, our system extracts fine-grained in-
formation from tweets and allows a new end-to-
end search experience beyond keyword search, such
as clustering of search results, and search with
events/opinions.
NLP Components. The NLP technologies adopted
in our system , e.g., NER, SRL and classification,
have been extensively studied on formal text but
rarely on tweets. At the heart of our system is
the re-use of existing resources, methodologies as

well as components, and the the adaptation of them
to tweets. The adaptation process, though varying
across components, consists of three common steps:
1) annotating tweets; 2) defining the decision con-
text that usually involves more than one tweet, such
as a cluster of similar tweets; and 3) re-training mod-
els (often incrementally) with both conventional fea-
tures and features derived from the context defined
in step 2.

Architecture. QuickView can be divided into four
parts, as illustrated in Figure 2. The first part in-
cludes a crawler and a buffer of raw tweets. The
crawler repeatedly downloads tweets using the Twit-
ter APIs, and then pre-filters noisy tweets using
some heuristic rules, e.g., removing a tweet if it is
too short, say, less than 3 words, or if it contains
any predefined banned word. At the moment, we
focus on English tweets, so non-English tweets are
filtered as well. Finally, the un-filtered are put into
the buffer.
The second part consists of several tweet extrac-
tion pipelines. Each pipeline has the same configura-
tion, constantly fetching a tweet from the raw tweet
buffer, and conducting the following processes se-

quentially: 1) normalization; 2) parsing including
part-of-speech (POS), chunking, and dependency
parsing; 3) NER; 4) SRL; 5) SA and 6) classifica-
tion. The normalization model identifies and cor-
rects ill-formed words. For example, after normal-
ization, loooove in I loooove my icon
will be transformed to love. A phrase-based trans-
lation system without re-ordering is used to imple-
ment this model. The translation table includes man-
ually compiled ill/good form pairs, and the language
model is a trigram trained on LDC data 4 using
SRILM (Stolcke, 2002). The OpenNLP 5 toolkit
is directly used to implement the parsing model.
In future, the parsing model will be re-trained us-
ing annotated tweets. The SA component is imple-
mented according to Jiang et al. (2011), which incor-
porates target-dependent features and considers re-
lated tweets by utilizing a graph-based optimization.
The classification model is a KNN-based classifier
that caches confidently labeled results to re-train it-
self, which also recognizes and drops noisy tweets.

<bodyText confidence="0.995031918918919">
Each processed tweet, if not identified as noise, is
put into a shared buffer for indexing.
The third part is responsible for indexing and
querying. It constantly takes from the indexing
buffer a processed tweet, which is then indexed with
various entries including words, phrases, metadata
(e.g., source, publish time, and account), named en-
tities, events, and opinions. On top of this, it answers
any search request, and returns a list of matched re-
sults, each of which contains both the original tweet
and the extracted information from that tweet. We
implement an indexing/querying engine similar to
Lucene 6 in C#. This part also maintains a cache of
recent processed tweets, from which the following
information is extracted and indexed: 1) top tweets;
2) top entities/events/opinions in tweets; and 3)
top accounts. Whether a tweet/entity/event/opinion
ranks top depends on their re-tweeted/mentioned
times as well as its publisher, while whether an ac-
count is top relies on the number of his/her followers
and tweets.
The fourth part is a web application that returns
related information to end users according to their
browsing or search request. The implementation of
the web application is organized with the model-
view-control pattern so that other kinds of user in-
terfaces, e.g., a mobile application, can be easily im-
plemented.
Deployment. QuickView is deployed into 5 work-
stations 7 including 2 processing pipelines, as illus-
trated in Table 1. The communication between com-
ponents is through TCP/IP. On average, it takes 0.01
seconds to process each tweet, and in total about
10 million tweets are indexed every day. Note that
QuickViews processing capability can be enhanced
in a straightforward manner by deploying additional
pipelines.

Because of limited space, we only discuss two core
components of QuickView: NER and SRL.
NER. NER is the task of identifying mentions of
rigid designators from text belonging to named-
entity types such as persons, organizations and loca-
tions. Existing solutions fall into three categories: 1)

the rule-based (Krupka and Hausman, 1998); 2) the
machine learning based (Finkel and Manning, 2009;
Singh et al., 2010); and 3) hybrid methods (Jansche
and Abney, 2002). With the availability of annotated
corpora, such as ACE05, Enron and CoNLL03, the
data-driven methods become the dominating meth-
ods. However, because of domain mismatch, cur-
rent systems trained on non-tweets perform poorly
on tweets.
Our NER system takes three steps to address
this problem. Firstly, it defines those recently la-
beled tweets that are similar to the current tweet
as its recognition context, under which a KNN-
based classifier is used to conduct word level clas-
sification. Following the two-stage prediction ag-
gregation methods (Krishnan and Manning, 2006),
such pre-labeled results, together with other con-
ventional features used by the state-of-the-art NER
systems, are fed into a linear CRF models, which
conducts fine-grained tweet level NER. Secondly,
the KNN and CRF model are repeatedly retrained
with an incrementally augmented training set, into
which highly confidently labeled tweets are added.
Finally, following Lev Ratinov and Dan Roth
(2009), 30 gazetteers are used, which cover common
names, countries, locations, temporal expressions,
etc. These gazetteers represent general knowledge
across domains, and help to make up for the lack of
training data.
SRL. Given a sentence, the SRL component identi-
fies every predicate, and for each predicate further
identifies its arguments. This task has been exten-
sively studied on well-written corpora like news, and
a couple of solutions exist. Examples include: 1)
the pipelined approach, i.e., dividing the task into
several successive components such as argument
identification, argument classification, global infer-
ence, etc., and conquering them individually (Xue,
2004; Koomen et al., 2005); 2) sequentially labeling
based approach (Marquez et al., 2005), i.e., label-
ing the words according to their positions relative
to an argument (i.e., inside, outside, or at the be-
ginning); and 3) Markov Logic Networks (MLN)
based approach (Meza-Ruiz and Riedel, 2009),
i.e., simultaneously resolving all the sub-tasks using
learnt weighted formulas. Unsurprisingly, the per-
formance of the state-of-the-art SRL system (Meza-
Ruiz and Riedel, 2009) drops sharply when applied
to tweets.
The SRL component of QuickView is based on
CRF, and uses the recently labeled tweets that are
similar to the current tweet as the broader context.
Algorithm 1 outlines its implementation, where:
train denotes a machine learning process to get a
labeler l, which in our work is a linear CRF model;
the cluster function puts the new tweet into a clus-
ter; the label function generates predicate-argument
structures for the input tweet with the help of the
trained model and the cluster; p, s and cf denote a
predicate, a set of argument and role pairs related to
the predicate and the predicted confidence, respec-
tively. To prepare the initial clusters required by the
SRL component as its input, we adopt the predicate-
argument mapping method (Liu et al., 2010) to
get some automatically labeled tweets, which (plus
the manually labeled tweets) are then organized into
groups using a bottom-up clustering procedure.
It is worth noting that: 1) our SRL component
uses the general role schema defined by PropBank,
which includes core roles such as A0, A1 (usually
indicating the agent and patient of the predicate, re-
spectively), and auxiliary roles such as AM-TMP
and AM-LOC (representing the temporal and loca-
tion information of the predicate, respectively); 2)
only verbal predicates are considered, which is con-
sistent with most existing SRL systems; and 3) fol-
lowing Marquez et al. (2005), it conducts word level
labeling.

<bodyText confidence="0.99977765">
We have described the motivation, scenarios, archi-
tecture, deployment and implementation of Quick-
View, an NLP-based tweet search. At the heart of
QuickView is the adaptation of existing NLP tech-
nologies, e.g., NER, SRL and SA, to tweets, a new
genre of text, which are short and informal. We
have illustrated our strategy to tackle this challeng-
ing task, i.e., leveraging existing resources and ag-
gregating as much information as possible from a
broader context, using NER and SRL as case stud-
ies. Preliminary positive feedback suggests the use-
fulness of QuickView and its advantages over exist-
ing tweet search services. Experimental results on
a human annotated dataset indicate the effectiveness
of our adaptation strategy.
We are improving the quality of the core compo-
nents of QuickView by labeling more tweets and ex-
ploring alternative models. We are also customizing
QuickView for non-English tweets. As it progresses,
we will release QuickView to the public.

For example, after normalization, loooove in I loooove my icon will be transformed to love. A phrase-based translation system without re-ordering is used to implement this model. The translation table includes manually compiled ill/good form pairs, and the language model is a trigram trained on LDC data 4 using SRILM (Stolcke, 2002). The OpenNLP 5 toolkit is directly used to implement the parsing model. In future, the parsing model will be re-trained using annotated tweets. The SA component is implemented according to Jiang et al. (2011), which incorporates target-dependent features and considers related tweets by utilizing a graph-based optimization. The classification model is a KNN-based classifier that caches confidently labeled results to re-train itself, which also recognizes and drops noisy tweets. 4 http://www.ldc.upenn.edu/Catalog/CatalogEntry.jsp ?catalogId=LDC2005T12 5 http://sourceforge.net/projects/opennlp/ Each processed tweet, if not identified as noise, is put into a shared buffer for indexing.

To prepare the initial clusters required by the SRL component as its input, we adopt the predicateargument mapping method (Liu et al., 2010) to get some automatically labeled tweets, which (plus the manually labeled tweets) are then organized into groups using a bottom-up clustering procedure. It is worth noting that: 1) our SRL component uses the general role schema defined by PropBank, which includes core roles such as A0, A1 (usually indicating the agent and patient of the predicate, respectively), and auxiliary roles such as AM-TMP and AM-LOC (representing the temporal and location information of the predicate, respectively); 2) only verbal predicates are considered, which is consistent with most existing SRL systems; and 3) f</context>

At the heart of QuickView is the adaptation of existing NLP technologies, e.g., NER, SRL and SA, to tweets, a new genre of text, which are short and informal.

However, unlike existing IE systems, such as Evita (Saur et al., 2005), a robust event recognizer for QA system, and SRES (Rozenfeld and Feldman, 2008), a self-supervised relation extractor for the web, it targets tweets, a new genre of text, which are short and informal, and its focus is on adapting existing IE components to tweets. Tweet Search Services. A couple of tweet search services exist, including Twitter, Bing social search 2 and Google social search 3. Most of them provide only keyword-based search interfaces, i.e., returning a list of tweets related to a given word/phrase. In contrast, our system extracts fine-grained information from tweets and allo</context>

With the availability of annotated corpora, such as ACE05, Enron and CoNLL03, the data-driven methods become the dominating methods. However, because of domain mismatch, current systems trained on non-tweets perform poorly on tweets. Our NER system takes three steps to address this problem. Firstly, it defines those recently labeled tweets that are similar to the current tweet as its recognition context, under which a KNNbased classifier is used to conduct word level classification.

The normalization model identifies and corrects ill-formed words. For example, after normalization, loooove in I loooove my icon will be transformed to love. A phrase-based translation system without re-ordering is used to implement this model. The translation table includes manually compiled ill/good form pairs, and the language model is a trigram trained on LDC data 4 using SRILM (Stolcke, 2002). The OpenNLP 5 toolkit is directly used to implement the parsing model. In future, the parsing model will be re-trained using annotated tweets. The SA component is implemented according to Jiang et al. (2011), which incorporates target-dependent features and considers related tweets by utilizing a graph-based optimization. The classification model is a KNN-based classifier that caches confidently labeled results to re-train itself, which also recognizes and drops noisy tweets. 4 http://www.ldc.upenn.edu/Catalog/CatalogEntry.jsp ?catalogId=LDC2005T12 5 http://sourceforge.net/projects/opennlp/ </context>

SRL. Given a sentence, the SRL component identifies every predicate, and for each predicate further identifies its arguments. This task has been extensively studied on well-written corpora like news, and a couple of solutions exist. Examples include: 1) the pipelined approach, i.e., dividing the task into several successive components such as argument identification, argument classification, global inference, etc., and conquering them individually (Xue, 2004; Koomen et al., 2005); 2) sequentially labeling based approach (Marquez et al., 2005), i.e., labeling the words according to their positions relative to an argument (i.e., inside, outside, or at the beginning); and 3) Markov Logic Networks (MLN) based approach (Meza-Ruiz and Riedel, 2009), i.e., simultaneously resolving all the sub-tasks using learnt weighted formulas. Unsurprisingly, the performance of the state-of-the-art SRL system (MezaRuiz and Riedel, 2009) drops sharply when applied to tweets. The SRL component of QuickView is based on CRF, and uses the recently labeled tweets that are </context>
