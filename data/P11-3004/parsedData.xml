Named entity disambiguation is the task of
linking an entity mention in a text to the cor-
rect real-world referent predefined in a knowl-
edge base, and is a crucial subtask in many
areas like information retrieval or topic detec-
tion and tracking. Named entity disambigua-
tion is challenging because entity mentions
can be ambiguous and an entity can be refer-
enced by different surface forms. We present
an approach that exploits Wikipedia relations
between entities co-occurring with the am-
biguous form to derive a range of novel fea-
tures for classifying candidate referents. We
find that our features improve disambiguation
results significantly over a strong popularity
baseline, and are especially suitable for recog-
nizing entities not contained in the knowledge
base. Our system achieves state-of-the-art re-
sults on the TAC-KBP 2009 dataset.

1 Introduction

<bodyText confidence="0.999372872340426">
Identifying the correct real-world referents of named
entities (NE) mentioned in text (such as people, or-
ganizations, and geographic locations) plays an im-
portant role in various natural language processing
and information retrieval tasks. The goal of Named
Entity Disambiguation (NED) is to label a surface
form denoting an NE in text with one of multiple
predefined NEs from a knowledge base (KB), or
to detect that the surface form refers to an out-of-
KB entity, which is known as NIL detection. NED
has become a popular research field recently, as
the growth of large-scale publicly available encyclo-
pedic knowledge resources such as Wikipedia has
stimulated research on linking NEs in text to their
entries in these KBs (Bunescu and Pasca, 2006; Mc-
Namee and Dang, 2009).
The disambiguation of named entities raises sev-
eral challenges: Surface forms in text can be am-
biguous, and the same entity can be referred to by
different surface forms. For example, the surface
form George Bush may denote either of two for-
mer U.S. presidents, and the later president can be
referred to by George W. Bush or with his nick-
name Dubya. Thus, a many-to-many mapping be-
tween surface forms and entities has to be resolved.
In addition, entity mentions may not have a match-
ing entity in the KB, which is often the case for non-
popular entities.
Typical approaches to NED combine the use of
document context knowledge with entity informa-
tion stored in the KB in order to disambiguate en-
tities. Many systems represent document context
and KB information as word or concept vectors,
and rank entities using vector space similarity met-
rics (Cucerzan, 2007). Other authors employ su-
pervised machine learning algorithms to classify or
rank candidate entities (Bunescu and Pasca, 2006;
Zhang et al., 2010). Common features include pop-
ularity metrics based on Wikipedias graph structure
or on name mention frequency (Dredze et al., 2010;
Han and Zhao, 2009), similarity metrics explor-
ing Wikipedias concept relations (Han and Zhao,
2009), and string similarity features. Recent work
also addresses the task of NIL detection (Dredze et
al., 2010).
While previous research has largely focused on
disambiguating each entity mention in a document

<bodyText confidence="0.994423458333333">
\x0cseparately (McNamee and Dang, 2009), we explore
an approach that is driven by the observation that
entities normally co-occur in texts. Documents of-
ten discuss several different entities related to each
other, e.g. a news article may report on a meeting
of political leaders from different countries. Analo-
gously, entries in a KB such as Wikipedia are linked
to other, related entries.
Our Contributions In this paper, we evaluate a
range of novel disambiguation features that exploit
the relations between NEs identified in a document
and in the KB. Our goal is to explore the usefulness
of Wikipedias link structure as source of relations
between entities. We propose a method for candi-
date selection that is based on an inverted index of
surface forms and entities (Section 3.2). Instead of
a bag-of-words approach we use co-occurring NEs
in text for describing an ambiguous surface form.
We introduce several different disambiguation fea-
tures that exploit the relations between entities de-
rived from the graph structure of Wikipedia (Section
3.3). Finally, we combine our disambiguation fea-
tures and achieve state-of-the-art results with a Sup-
port Vector Machine (SVM) classifier (Section 4).

2 Problem statement
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.977963526315789">
The task of NED is to assign a surface form s found
in a document d to a target NE t E(s), where
E(s) E is a set of candidate NEs from an entity
KB that is defined by E = {e1, e2, ..., en}, or to
recognize that the found surface form s refers to a
missing target entity t /
E(s). For solving the task,
three main challenges have to be addressed:
Ambiguity Names of NEs may be ambiguous.
Since the same surface form s may refer to more
than one NE e, the correct target entity t has to be
determined from a set of candidates E(s)
Name variants Often, name variants (e.g. abbre-
viations, acronyms or synonyms) are used in texts
to refer to the same NE, which has to be considered
for the determination of candidates E(s) for a given
surface form s.
KB coverage KBs cover only a limited number
of NEs, mostly popular NEs. Another challenge of

distribution follows a power law, as many surface forms
have only a single meaning (i.e. refer to a single
Wikipedia concept), and some surface forms are highly
ambiguous, referring to very many different concepts.
NED is therefore to recognize missing NEs where

We formulate NED as a supervised binary classifi-
cation problem. In this section we describe the con-
struction and structure of the KB and the candidate
selection scheme, followed by an overview of dis-
ambiguation features and the candidate classifica-
tion algorithm.

3.1 Knowledge base construction
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.9996941875">
Our approach disambiguates named entities against
a KB constructed from Wikipedia. To this end, we
process Wikipedia to extract several types of infor-
mation for each Wikipedia article describing a con-
cept (i.e. any article not being a redirect page, a dis-
ambiguation page, or any other kind of meta page).
We collect a set of name variants (surface forms)
for each concept from article titles, redirect pages,
disambiguation pages and the anchor texts of inter-
nal Wikipedia links, following Cucerzan (2007). For
each concept, we also collect its set of incoming and
outgoing links to other Wikipedia pages. Finally, we
extract the articles full text. We store this informa-
tion in an inverted index, which allows for very ef-
ficient access and search during candidate selection
and feature computation.

\x0cThe distribution of surface forms follows a power
law, where the majority of surface forms is unam-
biguous, but some surface forms are very ambigu-
ous (Figure 1). This suggests that for a given set of
distinct surface forms found in a document, many of
these will unambiguously refer to a single Wikipedia
entity. These entities can then be used to disam-
biguate surface forms referring to multiple entities.

3.2 Candidate selection
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999268583333333">
Given a surface form identified in a document, the
task of the candidate selection component is to re-
trieve a set of candidate entities from the KB. To
this end, we execute a search on index fields storing
article titles, redirect titles, and name variants. We
implement a weighted search to give high weights
to exact title matches, a lesser emphasis on redi-
rect matches, and finally a low weight for all other
name variants. In addition, we implement a fuzzy
search on the title and redirect fields to select KB
entries with approximate string similarity to the sur-
face form.

<subsectionHeader confidence="0.998155">
3.3 Disambiguation features
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.9868950625">
In this section, we describe the features that we use
in our disambiguation approach.
Entity Context (EC) The EC disambiguation fea-
ture is calculated as the cosine similarity between
the document context d of a surface form s and the
Wikipedia article c of each candidate c E(s). We
represent both contexts as vectors of URIs. To create
d we extract all NEs from the text using the Stanford
NE Recognizer (Finkel et al., 2005) and represent
each NE by its Wikipedia URI. If a surface form is
ambiguous, we choose the most popular NE with the
popularity metric described below. Analogously, we
represent each c as a vector of the incoming and out-
going URIs found on its Wikipedia page.
Link Context (LC) The link context feature is an
extension of the EC feature. Since our observa-
tions have shown that the entity context can be very
small and consequently the overlap between d and
c may be very low, we extend d by all incoming
(LC-in) or by all incoming and outgoing (LC-all)
Wikipedia URIs of the NEs from the entity context.
We assume that Wikipedia pages that refer to other
Wikipedia pages contain information on the refer-
enced pages or at least are thematically related to
these pages. With the extension of d to d, we ex-
pect a higher overlap between the context vectors, so
that cos(d, c) cos(d, c).
Candidate Rank (CR) The features described so
far disambiguate every surface form s S from a
document d separately, whereas our Candidate Rank
feature aims to disambiguate all surface forms S
found in a document d at once. We represent d as
</bodyText>
<equation confidence="0.6427275">
a graph D = (E(S), L(E(S))) where the nodes
E(S) = sSE(s) are all candidates of all surface
</equation>
<bodyText confidence="0.998895409090909">
forms in the document and L(E(S)) is the set of
links between the candidates, as found in Wikipedia.
Then, we compute the PageRank score (Brin and
Page, 1998) of all c E(S) and choose for each
s the candidate with the highest PageRank score in
the document graph D.
Standard Features In addition to the previously
described features we also implement a set of com-
monly accepted features. These include a feature
based on the cosine similarity between word vector
representations of the document and the Wikipedia
article of each candidate (BOW) (Bunescu, 2007).
We perform stemming, remove stopwords, and
weight words with tf.idf in both cases. Another stan-
dard feature we use is the popularity of a surface
form (SFP). We calculate how often a surface form s
references a candidate c E(s) in relation to the to-
tal number of mentions of s in Wikipedia (Han and
Zhao, 2009). Since we use an index for selecting
candidates (Section 3.2), we also exploit the candi-
date selection score (CS) returned for each candidate
as a disambiguation feature.

3.4 Candidate classifier and NIL detection
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999655727272727">
We cast NED as a supervised classification task and
use two binary SVM classifiers (Vapnik, 1995). The
first classifier decides for each candidate c E(s) if
it corresponds to the target entity. Each candidate is
represented as a vector x(c) of features. For training
the classifier we label as a positive example at most
one x(c) from the set of candidates for a surface form
s, and all others as negative.
In addition, we train a separate classifier to detect
NIL queries, i.e. where all x(c) from E(s) are labeled
as negative examples. This may e.g. be the case

We conduct our experiments on the 2009 Knowl-
edge Base Population (KBP) dataset of the Text
Analysis Conference (TAC) (McNamee and Dang,
2009). The dataset consists of a KB derived from a
2008 snapshot of the English Wikipedia, and a col-
lection of newswire, weblog and newsgroup docu-
ments. A set of 3904 surface form-document pairs
(queries) is constructed from these sources, encom-
passing 560 unique entities. The majority of queries
(57%) are NIL queries, of the KB queries, 69%
are for organizations and 15% each for persons and
geopolitical entities. For each query the surface
form appearing in the given document has to be dis-
ambiguated against the KB.
We randomly split the 3904 queries to perform
10-fold cross-validation, and stratify the resulting
folds to ensure a similar distribution of KB and NIL
queries in our training data. After normalizing fea-
ture values to be in [0, 1], we train a candidate and
a NIL classifier on 90% of the queries in each it-
eration, and test using the remaining 10%. Results
reported in this paper are then averaged across the

our approach on KB and NIL queries for different

as the fraction of correct queries, and is the official
TAC-KBP evaluation measure. As a baseline we use
a feature set consisting of the BOW and SFP fea-
tures. The best feature set in our experiments com-

Our best accuracy of 0.84 compares favorably

which is significant at p = 0.05. For KB queries
our systems accuracy is higher than that of Dredze

queries, where our approach outperforms all previ-

difference in performance between using the LC-

feature slightly decreases the overall accuracy. A
manual inspection of the CR feature shows that of-
ten candidates cannot be distinguished by the clas-
sifier because they are assigned the same PageRank
scores. We assume this results from our use of uni-
form priors for the edges and vertices of the docu-

</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999890961538461">
We presented a supervised approach for named
entity disambiguation that explores novel features
based on Wikipedias link structure. These features
use NEs co-occurring with an ambiguous surface
form in a document and their Wikipedia relations to
score the candidates. Our system achieves state-of-
the-art results on the TAC-KBP 2009 dataset. We
find that our features improve disambiguation results
by 6.2% over the popularity baseline, and are espe-
cially helpful for recognizing entities not contained
in the KB.
In future work we plan to explore multilin-
gual data for NED. Since non-English versions of
Wikipedia often are less extensive than the English
version we find it promising to combine Wikipedia
versions of different languages and to use them as a
source for multilingual NED. For multilingual NED
evaluation we are currently working on a German
dataset, following the TAC-KBP dataset creation
guidelines. In addition to Wikipedia, we also intend
to exploit more dynamical information sources. For
example, when considering news articles, NEs of-
ten occur for a certain period of time in consecutive
news dealing with the same topic. This short-time
context could be a useful source of information for
disambiguating novel entities.

The goal of Named Entity Disambiguation (NED) is to label a surface form denoting an NE in text with one of multiple predefined NEs from a knowledge base (KB), or to detect that the surface form refers to an out-ofKB entity, which is known as NIL detection. NED has become a popular research field recently, as the growth of large-scale publicly available encyclopedic knowledge resources such as Wikipedia has stimulated research on linking NEs in text to their entries in these KBs (Bunescu and Pasca, 2006; McNamee and Dang, 2009). The disambiguation of named entities raises several challenges: Surface forms in text can be ambiguous, and the same entity can be referred to by different surface forms. For example, the surface form George Bush may denote either of two former U.S. presidents, and the later president can be referred to by George W. Bush or with his nickname Dubya. Thus, a many-to-many mapping between surface forms and entities has to be resolved. In addition, entity mentions may not have a matching entity in the KB, which is often the case for nonpopular entities. Typical approaches</context>

To this end, we process Wikipedia to extract several types of information for each Wikipedia article describing a concept (i.e. any article not being a redirect page, a disambiguation page, or any other kind of meta page). We collect a set of name variants (surface forms) for each concept from article titles, redirect pages, disambiguation pages and the anchor texts of internal Wikipedia links, following Cucerzan (2007). For each concept, we also collect its set of incoming and outgoing links to other Wikipedia pages. Finally, we extract the articles full text. We store this information in an inverted index, which allows for very efficient access and search during candidate selection and feature computation. 19 \x0cThe distribution of surface forms follows a power law, where the majority of surface forms is unambiguous, but some surface forms are very ambiguous (Figure 1).

In addition, we implement a fuzzy search on the title and redirect fields to select KB entries with approximate string similarity to the surface form. 3.3 Disambiguation features In this section, we describe the features that we use in our disambiguation approach. Entity Context (EC) The EC disambiguation feature is calculated as the cosine similarity between the document context d of a surface form s and the Wikipedia article c of each candidate c E(s). We represent both contexts as vectors of URIs. To create d we extract all NEs from the text using the Stanford NE Recognizer (Finkel et al., 2005) and represent each NE by its Wikipedia URI. If a surface form is ambiguous, we choose the most popular NE with the popularity metric described below. Analogously, we represent each c as a vector of the incoming and outgoing URIs found on its Wikipedia page. Link Context (LC) The link context feature is an extension of the EC feature. Since our observations have shown that the entity context can be very small and consequently the overlap between d and c may be very low, we extend d by all incoming (LC-in) or by all incoming and outgoing (LC-all) Wikipedia URIs of the NEs from the entity contex</context>

Using the best feature set improves the disambiguation accuracy by 6.2% over the baseline feature s</context>
