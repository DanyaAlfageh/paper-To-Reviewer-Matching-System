Then, we compute the PageRank score CITATION of all c E(S) and choose for each s the candidate with the highest PageRank score in the document graph D,,
These include a feature based on the cosine similarity between word vector representations of the document and the Wikipedia article of each candidate (BOW) CITATION,,
NED has become a popular research field recently, as the growth of large-scale publicly available encyclopedic knowledge resources such as Wikipedia has stimulated research on linking NEs in text to their entries in these KBs (CITATION; CITATION),,

We calculate how often a surface form s references a candidate c E(s) in relation to the total number of mentions of s in Wikipedia CITATION,,
Many systems represent document context and KB information as word or concept vectors, and rank entities using vector space similarity metrics CITATION,,
Other authors employ supervised machine learning algorithms to classify or rank candidate entities (CITATION; CITATION),,
Common features include popularity metrics based on Wikipedias graph structure or on name mention frequency (CITATION; CITATION), similarity metrics exploring Wikipedias concept relations CITATION, and string similarity features,,
Recent work also addresses the task of NIL detection CITATION,,
We collect a set of name variants (surface forms) for each concept from article titles, redirect pages, disambiguation pages and the anchor texts of internal Wikipedia links, following CITATION,,
Many systems represent document context and KB information as word or concept vectors, and rank entities using vector space similarity metrics CITATION,,

Recent work also addresses the task of NIL detection CITATION,,
While previous research has largely focused on disambiguating each entity mention in a document 18 \x0cseparately CITATION, we explore an approach that is driven by the observation that entities normally co-occur in texts,,
Table 1 compares the micro-averaged accuracy of our approach on KB and NIL queries for different feature sets, and lists the results of two other stateof-the-art systems (CITATION; CITATION), as well as the best and median reported performance of the 2009 TAC-KBP track CITATION,,
To create d we extract all NEs from the text using the Stanford NE Recognizer CITATION and represent each NE by its Wikipedia URI,,

4 Evaluation We conduct our experiments on the 2009 Knowledge Base Population (KBP) dataset of the Text Analysis Conference (TAC) CITATION,,
