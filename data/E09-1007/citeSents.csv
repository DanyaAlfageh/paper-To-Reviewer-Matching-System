To construct the distributional space associated to a corpus, we use a robust parser (in our experiments, we used XIP parser CITATION) to extract chunks (i.e,,
Each triple has the form w1.R.w2 where w1 and w2 are chunks and R is a syntactic relation CITATION, CITATION,,
In our experiments, first, we applied the XIP parser CITATION to the whole corpus in order to construct the frequency matrix D given by (1),,
2.4.1 The Relational Analysis approach We propose to apply the Relational Analysis approach (RA) which is a clustering model that doesnt require to fix the number of clusters CITATION, CITATION,,
For the second one, we exploited the annotations provided by XIP NER CITATION and we propagated these annotations to the different clusters (see 2.5.2),,
However, most of them do not build a NEs resource but exploit external gazetteers CITATION, CITATION,,
A recent overview of the field is given in CITATION,,
Our proposal is close to CITATION as it uses syntactic relations (2.2) and as it relies on existing NER systems (2.6.2),,
Fortunately, it also leads to a distribution of the clusters size (number of cliques by cluster) which is 6 For data fusion tasks in information retrieval field, the scoring method in equation (7) is denoted CombMNZ CITATION,,
Other scoring approaches can be used see for example CITATION,,

In our approach, a potential NE is a noun starting with an upper-case letter or a noun phrase which is (see CITATION for similar use): a governor argument of an attribute syntactic relation with a noun as governee argument (e.g,,
Maximal cliques computation was already employed for semantic space representation CITATION,,
For example, Oxford is an ambiguous NE but a clique such as &lt;Cambridge, Oxford, Edinburgh University, Edinburgh, Oxford University&gt; allows to focus on the specific annotation &lt;organization&gt; (see CITATION for similar use),,

From a methodological point of view, our proposal is also close to CITATION as the latter proposes a system for NEs finegrained annotation, which is also corpus dependent,,
In that context, CITATION presents a lightly supervised method for acquiring NEs in arbitrary categories from unstruct,,
