 The problem of finding an acceptable ordering does not arise solely in concept-to-text generation but also in the emerging field of text-to-text generation CITATION,,
 Although in single document summarization the position of a sentence in a document can provide cues with respect to its ordering in the summary, this is not the case in multidocument summarization where sentences are selected from different documents and must be somehow ordered so as to produce a coherent summary CITATION,,
 CITATION address the problem of information ordering in multidocument summarization and show that naive ordering algorithms such as majority ordering (selects most frequent orders across input documents) and chronological ordering (orders facts according to publication date) do not always yield coherent summaries although the latter produces good results when the information is eventbased,,

 Fortunately, they propose a simple greedy algorithm that provides an approximate solution which can be easily modified for our task (see also CITATION),,
 Finally, we assess whether this model can be used for multi-document summarization using data from CITATION,,
4 Experiment 3: Summarization CITATION collected a corpus of multiple orderings in order to study what makes an order cohesive,,
 Their goal was to improve the ordering strategy of MULTIGEN CITATION a multidocument summarization system that operates on news articles describing the same event,,

 We therefore smooth the observed frequencies using back-off smoothing CITATION,,
, continuity, salience) are of interest to concept-to-text generation as they offer an entity-based model of text and sentence planning which is particularly suited for descriptional genres CITATION,,
 A number of metrics can be used to measure the distance between two rankings such as Spearmans correlation coefficient for ranked data, Cayley distance, or Kendalls (see CITATION for details),,

 The problem of finding an acceptable ordering does not arise solely in concept-to-text generation but also in the emerging field of text-to-text generation CITATION,,
 As in the case of CITATION we construct an acceptable ordering rather than the best possible one,,
