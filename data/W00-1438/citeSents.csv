 Later work using lexical chains was conducted by CITATION using lexical chains to correct malapropisms,,
 CITATION dealt with some of tile limitations in Hirst and St-Onge\&apos;s algorithm by examining every possible lexical chain which could be computed, not just those possible at a given point in the text,,
 Currently, segmentation is accomplished prior to using our algorithm by executing Hearst\&apos;s text tiler CITATION,,
 Table 1 denotes sample metrics tuned to simulate the system devised by CITATION,,
6 Comparison with Previous Work As mentioned above, this research is based on the work of CITATION on lexical chains,,
 How these relations occur within a document is referred to as cohesion CITATION,,
