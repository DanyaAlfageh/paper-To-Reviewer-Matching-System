Quality assessment of a learned model output was explored by many previous works (see CITATION for a survey), and applied to several NL processing tasks such as syntactic parsing (CITATIONa; CITATION), machine translation CITATION, speech CITATION, relation extraction CITATION, IE CITATION, QA CITATION and dialog systems CITATION,,
This use of confidence estimation was explored in CITATION, to select between models trained with different random starting points,,
Multi-view learning is a well established idea, implemented in methods such as co-training CITATION,,
