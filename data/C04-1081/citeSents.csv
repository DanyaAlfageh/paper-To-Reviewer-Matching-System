For Chinese, there has been significant research on finding word boundaries in unsegmented sequences (see CITATION for a review),,
This is due to significant inconsistent segmentation in training and testing CITATION,,
However, a traditional maximum entropy tagger, as used in CITATION, labels characters without considering dependencies among the predicted segmentation labels that is inherent in the state transitions of finitestate sequence models,,
Unknown words cause segmentation errors in that these outof-vocabulary words in input text are often incorrectly segmented into single-character or other overly-short words CITATION,,
A recent advance in this area is CITATION, in which the author uses a sliding-window maximum entropy classifier to tag Chinese characters into one of four position tags, and then covert these tags into a segmentation using rules,,
See CITATION for more details and further experiments,,
An N-best list of labeling sequences can also be obtained using modified Viterbi algorithm and A* search CITATION,,
Linear-chain conditional random fields (CRFs) CITATION are models that address both issues above,,

Third, consider a comparison of our results with site S12, who use a sliding-window maximum entropy model CITATION,,
A recent Chinese word segmentation competition CITATION has made comparisons easier,,
CITATION uses class-based language for word segmentation where some word category information can be incorporated,,
Traditional maximum entropy learning algorithms, such as GIS and IIS (della CITATION), can be used to train CRFs,,
One solution to this problem could use a named entity extractor to recognize proper names; this was found to be very helpful in CITATION,,

In addition, compared to simple models like n-gram language models CITATION, another shortcoming of CRF-based segmenters is that it requires significantly longer training time,,
