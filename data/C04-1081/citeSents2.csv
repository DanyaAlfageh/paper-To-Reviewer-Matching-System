Segment confidence is estimated using constrained forward-backward CITATION,,
Traditional maximum entropy learning algorithms, such as GIS and IIS (della CITATION), can be used to train CRFs,,
The standard forward-backward algorithm CITATION calculates Zx, the total likelihood of all label sequences y given a sequence x,,
However, our implementation uses a quasi-Newton gradient-climber BFGS for optimization, which has been shown to converge much faster (CITATION; CITATION),,
