 For example, CITATION observed that EMD systems perform badly on noisy inputs, e,,
 CITATION also investigate design challenges for named entity recognition, and showed that other design choices, such as the representation of output labels and using features built on external knowledge, are more important than the learning model itself,,
 3 \x0cArgument Features Head words of the two arguments and their combination Entity mention labels of the two arguments and their combination Syntactic Features Sequence of dependency labels in the dependency path linking the heads of the two arguments Lemmas of all words in the dependency path Syntactic path in the constituent parse tree between the largest constituents headed by the same words as the two arguments (similar to CITATION) Surface Features Concatenation of POS tags between arguments Binary indicators set to true if there is an entity mention with a given type between the two arguments Table 1: Feature set used for RMD,,

 Our feature set is taken from (CITATION; CITATION; CITATION; CITATION) and models the relation arguments, the surface distance between the relation arguments, and the syntactic path between the two arguments, using both constituency and dependency representations,,
 For syntactic information, we used the Stanford parser CITATION and the Stanford dependency representation (de Marneffe et al,,
 For RMD, we implemented an additive feature selection algorithm similar to the one in CITATION, which iteratively adds the feature with the highest improvement in F1 score to the current feature set, until no improvement is seen,,
 In particular: We show that a combination of a conditional random field model CITATION with a rule-based approach that is recall oriented yields better performance for EMD and for the downstream RMD component,,
 The rulebased approach includes gazetteers, which have been shown to be important by CITATION, among others,,

 The rulebased approach includes gazetteers, which have been shown to be important by CITATION, among others,,
 While this can be achieved in different ways CITATION, in this paper we implement a very simple approach: we recognize NFLTEAM mentions with a rule-based system that extracts all token sequences that begin, end, or are equal to a known team name,,
