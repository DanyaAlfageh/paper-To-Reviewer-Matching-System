Our work can be seen as an attempt to generalize the intuition of caseframes (finding an entire set of events 1 We analyzed FrameNet CITATION for insight, but found that very few of the frames are event sequences of the type characterizing narratives and scripts,,
More recently, CITATION proposed an approach similar to caseframes that discovers highlevel relatedness between verbs by grouping verbs that share the same lexical items in subject/object positions,,
Finally, CITATION investigated script acquisition by extracting the 41 most frequent pairs of events from the first paragraph of newswire articles, using the assumption that the paragraphs textual order follows temporal order,,
3 The Narrative Chain Model 3.1 Definition Our model is inspired by Centering CITATION and other entity-based models of coherence CITATION in which an entity is in focus through a sequence of sentences,,
In summarization, topic signatures are a set of terms indicative of a topic CITATION,,
CITATION proposed the use of caseframe networks as a kind of contextual role knoweldge for anaphora resolution,,

We also draw from lexical chains CITATION, indicators of text coherence from word overl,,
793 \x0cThere are a number of algorithms for determining the temporal relationship between two events (CITATION; CITATION; CITATION), many of them trained on the TimeBank Corpus CITATION which codes events and their temporal relationships,,
The currently highest performing of these on raw data is the model of temporal labeling described in our previous work CITATION,,
CITATION shows 59.4% accuracy on the classification task for six possible relations between pairs of events: before, immediately-before, included-by, simultaneous, begins and ends,,
We use SVMs (CITATION uses Naive Bayes) and see minor performance boosts on Timebank,,
We also draw from lexical chains CITATION, indicators of text coherence from word overlap/similarity,,
Work on semantic similarity learning such as CITATION also automatically learns relations between verbs,,
Finally, CITATION investigated script acquisition by extracting the 41 most frequent pairs of events from the first paragraph of newswire articles, using the assumption that the paragraphs textual order follows temporal order,,
4.1 Evaluation Metric: Narrative Cloze The cloze task CITATION is used to evaluate a system (or human) for language proficiency by removing a random word from a sentence and having the system attempt to fill in the blank (e.g,,
CITATION proposed an extended task, discourse cloze, to evaluate discourse knowledge (removing phrases that are recoverable from knowledge of discourse relations like contrast and consequence),,

4.2 Narrative Cloze Experiment We use years 1994-2004 (1,007,227 documents) of the Gigaword Corpus CITATION for training2,,

Taking a cue from CITATION, we also increased Timebanks size by applying transitivity rules to the hand labeled data,,
In part due to its complexity, automatic induction has not been addressed since the early nonstatistical work of CITATION,,
More recently, CITATION proposed an approach similar to caseframes that discovers highlevel relatedness between verbs by grouping verbs that share the same lexical items in subject/object positions,,

They are related to structured sequences of participants and events that have been called scripts CITATION or Fillmorean frames,,
