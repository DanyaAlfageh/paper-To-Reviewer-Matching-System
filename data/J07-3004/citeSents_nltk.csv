Because of this preprocessing, the dependency structures in CCGbank are likely to be more consistent than those extracted directly from the Treebank via heuristics such as those given by CITATION and CITATION, and therefore may also be of immediate use for dependency-based approaches,,

A complete list of the lexical entries in sections 0221 of the Treebank which use this coindexation mechanism to project nonlocal dependencies is given in the CCGbank manual CITATION,,
Earlier versions of the resulting corpus, CCGbank, have already been used to build a number of wide-coverage statistical parsers (Clark, Hockenmaier, and Steedman 2002; CITATION; CITATIONb, 2003a; CITATION, 2007), which recover both local and long-range dependencies directly and in a single pass,,
The Treebank treats constructions such as the following as small clauses: (S (NP-SBJ that volume) (26) (VP (VBZ makes) (S (NP-SBJ it) (NP-PRD the largest supplier...in Europe)))) CITATION and CITATION) argue against this analysis on the basis of extractions like what does the country want forgiven, which suggest that these cases should rather be treated as involving two complements,,
(One exception is CITATION, whose Model 2 includes a distinction between arguments and adjuncts, and whose Model 3 additionally captures wh-movement in relative clauses with a GPSG-like slash-feature-passing mechanism.) The reasons for this shift away from linguis,,
For formalisms like LTAG, the relation is more complex, but the work of CITATION, who unfold CCG categories into TAG elementary trees via partial proof trees, and CITATION, who define LTAG spines that resemble categories, suggest that this is possible,,
Although certain decisions taken by the builders of the original Penn Treebank mean that the syntactic derivations that can be obtained from the Penn Treebank are not always semantically correct (as we will discuss), subsequent work by CITATION and CITATION has demonstrated that the output of parsers trained on CCGbank can also be directly translated into logical forms such as Discourse Representation Theory structures CITATION, which can then be used as input to a theorem prover in applications like question answering and textual entailment recognition,,
Furthermore, CITATION and CITATION have demonstrated that the output of CCGbank parsers can be successfully,,
Statistical parsers that are trained on these TAG and HPSG corpora have been presented by CITATION and CITATION, whereas the LFG parsing system of Cahill et al,,
However, because many of the known words with missing entries do not appear very often in the training data, CITATIONa) demonstrates that this problem can be partially alleviated if the frequency threshold below which rare words are treated as unseen is set to a much higher value than for standard Treebank parsers,,

Similar regularities have been recognized and given a categorial analysis by CITATION, who advocates lexical rules to account for the use of predicatives as adjuncts,,
For type-logical grammars (CITATION; CITATION; Moot 2003), this is little more than a matter of transducing the syntactic types for the lexicon into the appropriate notation,,
In CCG, verbs which take a bare sentential complement have the category ((S\\NP)/NPi )/(S\\NPi ) if the subject of the sentential complement is extracted CITATION,,
For our translation algorithm, the *T* traces are essential: They indicate the presence of a long-range dependency for a particular argument of the verb, and allow us to use a mechanism similar to GPSGs slash-feature passing CITATION, so that long-range dependencies are represented in the gold-standard dependency structures of the test and training data,,
For coordination, we will use a binarized version of the following ternary rule schema:5 Coordination: X: f conj X: g & X : x.fx gx (7) For further explanation and linguistics and computational motivation for this theory of grammar, the reader is directed to CITATION, 2000),,

These constituents are obtained by type-raising and composing the arguments in each conjunct, yielding a functor which takes a verb with the appropriate category to its left to yield a verb phrase (CITATION; CITATION),,

4.1 Determining Constituent Types: Heads, Complements, and Adjuncts First, the constituent type of each node (head (h), complement (c), or adjunct (a)) is determined, using heuristics adapted from CITATION and CITATION, which take the label of a node and its parent into account.6 We assume that NP daughters of VPs are complements, unless they carry a function tag such as -LOC, -DIR, -TMP, and so on, but treat all PPs as adjuncts unless they carry the -CLR function tag,,
Such representations are provided by grammar formalisms that are more expressive than simple phrase-structure grammar, like Lexical-Functional Grammar (LFG) CITATION, Head-driven Phrase-Structure Grammar (HPSG) CITATION, Tree-Adjoining Grammar (TAG) CITATION, Minimalist Programrelated Grammars CITATION, or Combinatory Categorial Grammar (CCG) (CITATION, 2000),,
All variants of categorial grammar since CITATION and CITATION include function application, where a functor X/Y or X\\Y is applied to an argument Y: Forward Application: X/Y : f Y : a X : fa Backward Application: Y : a X\\Y : f X : fa (3) 2 This is the result-leftmost notation, which is easiest to mentally translate into the corresponding semantic type,,
Statistical parsers that are trained on these TAG and HPSG corpora have been presented by CITATION and ,,

In a future version of CCGbank, it may be possible to follow CITATION in using the semantic roles of the Proposition Bank (Palmer, Gildea, and Kingsbury 2005) to distinguish arguments and adjuncts,,

This phenomenon could be handled elegantly with a feature hierarchy over categories as proposed by CITATION, CITATION, and CITATION,,
Because treebank annotation for individual formalisms is prohibitively expensive, there have been a number of efforts to extract TAGs, LFGs, and, more recently, HPSGs, from the Penn Treebank (CITATION; Chen and Vijay-Shanker 2000; Xia, Palmer, and Joshi 2000; ,,
If these rules apply recursively to their own output, they can generate an infinite set of category types, leading to a shift in generative power from context-free to recursively enumerable (CITATION, 1992),,

As some indication of the relative ease with which these techniques transfer, we offer the observation that the 900K-word German Tiger dependency corpus has recently been translated into CCG using very similar techniques by CITATION, and CITATION has derived a,,

An alternative approach, advocated by CITATION, is to use a supertagger which predicts lexical CCG categories in combination with a discriminative,,
CITATION show that this lexical coverage problem does in practice have a significant impact on overall parsing accuracy,,
Extensions of CCG to other languages and word-orders are discussed by CITATION, CITATION, CITATION, CITATION, CITATION, CITATION, CITATION, and CITATION,,
Such representations are provided by grammar formalisms that are more expressive than simple phrase-structure grammar, like Lexical-Functional Grammar (LFG) CITATION, Head-driven Phrase-S,,
Unless the parenthetical element itself is of a type that could be a modifier by itself (e.g., a PP), we assume that the opening parenthesis or first dash takes the parenthetical element as argument and yields a modifier of the appropriate type: (PRN (: --) (25) (NP (NP the third-highest) (PP-LOC in the developing world))) This results in the following derivation, which ignores the fact that parentheses are usually balanced CITATION: NP\\NP (NP\\NP)/NP NP the third-highest in the developing world 371 \x0cComputational Linguistics Volume 33, Number 3 We use a similar treatment for other constituents that appear after colons and dashes, such as sentence-final appositives, or parentheticals that are not marked as PRN,,
