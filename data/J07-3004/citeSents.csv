For type-logical grammars (CITATION; CITATION; Moot 2003), this is little more than a matter of transducing the syntactic types for the lexicon into the appropriate notation,,

For our translation algorithm, the *T* traces are essential: They indicate the presence of a long-range dependency for a particular argument of the verb, and allow us to use a mechanism similar to GPSGs slash-feature passing CITATION, so that long-range dependencies are represented in the gold-standard dependency structures of the test and training data,,
An alternative approach, advocated by CITATION, is to use a supertagger which predicts lexical CCG categories in combination with a discriminative,,
This phenomenon could be handled elegantly with a feature hierarchy over categories as proposed by CITATION, CITATION, and CITATION,,

If these rules apply recursively to their own output, they can generate an infinite set of category types, leading to a shift in generative power from context-free to recursively enumerable (CITATION, 1992),,

These constituents are obtained by type-raising and composing the arguments in each conjunct, yielding a functor which takes a verb with the appropriate category to its left to yield a verb phrase (CITATION; CITATION),,

Unless the parenthetical element itself is of a type that could be a modifier by itself (e.g., a PP), we assume that the opening parenthesis or first dash takes the parenthetical element as argument and yields a modifier of the appropriate type: (PRN (: --) (25) (NP (NP the third-highest) (PP-LOC in the developing world))) This results in the following derivation, which ignores the fact that parentheses are usually balanced CITATION: NP\\NP (NP\\NP)/NP NP the third-highest in the developing world 371 \x0cComputational Linguistics Volume 33, Number 3 We use a similar treatment for other constituents that appear after colons and dashes, such as sentence-final appositives, or parentheticals that are not marked as PRN,,

4.1 Determining Constituent Types: Heads, Complements, and Adjuncts First, the constituent type of each node (head (h), complement (c), or adjunct (a)) is determined, using heuristics adapted from CITATION and CITATION, which take the label of a node and its parent into account.6 We assume that NP daughters of VPs are complements, unless they carry a function tag such as -LOC, -DIR, -TMP, and so on, but treat all PPs as adjuncts unless they carry the -CLR function tag,,
If function tags are ignored, the grammar for the corresponding sections of the original Treebank contains 12,409 phrase-structure rules, out of which 6,765 occur only once CITATION,,

358 \x0cHockenmaier and Steedman CCGbank These rules give rise to derivations like the following:4 I give them money NP :I ((S\\NP)/NP)/NP : xyz.give\x01 yxz NP : them\x01 NP : money\x01 > (S\\NP)/NP : yz.give\x01 y them\x01 z > S\\NP : z.give\x01 money\x01 them\x01 z < S : give\x01 money\x01 them\x01 I\x01 (4) This derivation is isomorphic to a traditional context-free derivation tree like the following (the semantics is omitted): S NP I S\\NP (S\\NP)/NP ((S\\NP)/NP)/NP give NP them NP money CCG additionally introduces a set of rule schemata based on the combinators of combinatory logic CITATION, which enable succinct analyses of extraction and coordination constructions,,
Although there is now a sizable literature on trace and function-tag insertion algorithms (CITATION; CITATION; CITATION), and integrated parsing with function tags or null elements (CITATIONa, 2003b; CITATION; Gabbard, Kulick, and Marcus 2006), such approaches typically require additional pre- or postprocessing steps that are likely to add further noise and errors to the parser output,,

Because of this preprocessing, the dependency structures in CCGbank are likely to be more consistent than those extracted directly from the Treebank via heuristics such as those given by CITATION and CITATION, and therefore may also be of immediate use for dependency-based approaches,,
Although certain decisions taken by the builders of the original Penn Treebank mean that the syntactic derivations that can be obtained from the Penn Treebank are not always semantically correct (as we will discuss), subsequent work by CITATION and CITATION has demonstrated that the output of parsers trained on CCGbank can also be directly translated into logical forms such as Discourse Representation Theory structures CITATION, which can then be used as input to a theorem prover in applications like question answering and textual entailment recognition,,
