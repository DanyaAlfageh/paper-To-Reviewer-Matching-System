3.2 Tree-to-Tree Model The Quasi-Synchronous Grammar formalism CITATION is a generative model that aims to produce the most likely target tree for a given source tree,,
It differs from the more strict synchronous grammar formalisms (CITATION; CITATION) because it does not try to perform simultaneous parsing on parallel grammars; instead, the model learns an augmented target-language grammar whose rules make soft alignments with a given source tree,,
QG has been applied to some NLP tasks other than MT, including answer selection for question-answering CITATION, paraphrase identification CITATION, and parser adaptation and projection CITATION,,
