A similar line of thinking can be applied to lexical or semantic graphs extracted from natural language documents, resulting in a graph-based ranking model called TextRank CITATION, which can be used for a variety of natural language processing applications where knowledge drawn from an entire text is used in making local ranking/selection decisions,,

For a comparative evaluation, Table 2 shows the results obtained on this data set by the top 5 (out of 15) performing systems participating in the single document summarization task at CITATION CITATION,,
For evaluation, we are using the ROUGE evaluation toolkit, which is a method based on Ngram statistics, found to be highly correlated with human evaluations (CITATIONa),,
CITATION), have been traditionally and successfully used in citation analysis, social networks, and the analysis of the link-structure of the World Wide Web,,
Such text-oriented ranking methods can be applied to tasks ranging from automated extraction of keyphrases, to extractive summarization and word sense disambiguation CITATION,,
1 Introduction Graph-based ranking algorithms, such as Kleinbergs HITS algorithm CITATION or Googles PageRank CITATION, have been traditionally and successfully used in citation analysis, social networks, and the analysis of the link-structure of the World Wide Web,,
POSP (Vi) = 1 |V | X Vj Out(Vi) (1 + POSP (Vj)) (3) The counterpart of the positional power function is the positional weakness function, defined as: POSW (Vi) = 1 |V | X Vj In(Vi) (1 + POSW (Vj)) (4) \x0c2.3 PageRank PageRank CITATION is perhaps one of the most popular ranking algorithms, and was designed as a method for Web link analysis,,
2.1 HITS HITS (Hyperlinked Induced Topic Search) CITATION is an iterative algorithm that was designed for ranking Web pages according to their degree of authority,,
It is also notable the study reported in (CITATIONb) discussing the usefulness and limitations of automatic sentence extraction for summarization, which emphasizes the need of accurate tools for sentence extraction, as an integral part of automatic summarization systems,,
1 The factor d is usually set at 0.85 CITATION, and this is the value we are also using in our implementation,,
Previous approaches include supervised learning CITATION, vectorial similarity computed between an initial abstract and sentences in the given document, or intra-document similarities CITATION,,
4 Evaluation The TextRank sentence extraction algorithm is evaluated in the context of a single-document summarization task, using 567 news articles provided during the Document Understanding Evaluations 2002 CITATION,,
Among all algorithms, the HITSA and PageRank algorithms provide the best performance, at par with the best performing system from CITATION5,,
