A similar approach is explored in CITATION, which uses Topic Signatures CITATION constructed around the target individuals name to identify sentences to be included in the biography,,
Extracted sentences are then rewritten using a reference rewriting system CITATION which attempts to shorten subsequent references to the target,,
CITATIONs biography generation system, like ours, trains biographical and non-biographical sentence classifiers to select sentences to be included in the biography,,
