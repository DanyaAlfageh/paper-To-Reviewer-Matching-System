We utilize the Stanford tools (CITATION; CITATION; Marneffe et al., 2006),,
CITATION extract unlabeled networks where the nodes represent characters and edges indicate their proximity, as indicated by their interactions,,
In addition, research on spoken language processing for broadcast and multi-party meetings (CITATION; CITATION) has demonstrated that the analysis of dialogues is useful for the study of social interactions,,
In spite of a frequently expressed opinion that all novels are simply variations of a certain number of basic plots CITATION, every novel has a unique plot (or several plots) and a different set of characters,,
d, are extracted from the communication category of WordNet CITATION,,
A preliminary manual inspection of the set of relations extracted by this method CITATION indicates that all of them are correct, and include about 40% all personal relations that can be inferred by a human reader from the text of the novel,,
This preprocessing step could also be performed automatically using a canonicalization method CITATION; however, since our focus is on speaker identification, we decided to avoid introducing annotation errors at this stage,,
The verbs, such as said and cried, are extracted from the communication category of WordNet CITATION,,
We implement our approach with SVMrank CITATION,,
CITATION identify opinion holders by using semantic parsing techniques with additional linguistic features,,
A Logistic Regression classifier CITATION was trained to identify the vocatives,,
CITATION aim at detecting direct speech quotations in multilingual news,,
CITATION propose a rule generalization method with a scoring scheme that focuses on the speech verbs,,
CITATION (henceforth referred to as EM2010) apply the supe,,
CITATION automatically tag speech sentences in newspaper articles,,
CITATION (henceforth referred to as EM2010) apply the supervised machine learning paradigm to a corpus of utterances extracted from novels,,
CITATION present a similar approach for extracting speech quotes from online news texts,,
5.4 Unsupervised Actor-Topic Features The final set of features is generated by the unsupervised actor-topic model (ACTM) CITATION, which requires no annotated training data,,
Finally, CITATION implement a rule-based system to enrich German cabinet protocols with automatic speaker attribution,,
