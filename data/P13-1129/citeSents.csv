 A Logistic Regression classifier CITATION was trained to identify the vocatives,,
 This preprocessing step could also be performed automatically using a canonicalization method CITATION; however, since our focus is on speaker identification, we decided to avoid introducing annotation errors at this stage,,
 We utilize the Stanford tools (CITATION; CITATION; Marneffe et al,,
 CITATION identify opinion holders by using semantic parsing techniques with additional linguistic features,,
 CITATION aim at detecting direct speech quotations in multilingual news,,
 CITATION automatically tag speech sentences in newspaper articles,,
 Finally, CITATION implement a rule-based system to enrich German cabinet protocols with automatic speaker attribution,,
4 Unsupervised Actor-Topic Features The final set of features is generated by the unsupervised actor-topic model (ACTM) CITATION, which requires no annotated training data,,

 CITATION (henceforth referred to as EM2010) apply the supervised machine learning paradigm to a corpus of utterances extracted from novels,,
 CITATION extract unlabeled networks where the nodes represent characters and edges indicate their proximity, as indicated by their interactions,,
 In addition, research on spoken language processing for broadcast and multi-party meetings (CITATION; CITATION) has demonstrated that the analysis of dialogues is useful for the study of social interactions,,

 CITATION (henceforth referred to as EM2010) apply the supervised machine learning paradigm to a corpus of utterances extracted from novels,,
 In spite of a frequently expressed opinion that all novels are simply variations of a certain number of basic plots CITATION, every novel has a unique plot (or several plots) and a different set of characters,,
 This preprocessing step could also be performed automatically using a canonicalization method CITATION; however, since our focus is on speaker identification, we decided to avoid introducing annotation errors at this stage,,
