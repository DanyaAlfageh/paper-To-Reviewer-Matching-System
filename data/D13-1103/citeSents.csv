x CITATION for each behavior feature from the Table 1,,
This work was further extended by CITATION to predict the gaze position from mouse cursor movement, with mean error of about 150 px,,
eature has been previously shown to be correlated with examination time, measured by eye-tracking experiments CITATION, and it helps us detect local behavior in the neighborhood of a specific text passage,,
The QA-SYS performs Part of Speech tagging using Stanford POS tagger CITATION, and Named Entity Recognition using Stanford NER CITATION, and then builds a Lucene index over the set of input documents,,
me cases, passage retrieval can even serve as the final product of a Question Answering system CITATION,,
It has been previously recognized that searcher interactions could be valuable for question answering, and a task on Complex Interactive QA has been ran as part of TREC 2007 CITATION,,
As originally reported by CITATION, the authors discovered the coordination between a users eye movements and mouse movements when scanning a web search results page,,
ncy relations between the question terms, CITATION incorporated syntactic structure and answer typing, while CITATION used semantic analysis at all stages of the question answering process,,
We also evaluate ROUGE-1 metric CITATION for the first retrieved passage,,
4.1 Text-Based Passage Retrieval We adopt an open-source question answering framework QANUS CITATION (version v29Nov2012),,
We implemented the readability features from CITATION, and query matching features from CITATION,,
We also take a scrollbar and event count features from papers (CITATIONb), and CITATION to detect evidence of reading vs,,
In particular, CITATION proposed a method to extract text passages of Web pages based on the users mouse activity and found that extracted passages based on mo,,
For example, CITATION exploited dependency relations between the question terms, CITATION incorporated syntactic structure and answer typing, while CITATION used semantic analysis at all stages of the question answering process,,
g QA system from TREC CITATION,,
Most closely related to this work is a contemporaneous effort on improving web search result summaries, or snippets, by exploiting searcher behavior on the examined documents, described by CITATION,,
Behavior Feature Importance Analysis: To estimate relative importance of behavior features we evaluated the Gini importance index CITATION for each behavior feature from the Table 1,,
Evaluation Metrics: We evaluate passage retrieval performance by standard Mean Reciprocal Rank (MRR), and Mean Average Precision (MAP) metrics for top 20 retrieved sentences CITATION,,
Furthermore, it has been recognized that the questions used in traditional TREC QA evaluation may not be reflective of the real questions, posed by users CITATION,,
The first algorithm is Regression Tree CITATION, and the second is Gradient Boosting Regression Tree algorithm (Fri,,
First, a passage score is obtained from the QASYS system CITATION, resulting in a strong text-only baseline that generates candidate passages,,
The interested reader can obtain an overview of the relevant privacy issues and proposed solutions in references (CITATION; CITATION),,
On the downside, the questions and queries from real users are often not grammatical or well-formed, differing from the questions used in the traditional TREC Question Answering evaluations (CITATION; CITATION),,
Extracted text is divided into sentences using Punkt unsupervised sentence split1014 \x0cter CITATION,,
mination time, measured by eye-tracking experiments CITATION, and it helps us detect local behavior in the neighborhood of a specific text passage,,
CITATION report a thorough comparison of passage retrieval methods for QA, up to 2003,,
Recently, CITATION proposed a method that uses text selections as implicit feedback for document ranking,,
ASYS implements many of the state-of-the-art question answering techniques, and is similar to a topperforming QA system from TREC CITATION,,
The first feature has been shown to be a good feature for re-ranking search results in reference (CITATIONb), and we have shown that it is also useful for passage retrieval,,
The first algorithm is Regression Tree CITATION, and the second is Gradient Boosting Regression Tree algorithm CITATION,,
also studied the prediction of salient Web page regions using eye-tracking (CITATIONa),,
As another example, redundancy in the retrieved passages has been used by the AskMSR system CITATION to select answers,,
In particular, CITATION proposed a method to extract text passages of Web pages based on the users mouse activity and found that extracted passages based on mouse ac1012 \x0ctivity such as text tracing, link pointing, link clicking and text selection enable more accurate extraction of key words of interest than using the whole text of the page,,
In the first stage, the downloaded HTML pages are pre-processed with Natural Language Tool Kit (NLTK, CITATION),,
The MouseOverTime feature has been previously shown to be correlated with examination time, measured by eye-tracking experiments CITATION, and it helps us detect local behavior in the neighborhood of a specific text passage,,
As originally reported by CITATION, the authors discovered the coordination between a users eye movements and mouse moveme,,

QASYS implements many of the state-of-the-art question answering techniques, and is similar to a topperforming QA system from TREC CITATION,,
usly recognized that searcher interactions could be valuable for question answering, and a task on Complex Interactive QA has been ran as part of TREC 2007 CITATION,,
In some cases, passage retrieval can even serve as the final product of a Question Answering system CITATION,,
To collect sufficient amount of search behavior data, we adapted for our task the publicly available UFindIt architecture, described in reference CITATION,,
