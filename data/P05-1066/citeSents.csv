 (CITATION; CITATION) describe the use of syntactic features in reranking the output of a full translation system, but the syntactic features give very small gains: for example the majority of the gain in performance in the experiments in CITATION was due to the addition of IBM Model 1 translation probabilities, a non-syntactic feature,,
