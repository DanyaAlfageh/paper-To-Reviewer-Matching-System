2.1.2 Research on Syntax-Based SMT A number of researchers (CITATION; CITATION; CITATION; CITATION; CITATION; CITATION; CITATION) have proposed models where the translation process involves syntactic representations of the source and/or target languages,,
See CITATION for an approach of this form, which shows improvements in accuracy over a baseline system,,
A number of other re532 \x0csearchers (CITATION; CITATION; CITATION) have described previous work on preprocessing methods,,
CITATION describe an approach that targets translation of French phrases of the form NOUN de NOUN (e.g., conflit dinteret),,

1 Introduction Recent research on statistical machine translation (SMT) has lead to the development of phrasebased systems (CITATION; CITATION; CITATION),,
These methods go beyond the original IBM machine translation models CITATION, by allowing multi-word units (phrases) in one language to be translated directly into phrases in another language,,
Results using the method show an improvement from 25.2% Bleu score to 26.8% Bleu score (a statistically significant improvement), using a phrase-based system CITATION which has been shown in the past to be a highly competitive SMT system,,
2 Background 2.1 Previous Work 2.1.1 Research on Phrase-Based SMT The original work on statistical machine translation was carried out by researchers at IBM CITATION,,
More recently, phrase-based models (CITATION; CITATION; CITATION) have been proposed as a highly successful alternative to the IBM models,,
In this paper we use the phrase-based system of CITATION as our underlying model,,
(CITATION; CITATION) describe the use of syntactic features in reranking the output of a full translation system, but the syntactic features give very small gains: for example the majority of the gain in performance in the experiments in CITATION was due to the addition of IBM Model 1 translation probabilities, a non-syntactic feature,,

As a first step in the reordering process, we parse the sentence using the parser described in CITATION,,
Note that previous work (CITATION; CITATION) has suggested the use of bootstrap tests CITATION for the calculation of confidence intervals for Bleu scores,,
CITATION gives empirical evidence that these give accurate estimates for Bleu statistics,,
However, correctness of the bootstrap method relies on some technical properties of the statistic (e.g., Bleu scores) being used (e.g., see CITATION theorem 8.3); (CITATION; CITATION) do not discuss whether Bleu scores meet any such criteria, which makes us uncertain of their correctness when applied to Bleu scores,,
2.1.2 Research on Syntax-Based SMT A number of researchers (CITATION; CITATION; CITATION; CITATION; CITATION; CITATION; CITATION) have proposed models where the translation process involves syntactic representations of the source and/or target languages,,
Our method differs from that of CITATION in a couple of important respects,,
als CITATION use of reordering rules stated at the context-free level differs from ours,,

In practice, when training the parameters of an SMT system, for example using the discriminative methods of CITATION, the cost for skips of this kind is typically set to a very high value,,
In experiments with the system of CITATION we have found that in practice a large number of complete translations are completely monotonic (i.e., have skips), suggesting that the system has difficulty learning exactly what points in the translation should allow reordering,,
Our baseline is the phrase-based MT system of CITATION,,
We use BLEU scores CITATION to measure translation accuracy,,
We used the sign test (e.g., see page 166 of CITATION) to test the statistical significance of our results,,
