Additionally, we present results of the tagger on the NEGRA corpus CITATION and the Penn Treebank CITATION,,
2.3 Handling of Unknown Words Currently, the method of handling unknown words that seems to work best for inflected languages is a suffix analysis as proposed in CITATION,,
For a comparison to other taggers, the reader is referred to CITATION,,
Nevertheless, a recent independent comparison of 7 taggets CITATION has shown that another approach even works better: Markov models combined with a good smoothing technique and with handling of unknown words,,
Nevertheless, a recent independent comparison of 7 taggets CITATION has shown that another approach even works better: Markov models combined with a good smoothing technique a,,
A theoretical motivated argumentation uses the standard deviation of the maximum likelihood probabilities for the weights 0i CITATION This leaves room for interpretation,,
226 \x0c2.5 Beam Search The processing time of the Viterbi algorithm CITATION can be reduced by introducing a beam search,,
As two examples, CITATION and CITATION give good overviews of the techniques and equations used for Markov models and part-ofspeech tagging, but they are not very explicit in the details that are needed for their application,,
For the Penn Treebank, CITATION reports an accuracy of 96.6% using the Maximum Entropy approach, our much simpler and therefore faster HMM approach delivers 96.7%,,
The annotation consists of four parts: 1) a context-free structure augmented with traces to mark movement and discontinuous constituents, 2) phrasal categories that are annotated as node labels, 3) a small set of grammatical functions that are annotated as extensions to the node labels, and 4) part-of-speech tags CITATION,,
According to current tagger comparisons (van Halteren et al., 1998; CITATION), and according to a comparsion of the results presented here with those in CITATION, the Maximum Entropy framework seems to be the only other approach yielding comparable results to the one presented here,,
Recent comparisons of approaches that can be trained on corpora (van Halteren et al., 1998; CITATION) have shown that in most cases statistical aproaches (CITATION; CITATION; CITATION) yield better results than finite-state, rule-based, or memory-based taggers (CITATION; CITATION),,
3.1 Tagging the NEGRA corpus The German NEGRA corpus consists of 20,000 sentences (355,000 tokens) of newspaper texts (Frankfurter Rundschau) that are annotated with parts-ofspeech and predicate-argument structures CITATION,,
s two examples, CITATION and CITATION give good overviews of the techniques and equations used for Markov models and part-ofspeech tagging, but they are not very explicit in the details that are needed for their application,,
The Penn Treebank results reported here for the Markov model approach are at least equivalent to those reported for the Maximum Entropy approach in CITATION,,
