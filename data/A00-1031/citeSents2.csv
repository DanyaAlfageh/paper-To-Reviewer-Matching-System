Nevertheless, a recent independent comparison of 7 taggets CITATION has shown that another approach even works better: Markov models combined with a good smoothing technique and with handling of unknown words,,
Recent comparisons of approaches that can be trained on corpora (van Halteren et al., 1998; CITATION) have shown that in most cases statistical aproaches (CITATION; CITATION; CITATION) yield better results than finite-state, rule-based, or memory-based taggers (CITATION; CITATION),,
Additionally, we present results of the tagger on the NEGRA corpus CITATION and the Penn Treebank CITATION,,
For the Penn Treebank, CITATION reports an accuracy of 96.6% using the Maximum Entropy approach, our much simpler and therefore faster HMM approach delivers 96.7%,,
The Penn Treebank results reported here for the Markov model approach are at least equivalent to those reported for the Maximum Entropy approach in CITATION,,
According to current tagger comparisons (van Halteren et al., 1998; CITATION), and according to a comparsion of the results presented here with those in CITATION, the Maximum Entropy framework seems to be the only other approach yielding comparable results to the one presented here,,
For a comparison to other taggers, the reader is referred to CITATION,,
