 To give an idea of the informative features used in the classifier of a slot, we rank the features used for a slot classifier according to their correlation metric values (CITATIONa), where informative features are ranked higher,,
 They are automatically derived based on the correlation metric value used in (CITATIONa),,

 The features of an example are derived from the treebank-style parse tree output by an implementation of Collins' parser CITATION,,
 While a machine learning approach is used in CITATION to determine general semantic roles, we used a simple rule-based traversal of the parse tree instead, which could also reliably determine the generic agent and patient role of a sentence, and this suffices for our current purpose,,
 Support Vector Machine (Alice-SVM) The Support Vector Machine (SVM) CITATION has been successfully used in many recent applications such as text categorization and handwritten digit recognition,,
net Naive Bayes (Alice-NB) The Naive Bayes (NB) algorithm CITATION assumes the independence of features given the class and assigns a test example to the class which has the highest posterior probability,,
 Decision Tree (Alice-DT) The decision tree (DT) algorithm CITATION partitions training examples using the feature with the highest information gain,,
