1 Introduction Cross-language document summarization is defined as the task of producing a summary in a different target language for a set of documents in a source language CITATION.,,
CITATION propose to generate a Japanese summary by using Korean summarizer.,,
CITATION propose to produce summaries with the MMR method from Romanian news articles and then automatically translate the summaries into English.,,
Cross language query based summarization has been investigated in CITATION, where the query and the documents are in different languages.,,
CITATION adopt the summary translation scheme for the task of English-to-Chinese cross-language summarization.,,
Other related work includes multilingual summarization (CITATION; CITATION), which aims to create summaries from multiple sources in multiple languages.,,
In future work, we will investigate to use the machine translation quality factor to further improve the fluency of the Chinese summary, as in CITATION.,,
For multi-document summarization, some sentences are highly overlapping with each other, and thus we apply the same greedy algorithm in CITATION to penalize the sentences highly overlapping with other highly scored sentences, and finally the salient and novel Chinese sentences are directly selected as summary sentences.,,
CITATION formulate extractive summarization as a two-step learning problem by building a generative model for pattern discovery and a regression model for inference.,,
CITATION propose an A* search algorithm to find the best extractive summary up to a given length, and they propose a discriminative training algorithm for directly maximizing the quality of the best summary.,,
