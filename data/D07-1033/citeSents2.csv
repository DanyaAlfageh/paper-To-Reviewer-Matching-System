The performance of the related work (CITATION; CITATION) is listed in Table 4,,
Method dev test CITATION CITATION baseline CRF - 85.51 + non-local features - 86.86 CITATION CITATION baseline CRF - 85.29 + non-local features - 87.24 Table 5: Summary of performance with POS/chunk tags by TagChunk,,
We adopted IOB (IOB2) labeling CITATION, where the first word of an entity of class C is labeled B-C, the words in the entity are labeled I-C, and other words are labeled O,,
Although several methods have already been proposed to incorporate non-local features (CITATION; CITATION; CITATION; CITATION; CITATION; CITATION), these present a problem that the types of non-local features are somewhat constrained,,
For example, CITATION enabled the use of non-local features by using Gibbs sampling,,
We also implemented the majority version of these features as used in CITATION,,
However, the achieved accuracy was not better than that of related work (CITATION; CITATION) based on CRFs,,
We used non-local features based on CITATION,,
For example, non-local features such as same phrases in a document do not have different entity classes were shown to be useful in named entity recognition (CITATION; CITATION; CITATION; CITATION),,
The resulting performance of the proposed algorithm with non-local features is higher than that of CITATION and comparable with that of CITATION,,
