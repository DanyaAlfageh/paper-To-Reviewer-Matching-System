Some stem from work on graphical models, including loopy belief propagation (CITATION; CITATION), Gibbs sampling CITATION, sequential Monte Carlo methods such as particle filtering CITATION, and variational inference (CITATION; CITATION; CITATION),,
These include beam search CITATION, cube pruning, which we discuss in 3, integer linear programming (Roth a,,
Also relevant are stacked learning CITATION, interpretable as approximation of non-local feature values CITATION, and M-estimation CITATION, which allows training without inference,,
