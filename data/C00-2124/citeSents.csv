 This grammar is then used by the CASS parser CITATION,,
 For every class the weights of the active features are combined and the best scoring class is chosen CITATION,,
 The model was calculated using existing software CITATION,,
 MBSL CITATION uses POS data in order to identify baseNPs,,

 Based on an earlier combination study (Tjong Kim CITATION) we had expected the voting methods to do better,,
 For every class the weights of the active features are combined and the best scoring class is chosen CITATION,,
 The model was calculated using existing software CITATION,,
 MBSL CITATION uses POS data in order to identify baseNPs,,
 (1998) and CITATION show that part-of-speech tagger performance can be improved by combining di\x0berent taggers,,
 The Open predictor is learned using SNoW (CITATION; CITATION) as a function of features that utilize words and POS tags in the sentence and, given a new sentence, will predict for each word whether it is the \x0crst word in the phrase or not,,
 For every class the weights of the active features are combined and the best scoring class is chosen CITATION,,
 The model was calculated using existing software CITATION,,
 MBSL CITATION uses POS data in order to identify baseNPs,,
 (1999) but instead used the strategy outlined in Tjong Kim Sang CITATION: regard only the shortest possible phrases between candidate open and close brackets as base noun phrases,,
 An alternative representation for baseNPs has been put forward by CITATION,,
 The approach we have chosen here is the same as in Tjong Kim Sang CITATION: generate di\x0berent variants of the task by using di\x0berent representations of the output (IOB1, IOB2, IOE1, IOE2 and O+C),,
 We expect the systems which use this combination phase to perform better than their individual members (Tjong Kim CITATION),,

 Two baseNP data sets have been put forward by CITATION,,
 The main data set consist of four sections of the Wall Street Journal (WSJ) part of the Penn Treebank CITATION as training material (sections 15-18, 211727 tokens) and one section as test material (section 20, 47377 tokens)1,,
 The data contains words, their part-of-speech 1 This CITATION baseNP data set is available via ftp://ftp,,

 An alternative representation for baseNPs has been put forward by CITATION,,
 Tjong Kim Sang CITATION outlines alternative versions of this tagging representation,,
 Like the data used by CITATION, this data was retagged by the Brill tagger in order to obtain realistic part-of-speech (POS) tags5,,
 The data was segmented into baseNP parts and non-baseNP parts in a similar fashion as the data used by CITATION,,

 An alternative representation for baseNPs has been put forward by CITATION,,
 For the four IO representations we have used a second processing stage which used a smaller context but which included information about the IO tags predicted by the \x0crst processing phase (Tjong Kim CITATION),,
