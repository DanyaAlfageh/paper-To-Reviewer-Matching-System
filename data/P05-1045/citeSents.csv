2 Gibbs Sampling for Inference in Sequence Models In hidden state sequence models such as HMMs, CMMs, and CRFs, it is standard to use the Viterbi algorithm, a dynamic programming algorithm, to infer the most likely hidden state sequence given the input and the model (see, e.g., CITATION),,
 such algorithm is Gibbs sampling, a simple Monte Carlo algorithm that is appropriate for inference in any factored probabilistic model, including sequence models and probabilistic context free grammars CITATION,,
Statistical hidden state sequence models, such as Hidden Markov Models (HMMs) (CITATION; CITATION), Conditional Markov Models (CMMs) CITATION, and Conditional Random Fields (CRFs) CITATION are a prominent recent approach to information extraction tasks,,

CITATION propose a solution to this problem: for each token, they define additional features taken from other occurrences of the same token in the document,,
The most relevant prior works are CITATION, who use a Relational Markov Network (RMN) CITATION to explicitly models long-distance dependencies, and CITATION, who introduce skip-chain CRFs, which maintain the underlying CRF sequence model (which (Bunescu and Mooney, 2004) lack) while adding skip edges between distant nodes,,

way that is consistent with the Markov Network literature (see CITATION): we create a linear chain of cliques, where each clique, c, represents the probabilistic relationship between an adjacent pair of states2 using a clique potential c, which is just a table containing a value for each possible state assignment,,
CITATION and CITATION incorporate label consistency information by using adhoc multi-stage labeling procedures that are effective but special-purpose,,
CITATION and CITATION condition the label of a token at a particular position on the label of the most recent previous instance of that same token in a prior sentence of the same document,,
