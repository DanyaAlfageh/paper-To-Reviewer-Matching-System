CITATION report minor improvements with linguistic features on a Chinese-English task, CITATION show some success in re-ranking noun phrases for German-English,,
An extended description of these experiments is in the JHU workshop report CITATION,,
874 \x0c6.5 Additional Experiments Factored translation models have also been used for the integration of CCG supertags CITATION, domain adaptation CITATION and for the improvement of English-Czech translation CITATION,,
6.4 Integrated Recasing To demonstrate the versatility of the factored translation model approach, consider the task of recasing (CITATION; CITATION),,
Structural problems have also been addressed by pre-processing: CITATION reorder the input to a sta,,
The goal of integrating syntactic information into the translation model has prompted many researchers to pursue tree-based transfer models (CITATION; CITATION; CITATION; CITATION; CITATION; CITATION), with increasingly encouraging results,,
g and Kirchhoff, 2006; CITATION) by keeping a more complex representation throughout the translation process,,
Structural problems have also been addressed by pre-processing: CITATION reorder the input to a statistical system to closer match the word order of the output language,,
ent work on models that back off to representations with richer statistics (CITATION; CITATION; CITATION) by keeping a more complex representation throughout the translation process,,
Our framework is more general and goes beyond recent work on models that back off to representations with richer statistics (CITATION; CITATION; CITATION) by keeping a more complex representation throughout the translation process,,
Generate surface forms given the lemma and linguistic factors Factored translation models build on the phrasebased approach CITATION that breaks up the translation of a sentence into the translation of small text chunks (so-called phrases),,
This work is implemented as part of the open source Moses1 system CITATION,,
German morphological analysis and POS tagging was done using LoPar Schmidt and Schulte im Walde (2000), English POS tagging was done with Brills tagger CITATION, followed by a simple lemmatizer based on tagging results,,
Structural problems have also been addressed by pre-processing: CITATION,,
For more on this experiment, see CITATION,,
If the input language is morphologically richer than the output language, it helps to stem or segment the input in a pre-processing step, before passing it on to the translation system (CITATION; CITATION),,
The feature weights i in the log-linear model are determined using a minimum error rate training method, typically Powells method CITATION,,
