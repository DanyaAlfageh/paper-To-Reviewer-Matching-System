There has also been a lot of work done in social media on target directed sentiment analysis (CITATION; CITATION; CITATION) which we incorporate for capturing users intentions,,
It stores positive and negative sentiment scores for every sense of the word present in the wordNet CITATION,,
CITATION devised a help desk specific tagging schema to capture the queries and build email structure in help desk emails,,
To extract the extended targets, we capture named entities (NE) from the Wikipedia page of the debate topic (fetched using jsoup java library) using the Stanford Named Entity Recognizer CITATION and sort them based on their page occurrence count,,
Probabilistic association learning of target-opinion pair and the debate topic was used by CITATION as an integer linear programming problem to classify posts stance,,
2 Related Work To classify posts stance in dual-sided debates, previous approaches have used probabilistic CITATION as well as machine learning techniques (CITATION; CITATION),,
First, pronoun referencing is resolved using the Stanford co-reference resolution system CITATION,,
Pure machine learning approaches CITATION have extracted lexical and contextual features of debate posts to classify their stance,,
It is easy to observe that personal opinions are important in ideological stance taking CITATION,,
abilistic association learning of target-opinion pair and the debate topic was used by CITATION as an integer linear programming problem to classify posts stance,,
CITATION uses the same intuition to split the debate posts in two partitions using a max-cut algorithm,,
Some approaches extensively used the dialogue structure to identify posts stance CITATION whereas others considered opinion expressions and their targets essential to capture sentiment in the posts towards debate topics (CITATION; CITATION),,
CITATION partitioned the debate posts based on the dialogue structure of the debate and assigned stance to a partitio,,
CITATION partitioned the debate posts based on the dialogue structure of the debate and assigned stance to a partition using lexical features of candidate posts,,
smallest discourse units, based on sentence ending markers and a few specific Penn Discourse Tree Bank (PDTB) CITATION discourse markers listed in Table 2,,
We also compared our approach with the (Arg+Sent) method proposed by CITATION,,
CITATION partitioned the debate posts based on the dialogu,,
To extract opinion expressions, Somasundaran and Wiebe (2009) used the Subjectivity lexicon and CITATION used the MPQA opinion corpus CITATION,,
Unigram systems are proved reliable in sentiment analysis (CITATION; CITATION),,
Discourse markers cues were used by Sood (2013) to prioritize the conversational sentences and by CITATION to identify users intentions in help desk emails,,
CITATION partitioned the debate posts based on the dialogue structure of the debate and assigned stance to a partition using lexical features of can,,
Somasundaran and Wiebe (2009) attached opinion expressions to all plausible sentence words whereas CITATION attached opinion expressions to the debate topic closest to them,,
In topic directed sentiment analysis, the sentiment score is calculated using dependency parses of utterances and the sentiment lexicon sentiWordNet CITATION,,
CITATION used verbal response modes to understand the client/therapist conversations,,
We can also conclude that the Unigram system achieves higher accuracies than the lexFeatures system, showing that what the user says is a better indicator of users intentions than his sentiments and thus confirming previous research results (CITATION; CITATION),,
