Query expansion methods in Information Retrieval are also prominent cases of smoothing that addresses the lexical mismatch between query and document (CITATION; CITATION; CITATION),,
In lexical semantics, smoothing is often achieved by backing 731 \x0coff from words to semantic classes, either adopted from a resource such as WordNet CITATION or induced from data (CITATION; CITATION; CITATION),,
 (CITATION; CITATION),,
Similarly, distributional features support generalization in Named Entity Recognition CITATION,,
CITATION build models of selectional preferences that include morphological features such as capitalization and the presence of digits,,
CITATION make use of morphology by building language models for stemming-based equivalence classes,,
