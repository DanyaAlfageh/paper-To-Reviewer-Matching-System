 Training and test data, and the Wordnet glosses, were parsed with Charniaks parser CITATION,,
 Then, we integrate the task-specific and the external training data with a multicomponent classifier that simplifies the system for hierarchical word sense disambiguation presented in CITATION,,
 The classifier consists of two components based on the averaged multiclass perceptron (CITATION; CITATION),,
 This is a simplification of the algorithm presented in CITATION,,
5% Overall the system has the following advantages over that of CITATION,,
 Then, we integrate the task-specific and the external training data with a multicomponent classifier that simplifies the system for hierarchical word sense disambiguation presented in CITATION,,
 The classifier consists of two components based on the averaged multiclass perceptron (CITATION; CITATION),,
 Here we used the averaged perceptron CITATION, where the weight matrix used to classify the test data is the average of all of the matrices posited during training, i,,
 Then, we integrate the task-specific and the external training data with a multicomponent classifier that simplifies the system for hierarchical word sense disambiguation presented in CITATION,,
 The classifier consists of two components based on the averaged multiclass perceptron (CITATION; CITATION),,
 The multiclass perceptron CITATION is an on-line learning algorithm which 4 This likely depends on the fact that the IDs encode the location in the hierarchy, even though we dont know how the IDs are generated,,
 1 Introduction One of the main difficulties in word sense classification tasks stems from the fact that word senses, such as Wordnets synsets CITATION, define very specific classes1,,
 2 Features We used a set of features similar to that which was extensively described and evaluated in CITATION,,
