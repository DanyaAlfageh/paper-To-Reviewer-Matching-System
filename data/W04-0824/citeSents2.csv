Then, we integrate the task-specific and the external training data with a multicomponent classifier that simplifies the system for hierarchical word sense disambiguation presented in CITATION,,
Here we used the averaged perceptron CITATION, where the weight matrix used to classify the test data is the average of all of the matrices posited during training, i.e., \x01 &gt; 4 1 &gt; 1*3254 \x01 * ,,
The classifier consists of two components based on the averaged multiclass perceptron (CITATION; CITATION),,
