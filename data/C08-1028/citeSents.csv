The appeal of CCG can be attributed to the existence of efficient parsing algorithms for it and the fact that it recognizes a mildly context-sensitive language class CITATION, a language class more powerful than the context free languages (CFLs) that has been argued to be necessary for natural language syntax,,
As in CITATION, proof structures correspond to a proof if the semantic term assigned to the sentence category is a well formed lambda term which includes all the terms assigned to the words of the sentence,,
grammar CITATION, allowing the semantic derivation to exactly parallel the syntactic derivation,,
Impressive results have been achieved culminating in the state-of-the-art parser of CITATION which has been used as the parser for the Pascal Rich Textual Entailment Challenge entry of CITATION,,
k and Curran (2004) which has been used as the parser for the Pascal Rich Textual Entailment Challenge entry of CITATION,,
have been introduced including, among others, the Lambek calculus CITATION and Combinatory Categorial Grammar (CCG) CITATION,,
See section 5 for their connection to the proof structures of CITATION,,
A large number of CG formalisms have been introduced including, among others, the Lambek calculus CITATION and Combinatory Categorial Grammar (CCG) CITATION,,
CITATION provided a graph representation and a dynamic programming algorithm for parsing in the Lambek calculus with product,,
First, the base case is computed by building the base ATG B and determining the set of surface variables by using the proof frames of CITATION,,
CITATION provided an algorithm for L2 which is not correct for L,,
The restriction to bounded order is not a significant restriction, due to the fact that categories in CCGbank1 CITATION, a CCG corpus, have a maximum order of 5 and an average order of 0.78 by token,,
The appeal of CCG can be attributed to the existence of efficient parsing algorithms for it and the fact that it recognizes a mildly context-sensitive language class CITATION, a language class more powerful than the context free langua,,
Impressive results have been achieved culminating in the state-of-the-art parser of CITATION which has been used as the parser for the Pascal Rich Textual Entailment Challenge e,,
The Lambek calculus provides an ideal contrast between CCG and CFGs by being a CG formalism like CCG but by recognizing the CFLs like CFGs CITATION,,
First, it is the foundation of all other non-associative variants of the Lambek calculus including the original Lambek calculus CITATION and the multi-modal Lambek calculus CITATION,,
The most prominent of these formalisms has been context free grammars (CFGs) but a collection of formalisms known as categorial grammar (CG) (CITATION; CITATION; CITATION) has received interest because of some significant advantages over CFGs,,
Proof structures correspond to proofs under certain conditions and our conditions will be based on the semantic term of the proof given to us by the Curry-Howard isomorphism for the Lambek calculus CITATION,,
Second, the calculus with product is NP-complete CITATION, while the sequent derivability in the product-free fragment is still unknown,,
