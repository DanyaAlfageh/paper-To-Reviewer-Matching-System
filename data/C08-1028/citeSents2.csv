A large number of CG formalisms have been introduced including, among others, the Lambek calculus CITATION and Combinatory Categorial Grammar (CCG) CITATION,,
The appeal of CCG can be attributed to the existence of efficient parsing algorithms for it and the fact that it recognizes a mildly context-sensitive language class CITATION, a language class more powerful than the context free languages (CFLs) that has been argued to be necessary for natural language syntax,,
Impressive results have been achieved culminating in the state-of-the-art parser of CITATION which has been used as the parser for the Pascal Rich Textual Entailment Challenge entry of CITATION,,
The Lambek calculus provides an ideal contrast between CCG and CFGs by being a CG formalism like CCG but by recognizing the CFLs like CFGs CITATION,,
