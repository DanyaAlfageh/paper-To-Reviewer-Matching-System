3.2 Wall Street Journal Our out-of-domain data is the Wall Street Journal (WSJ) portion of the Penn Treebank CITATION which consists of about 40,000 sentences (one million words) annotated with syntactic information,,
We have already seen the results CITATION and CITATION achieve in Table 1,,
We use the same divisions as CITATION, who base their divisions on CITATION,,
3.1 Brown The BROWN corpus CITATION consists of many different genres of text, intended to approximate a balanced corpus,,
The BROWN parsing model is naturally better than the WSJ model for this task, but combining the two training corpora results in a better model (as in CITATION),,
We concentrate particularly on the work of (CITATION; CITATION) as they provide results which are directly comparable to those presented in this paper,,
However, the work which is most directly comparable to ours is that of (CITATION; CITATION; CITATION; CITATION),,
