 5 Seminar Extraction Task Dataset The CMU seminar announcement dataset CITATION includes 485 emails containing seminar announcements,,
2 We consider this corpus as an example of semi-structured text, where some of the field values appear in the email header, in a tabular structure, or using special formatting (CITATION; CITATION),,
, 2005; CITATION),,
 In order to increase recall further, additional candidates were extracted based on document structure CITATION,,
 Template filling is an IE task where the goal is to populate the fields of a target relation, for example to extract the attributes of a job posting CITATION or to recover the details of a corporate acquisition event from a news story CITATION,,
 For example, Figure 1 shows an extraction from CMU seminar announcement corpus CITATION,,
 In open IE, entities and relations may be inferred jointly (CITATION; CITATION),,
 In addition, extracted relations may be required to be consistent with an existing ontology CITATION,,
 Mainly, predetermined word-level dependencies were represented as links in the underlying graphical model (CITATION; Finkel et al,,
 Documents were pre-processed to extract noun phrases, similarly to CITATION,,
 Features We model syntactic features, following CITATION,,
 In order to compensate for parsing errors, shallow syntactic features were added, representing the values of neighboring verbs and prepositions CITATION,,
 We demonstrate empirically that these challenges can be solved with a combination of greedy beam decoding, performed directly in the joint space of possible mention clusters and field assignments, and structured Perceptronstyle learning algorithm CITATION,,
 We report experimental evaluations on two benchmark datasets in different genres, the CMU seminar announcements and corporate acquisitions CITATION,,
2 Learning We employ a discriminative learning algorithm, following CITATION,,
 Following Collins, we employ the averaged Perceptron online algorithm (CITATION; CITATION) for weight learning,,
3 Beam Search Unfortunately, optimal local decoding algorithms (such as the Viterbi algorithm in tagging problems CITATION) can not be applied to our problem,,

 Typically, these values are extracted based on local evidence, where the most likely entity is assigned to each slot (CITATION; CITATION),,

 Table 4 shows results of our full model in terms of field-level F1, compared against TIE, a state-of-theart discriminative system CITATION,,
 Unfortunately, we can not directly compare against a generative joint model evaluated on this dataset CITATION,,
