Next, we tried instance bagging CITATION to generate some diversity among parsers,,
We used the second order two stage parser and edge labeler of CITATION, which achieved top results in the 2006 CoNLL-X shared task,,
We were given around 15K sentences of labeled text from the Wall Street Journal (WSJ) (CITATION; CITATION) as well as 200K unlabeled sentences,,
Recent theoretical work on domain adaptation CITATION attributes adaptation loss to two sources: the difference in the distribution between domains and the difference in labeling functions,,
The annotation guidelines for the Penn Treebank flattened noun phrases to simplify annotation CITATION, so there is no complex structure to NPs,,
To address conflicting annota1053 \x0ctions, we added slack variables to the MIRA learning algorithm CITATION used to train the parsers, without success,,
CITATION showed that it is difficult to compare the Penn Treebank to other treebanks with more complex noun structures, such as BIO,,
We used the second order two stage parser and edge labeler of CITATION, which achieved top results in the 2,,
We constructed a feature representation of words based on adjacent POS and words and clustered words using an algorithm similar to that of CITATION,,
This paper outlines our participation in the 2007 CoNLL Shared Task on Domain Adaptation CITATION,,
The two test domains were a collection of medline chemistry abstracts (pchem, the CYP portion of the Penn Biomedical Treebank) and the Child Language Data Exchange System corpus (CHILDES) (CITATION; CITATION),,
The development data was 200 sentences of labeled biomedical oncology text (BIO, the ONCO portion of the Penn Biomedical Treebank), as well as 200K unlabeled sentences CITATION,,
ext from the Wall Street Journal (WSJ) (CITATION; CITATION) as well as 200K unlabeled sentences,,
