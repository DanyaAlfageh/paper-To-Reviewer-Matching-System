CITATION argue a logical next step for the research community would be to direct efforts towards increasing the size of annotated training collections,,
2) CITATION measure the frequency of the candidates in all the 3-to-5- gram patterns that span the confusable word,,
The dependency model (CITATIONa) compares one-two vs,,
CITATIONa) use simpler features, e.g,,
1 Introduction Many NLP systems use web-scale N-gram counts (CITATION; CITATION; CITATION),,
N-GM + LEX is highest on Medline, and close to the 88% human agreement CITATION,,
CITATION demonstrate good performance on eight tasks using unsupervised web-based models,,
While many approaches have adapted NLP systems to specific domains (CITATION; CITATION; Blitzer 865 \x0cet al., 2007; Daume III, 2007; CITATION), these techniques assume the system knows on which domain it is being used, and that it has access to representative data in that domain,,
examples from the Brown portion of the Treebank and 6296 examples from tagged Medline abstracts in the PennBioIE corpus CITATION,,
The examples can also be regarded as rank constraints in a discriminative ranker CITATION,,
CITATIONb) use comparable features to ours, but do not test out-of-domain,,
edline CITATION,,
While previous work has combined web-scale features with other features in specific classification problems (CITATION; CITATION; CITATIONb), we provide a multi-task, multi-domain comparison,,

CITATION propose unsupervised and supervised systems that use counts from Googles N-gram corpus CITATION,,
Following the set-up of CITATION, we experiment on the 263K adjective pairs Malouf extracted from the British National Corpus (BNC),,
Following CITATION, we get N-gram counts using the original Google N-gram Corpus,,
3.1.2 N-GM features CITATION propose a web-based approach to adjective ordering: take the most867 \x0cSystem IN O1 O2 CITATION 91.5 65.6 71.6 web c(a1, a2) vs,,
Counts from any large auxiliary corpus may also help, but web counts should help more CITATION,,
Each classifier is a linear Support Vector Machine (SVM), trained using LIBLINEAR CITATION on the standard domain,,
As in-domain data, we use CITATIONa)s Wall-Street Journal (WSJ) data, an extension of the Treebank (which originally left NPs flat),,
5 Noun Compound Bracketing About 70% of web queries are noun phrases CITATION and methods that can reliably parse these phrases are of great interest in NLP,,
as automatically tagged with TnT CITATION, using the Penn Treebank tag set,,
869 \x0cThis is 2% higher than the best unsupervised approach CITATION,,
Adjective ordering is also needed in Natural Language Generation systems that produce information from databases; for example, to convey information (in sentences) about medical patients CITATION,,
CITATION reach a similar conclusion,,
 to convey information (in sentences) about medical patients CITATION,,
Our web-based N-GM model is also superior to the direct evidence web-based approach of CITATION, scoring 90.0% vs,,
While exploiting transitivity has been shown to improve adjective ordering, there are many conflicting pairs that make a strict linear ordering of adjectives impossible CITATION,,
 We extract nouns followed by a VBN/VBD in the WSJ portion of the Treebank CITATION, getting 23K training, 1091 development and 1130 test examples from sections 2-22, 24, and 23, respectively,,
The adjacency model CITATION proposes a left bracketing if the association between words one and two is higher than between two and three,,
SVM and CITATION trained on BNC, tested on BNC (IN), Gutenberg (O1), and Medline (O2),,
While other ordering models have also achieved very poor results out-of-domain CITATION, we expected our expanded set of LEX features to provide good generalization on new data,,
As out-of-domain data, we use 244 NCs from Grolier Encyclopedia (CITATIONa) and 429 NCs from Medline CITATION,,
The source data was automatically tagged with TnT CITATION, using the Penn Treebank tag set,,
For example, parsers trained on annotated newspaper text perform poorly on other genres CITATION,,
Contextual spell checkers are one of the most widely used NLP technologies, reaching millions of users via compressed N-gram models in Microsoft Office CITATION,,
Our classifier thus operates along the lines of rankers in the preference-based setting as described in CITATION,,
This forms our in-domain data.3 We create out-of-domain examples by tokenizing Medline and Gutenberg (Section 2.2), then POS-tagging them with CRFTagger CITATION,,
Finally, we also have features for all suffixes of length 1-to-4 letters, as these encode useful information about adjective class CITATION,,
CITATION reach a similar conclusio,,
We have features for the words at all positions in a 9-word window (called collocation features by CITATION), plus indicators for a particular word preceding or following the confusable word,,
For N-GM count features, we follow CITATION,,
4 Like CITATION, we convert our pairs to lower-case,,
We test three unsupervised systems: 1) CITATION use one token of context on the left and one on the right, and output the ,,
Following CITATION, we also include counts of noun pairs collapsed into a single token; if a pair occurs often on the web as a single unit, it strongly indicates the pair is a constituent,,
They include the 5 confusion sets where accuracy was below 90% in CITATION,,
Early web-based models used search engines to collect N-gram counts, and thus could not use capitalization, punctuation, and annotations such as part-of-speech CITATION,,
Like CITATION, we assume that edited text has adjectives ordered fluently,,
Analogously to CITATION, we separately sum the log-counts for all contexts filled with VBD and then VBN, outputting the tag with the higher total,,
CITATION provide more details on the 1 http://webdocs.cs.ualberta.ca/bergsma/Robust/ provides our Gutenberg corpus, a link to Medline, and also the generated examples for both Gutenberg and Medline,,
CITATIONs system fares even worse,,
Characterizing a word by its distribution has a long history in NLP; we apply similar techniques to relations, like CITATION, but with a larger corpus and richer annotations,,
We extract nouns followed by a VBN/VBD in the WSJ portion of the Treebank CITATION, getting 23K training, 1091 development and 1130 test examples from sections 2-22, 24, and 23, respectively,,
Our in-domain examples are from the New York Times (NYT) portion of Gigaword, from CITATION,,
We test three unsupervised systems: 1) CITATION use one token of context on the left and one on the right, and output the candidate from the confusion set that occurs most frequently in this pattern,,
We trained and tested CITATIONs program on our data; our LEX classifier, which also uses no auxiliary corpus, makes 18% fewer errors than Maloufs system,,
2.3 Web-Scale Auxiliary Data The most widely-used N-gram corpus is the Google 5-gram Corpus CITATION,,
All web-based models (including the dependency model) exceed 81.5% on Grolier, which is the level of human agreement (CITATIONb),,
