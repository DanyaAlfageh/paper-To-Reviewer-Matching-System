The two models become distinct when there is a good supply of additional linguistic and world knowledge axiomsas in CITATION but not CITATION,,
Finally, a few efforts (CITATION; CITATION; CITATION) have tried to 42 \x0ctranslate sentences into formulas of first-order logic, in order to test logical entailment with a theorem prover,,

Participants in the first PASCAL RTE workshop reported accuracy from 49% to 59%, and CWS from 50.0% to 69.0% CITATION,,
We show comparable results from recent systems based on lexical similarity (Jijkoun and de Rijke, 2005), graph alignment CITATION, weighted abduction CITATION, and a mixed system including theorem proving CITATION,,
The best-known such work has occurred within the field of question answering (CITATION; CITATION); more recently, such work has continued with greater focus in addressing the PASCAL Recognizing Textual Entailment (RTE) Challenge CITATION and within the U.S,,
world knowledge is left unspecified.4 Despite the informality of the problem definition, human judges exhibit very good agreement on the RTE task, with agreement rate of 9196% CITATION,,
Participants in the first PASCAL RTE workshop reported accuracy from 49% to 59%, and CWS from 50.0% to 69.0% CITATION,,
A more structured approach is to formulate the entailment prediction as a graph matching problem (CITATION; de Salvo CITATION),,
We parse input sentences to phrase structure trees using the Stanford parser CITATION, a statistical syntactic parser trained on the Penn TreeBank,,
Named entities are identified by a CRF-based NER system, similar to that described in CITATION,,
After parsing, contiguous collocations which appear in WordNet CITATION are identified and grouped,,
In these rules, heads of constituents are first identified using a modified version of the Collins head rules that favor semantic heads (such as lexical verbs rather than auxiliaries), and dependents of heads are typed using tregex patterns CITATION, an extension of the tgrep pattern language,,

A third approach, exemplified by CITATION and CITATION, is to translate dependency parses into neo-Davidsonian-style quasilogical forms, and to perform weighted abductive theorem proving in the tradition of CITATION,,

The nodes in the final graph are then annotated with their associated word, part-of-speech (given by the parser), lemma (given by a finite-state transducer described by CITATION) and named-entity tag,,
Although developed independently, the same division between alignment and classification has also been proposed by CITATION, whose textual system is developed and evaluated on parallel translations into Dutch,,

In ID 152, we would like the hypothesis to align with the first part of the text, to 1 This is the same problem labeled and addressed as context in CITATION,,
