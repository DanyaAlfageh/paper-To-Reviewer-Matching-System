We show comparable results from recent systems based on lexical similarity (Jijkoun and de Rijke, 2005), graph alignment CITATION, weighted abduction CITATION, and a mixed system including theorem proving CITATION,,
The two models become distinct when there is a good supply of additional linguistic and world knowledge axiomsas in CITATION but not CITATION,,
Finally, a few efforts (CITATION; CITATION; CITATION) have tried to 42 \x0ctranslate sentences into formulas of first-order logic, in order to test logical entailment with a theorem prover,,
Participants in the first PASCAL RTE workshop reported accuracy from 49% to 59%, and CWS from 50.0% to 69.0% CITATION,,
