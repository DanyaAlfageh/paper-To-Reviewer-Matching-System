The annotation procedure is dependent on locating the head daughter, for which the scheme of CITATION with some changes and amendments is used,,
In contrast, the system of CITATION distinguishes 163 verbal subcategorisation classes by means of a statistical shallow parser, a classifier of subcategorisation classes, and a priori estimates of the probability that any verb will be a member of those classes,,
CITATION observes that Brents recognition technique is a rather simplistic and inadequate approach to verb detection, with a very high error rate,,
In order to examine the coverage of the extracted lexicon in a manner similar to CITATION, CITATION compared the reference lexicon acquired from Sections 02-21 with a test lexicon extracted from Section 23 of the WSJ,,
CITATION and CITATION extract lexicalised TAGs from the Penn Treebank,,
CITATION and (Chen and Vijay-Sh,,
CITATION use a hand-written head-lexicalised context-free grammar and a text corpus to compute the pro,,
Both techniques implement variations on the approaches of CITATION and CITATION for the purpose of differentiating between complement and adjunct,,
In order to examine the coverage of the extracted lexicon in a manner similar to CITATION, CITATION ,,
More recent work by CITATION on the filtering phase of this approach has improv,,
In Section 5 we evaluate the complete extracted lexicon against the COMLEX resource CITATION,,
CITATION use a hand-written head-lexicalised context-free grammar and a text corpus to compute the probability of particular subcategorisation scenarios,,
In order to examine the coverage of the extracted lexicon in a manner similar to CITATION, CITATION compared the referen,,
CITATION relies on local morphosyntactic cues,,
One of these, (Schulte im CITATION), induces a computational subcategorisation lexicon for over 14,000 German verbs,,
In this paper we present an approach to automating subcategorisation frame acquisition for LFG CITATION i.e,,
CITATION relies on local morphosyntactic cues (such as the -ing suffix, except where such a word follows a determiner or a preposition other than to) in the untagged Brown Corpus as probabilistic indicators of six different predefined subcategorisation frames,,
CITATION introduce a tool which uses fine-grained rules to identify the arguments, including optional arguments, of each verb occurrence in the Penn Treebank, along with their syntactic functions,,
5 COMLEX Evaluation We evaluated our induced (verbal) semantic forms against COMLEX CITATION,,
As COMLEX does not provide explicit passive entries, we applied Lexical Redundancy Rules CITATION to automatically convert the active COMLEX frames to their passive counterparts,,
 applied Lexical Redundancy Rules CITATION to automatically convert the active COMLEX frames to their passive counterparts,,
CITATION observe that in the work of CITATION, CITATION and CITATION, the maximum number of distinct subcategorization classes recognized is sixteen, and only Ushioda et al,,
Our Precision figures are again high (in comparison to 65.52% as recorded by (Schulte im CITATION)),,
ndancy Rules CITATION to automatically convert the active COMLEX frames to their passive counterparts,,
CITATION introduce a tool which use,,
More recent work by CITATION on the f,,
CITATION run a finite state NP parser on a POS-tagged,,
The only evaluation of a similar scale is that carried out by (Schulte im CITATION) for German,,
We also examined the coverage of our system in a similar way to CITATION,,
CITATION and CITATION observed that treebank grammars (CFGs extracted from treebanks) are very large and grow with the size of the treebank,,
We carried out the evaluation in a similar way to (Schulte im CITATION),,
CITATION run a finite state NP parser on a POS-tagged corpus to calculate the relative frequency of just six subcategorisation verb classes,,
gainst the COMLEX resource CITATION,,
CITATION and CITATION observed that tree,,
iscoe and Carroll, 1997) observe that in the work of CITATION, CITATION and CITATION, the maximum number of distinct subcategorization classes recognized is sixteen, and only Ushioda et al,,
CITATION outline a method for the automatic extraction of a large syntactic CCG lexicon from Penn-II,,
It is a well-documented fact CITATION that subcategorisation frames (and their frequencies) vary across domains,,
In the case of CITATION, invalid elementary trees produced as a result of annotation errors in the treebank are filtered out using linguistic heuristics,,
More recent work by CITATION on the filtering phase of this approach has improved results,,
