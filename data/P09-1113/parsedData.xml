Modern models of relation extraction for tasks like
ACE are based on supervised learning of relations
from small hand-labeled corpora. We investigate an
alternative paradigm that does not require labeled
corpora, avoiding the domain dependence of ACE-
style algorithms, and allowing the use of corpora
of any size. Our experiments use Freebase, a large
semantic database of several thousand relations, to
provide distant supervision. For each pair of enti-
ties that appears in some Freebase relation, we find
all sentences containing those entities in a large un-
labeled corpus and extract textual features to train
a relation classifier. Our algorithm combines the
advantages of supervised IE (combining 400,000
noisy pattern features in a probabilistic classifier)
and unsupervised IE (extracting large numbers of
relations from large corpora of any domain). Our
model is able to extract 10,000 instances of 102 re-
lations at a precision of 67.6%. We also analyze
feature performance, showing that syntactic parse
features are particularly helpful for relations that are
ambiguous or lexically distant in their expression.

1 Introduction
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.992117410714286">
At least three learning paradigms have been ap-
plied to the task of extracting relational facts from
text (for example, learning that a person is em-
ployed by a particular organization, or that a ge-
ographic entity is located in a particular region).
In supervised approaches, sentences in a cor-
pus are first hand-labeled for the presence of en-
tities and the relations between them. The NIST
Automatic Content Extraction (ACE) RDC 2003
and 2004 corpora, for example, include over 1,000
documents in which pairs of entities have been la-
beled with 5 to 7 major relation types and 23 to
24 subrelations, totaling 16,771 relation instances.
ACE systems then extract a wide variety of lexi-
cal, syntactic, and semantic features, and use su-
pervised classifiers to label the relation mention
holding between a given pair of entities in a test
set sentence, optionally combining relation men-
tions (Zhou et al., 2005; Zhou et al., 2007; Sur-
deanu and Ciaramita, 2007).
Supervised relation extraction suffers from a
number of problems, however. Labeled training
data is expensive to produce and thus limited in
quantity. Also, because the relations are labeled
on a particular corpus, the resulting classifiers tend
to be biased toward that text domain.
An alternative approach, purely unsupervised
information extraction, extracts strings of words
between entities in large amounts of text, and
clusters and simplifies these word strings to pro-
duce relation-strings (Shinyama and Sekine, 2006;
Banko et al., 2007). Unsupervised approaches can
use very large amounts of data and extract very
large numbers of relations, but the resulting rela-
tions may not be easy to map to relations needed
for a particular knowledge base.
A third approach has been to use a very small
number of seed instances or patterns to do boot-
strap learning (Brin, 1998; Riloff and Jones, 1999;
Agichtein and Gravano, 2000; Ravichandran and
Hovy, 2002; Etzioni et al., 2005; Pennacchiotti
and Pantel, 2006; Bunescu and Mooney, 2007;
Rozenfeld and Feldman, 2008). These seeds are
used with a large corpus to extract a new set of
patterns, which are used to extract more instances,
which are used to extract more patterns, in an it-
erative fashion. The resulting patterns often suffer
from low precision and semantic drift.
We propose an alternative paradigm, distant su-
pervision, that combines some of the advantages
of each of these approaches. Distant supervision
is an extension of the paradigm used by Snow et
al. (2005) for exploiting WordNet to extract hyper-
nym (is-a) relations between entities, and is simi-
lar to the use of weakly labeled data in bioinfor-
matics (Craven and Kumlien, 1999; Morgan et al.,

2004). Our algorithm uses Freebase (Bollacker et
al., 2008), a large semantic database, to provide
distant supervision for relation extraction. Free-
base contains 116 million instances of 7,300 rela-
tions between 9 million entities. The intuition of
distant supervision is that any sentence that con-
tains a pair of entities that participate in a known
Freebase relation is likely to express that relation
in some way. Since there may be many sentences
containing a given entity pair, we can extract very
large numbers of (potentially noisy) features that
are combined in a logistic regression classifier.
Thus whereas the supervised training paradigm
uses a small labeled corpus of only 17,000 rela-
tion instances as training data, our algorithm can
use much larger amounts of data: more text, more
relations, and more instances. We use 1.2 million
Wikipedia articles and 1.8 million instances of 102
relations connecting 940,000 entities. In addition,
combining vast numbers of features in a large clas-
sifier helps obviate problems with bad features.
Because our algorithm is supervised by a
database, rather than by labeled text, it does
not suffer from the problems of overfitting and
domain-dependence that plague supervised sys-
tems. Supervision by a database also means that,
unlike in unsupervised approaches, the output of
our classifier uses canonical names for relations.
Our paradigm offers a natural way of integrating
data from multiple sentences to decide if a relation
holds between two entities. Because our algorithm
can use large amounts of unlabeled data, a pair of
entities may occur multiple times in the test set.
For each pair of entities, we aggregate the features
from the many different sentences in which that
pair appeared into a single feature vector, allowing
us to provide our classifier with more information,
resulting in more accurate labels.
Table 1 shows examples of relation instances
extracted by our system. We also use this system
to investigate the value of syntactic versus lexi-
cal (word sequence) features in relation extraction.
While syntactic features are known to improve the
performance of supervised IE, at least using clean
hand-labeled ACE data (Zhou et al., 2007; Zhou
et al., 2005), we do not know whether syntactic
features can improve the performance of unsuper-
vised or distantly supervised IE. Most previous
research in bootstrapping or unsupervised IE has
used only simple lexical features, thereby avoid-
ing the computational expense of parsing (Brin,
1998; Agichtein and Gravano, 2000; Etzioni et al.,
2005), and the few systems that have used unsu-
pervised IE have not compared the performance
of these two types of feature.

Except for the unsupervised algorithms discussed
above, previous supervised or bootstrapping ap-
proaches to relation extraction have typically re-
lied on relatively small datasets, or on only a small
number of distinct relations. Approaches based on
WordNet have often only looked at the hypernym
(is-a) or meronym (part-of) relation (Girju et al.,
2003; Snow et al., 2005), while those based on the
ACE program (Doddington et al., 2004) have been
restricted in their evaluation to a small number of
relation instances and corpora of less than a mil-
lion words.
Many early algorithms for relation extraction
used little or no syntactic information. For ex-
ample, the DIPRE algorithm by Brin (1998) used
string-based regular expressions in order to rec-
ognize relations such as author-book, while the
SNOWBALL algorithm by Agichtein and Gravano
(2000) learned similar regular expression patterns
over words and named entity tags. Hearst (1992)
used a small number of regular expressions over
words and part-of-speech tags to find examples of
the hypernym relation. The use of these patterns
has been widely replicated in successful systems,
for example by Etzioni et al. (2005). Other work

such as Ravichandran and Hovy (2002) and Pan-
tel and Pennacchiotti (2006) use the same formal-
ism of learning regular expressions over words and
part-of-speech tags to discover patterns indicating
a variety of relations.
More recent approaches have used deeper syn-
tactic information derived from parses of the input
sentences, including work exploiting syntactic de-
pendencies by Lin and Pantel (2001) and Snow et
al. (2005), and work in the ACE paradigm such
as Zhou et al. (2005) and Zhou et al. (2007).
Perhaps most similar to our distant supervision
algorithm is the effective method of Wu and Weld
(2007) who extract relations from a Wikipedia
page by using supervision from the pages infobox.
Unlike their corpus-specific method, which is spe-
cific to a (single) Wikipedia page, our algorithm
allows us to extract evidence for a relation from
many different documents, and from any genre.

</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.998833379310345">
Following the literature, we use the term rela-
tion to refer to an ordered, binary relation be-
tween entities. We refer to individual ordered pairs
in this relation as relation instances. For ex-
ample, the person-nationality relation holds be-
tween the entities named John Steinbeck and
United States, so it has hJohn Steinbeck,
United Statesi as an instance.
We use relations and relation instances from
Freebase, a freely available online database of
structured semantic data. Data in Freebase is
collected from a variety of sources. One major
source is text boxes and other tabular data from
Wikipedia. Data is also taken from NNDB (bio-
graphical information), MusicBrainz (music), the
SEC (financial and corporate data), as well as di-
rect, wiki-style user editing. After some basic
processing of the July 2008 link export to con-
vert Freebases data representation into binary re-
lations, we have 116 million instances of 7,300
relations between 9 million entities. We next fil-
ter out nameless and uninteresting entities such as
user profiles and music tracks. Freebase also con-
tains the reverses of many of its relations (book-
author v. author-book), and these are merged. Fil-
tering and removing all but the largest relations
leaves us with 1.8 million instances of 102 rela-
tions connecting 940,000 entities. Examples are
shown in Table 2.

The intuition of our distant supervision approach
is to use Freebase to give us a training set of rela-
tions and entity pairs that participate in those rela-
tions. In the training step, all entities are identified

\x0cin sentences using a named entity tagger that la-
bels persons, organizations and locations. If a sen-
tence contains two entities and those entities are an
instance of one of our Freebase relations, features
are extracted from that sentence and are added to
the feature vector for the relation.
The distant supervision assumption is that if two
entities participate in a relation, any sentence that
contain those two entities might express that rela-
tion. Because any individual sentence may give
an incorrect cue, our algorithm trains a multiclass
logistic regression classifier, learning weights for
each noisy feature. In training, the features for
identical tuples (relation, entity1, entity2) from
different sentences are combined, creating a richer
feature vector.
In the testing step, entities are again identified
using the named entity tagger. This time, every
pair of entities appearing together in a sentence is
considered a potential relation instance, and when-
ever those entities appear together, features are ex-
tracted on the sentence and added to a feature vec-
tor for that entity pair. For example, if a pair of
entities occurs in 10 sentences in the test set, and
each sentence has 3 features extracted from it, the
entity pair will have 30 associated features. Each
entity pair in each sentence in the test corpus is run
through feature extraction, and the regression clas-
sifier predicts a relation name for each entity pair
based on the features from all of the sentences in
which it appeared.
Consider the location-contains relation, imag-
ining that in Freebase we had two instances of
this relation: hVirginia, Richmondi and
hFrance, Nantesi. As we encountered sen-
tences like Richmond, the capital of Virginia and
Henrys Edict of Nantes helped the Protestants of
France we would extract features from these sen-
tences. Some features would be very useful, such
as the features from the Richmond sentence, and
some would be less useful, like those from the
Nantes sentence. In testing, if we came across
a sentence like Vienna, the capital of Austria,
one or more of its features would match those of
the Richmond sentence, providing evidence that
hAustria, Viennai belongs to the location-
contains relation.
Note that one of the main advantages of our
architecture is its ability to combine informa-
tion from many different mentions of the same
relation. Consider the entity pair hSteven
Spielberg, Saving Private Ryani
from the following two sentences, as evidence for
the film-director relation.

<bodyText confidence="0.96250175">
The first sentence, while providing evidence for
film-director, could instead be evidence for film-

so could instead be evidence for the CEO relation

isolation, neither of these features is conclusive,

5 Features
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.998379">
Our features are based on standard lexical and syn-
tactic features from the literature. Each feature
describes how two entities are related in a sen-
tence, using either syntactic or non-syntactic in-
formation.
</bodyText>
<subsectionHeader confidence="0.982337">
5.1 Lexical features
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.980771428571429">
Our lexical features describe specific words be-
tween and surrounding the two entities in the sen-
tence in which they appear:
The sequence of words between the two entities
The part-of-speech tags of these words
A flag indicating which entity came first in the sentence
A window of k words to the left of Entity 1 and their
part-of-speech tags
A window of k words to the right of Entity 2 and their
part-of-speech tags
Each lexical feature consists of the conjunction of
all these components. We generate a conjunctive
feature for each k {0, 1, 2}. Thus each lexical
row in Table 3 represents a single lexical feature.
Part-of-speech tags were assigned by a max-
imum entropy tagger trained on the Penn Tree-
bank, and then simplified into seven categories:
nouns, verbs, adverbs, adjectives, numbers, for-
eign words, and everything else.
In an attempt to approximate syntactic features,
we also tested variations on our lexical features:

5.2 Syntactic features
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999188642857143">
In addition to lexical features we extract a num-
ber of features based on syntax. In order to gener-
ate these features we parse each sentence with the
broad-coverage dependency parser MINIPAR (Lin,
1998).
A dependency parse consists of a set of words
and chunks (e.g. Edwin Hubble, Missouri,
born), linked by directional dependencies (e.g.
pred, lex-mod), as in Figure 1. For each
sentence we extract a dependency path between
each pair of entities. A dependency path con-
sists of a series of dependencies, directions and
words/chunks representing a traversal of the parse.
Part-of-speech tags are not included in the depen-
dency path.
Our syntactic features are similar to those used
in Snow et al. (2005). They consist of the conjunc-
tion of:
A dependency path between the two entities
For each entity, one window node that is not part of
the dependency path
A window node is a node connected to one of the
two entities and not part of the dependency path.
We generate one conjunctive feature for each pair
of left and right window nodes, as well as features
which omit one or both of them. Thus each syn-
tactic row in Table 3 represents a single syntactic
feature.

5.3 Named entity tag features
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.997676">
Every feature contains, in addition to the content
described above, named entity tags for the two en-
tities. We perform named entity tagging using the
Stanford four-class named entity tagger (Finkel et
al., 2005). The tagger provides each word with a
label from {person, location, organization, miscel-
laneous, none}.

5.4 Feature conjunction
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999674714285714">
Rather than use each of the above features in the
classifier independently, we use only conjunctive
features. Each feature consists of the conjunc-
tion of several attributes of the sentence, plus the
named entity tags. For two features to match,
all of their conjuncts must match exactly. This
yields low-recall but high-precision features. With
a small amount of data, this approach would be
problematic, since most features would only be
seen once, rendering them useless to the classifier.
Since we use large amounts of data, even complex
features appear multiple times, allowing our high-
precision features to work as intended. Features
for a sample sentence are shown in Table 3.

We use Wikipedia because it is relatively up-

explicit many facts that might be omitted in
newswire. Much of the information in Freebase is
derived from tabular data from Wikipedia, mean-
ing that Freebase relations are more likely to ap-

For human evaluation experiments, all 1.8 mil-
lion relation instances are used in training. Again,
we use 800,000 Wikipedia articles in the training
phase and 400,000 different articles in the testing
phase.
For all our experiments, we only extract relation
instances that do not appear in our training data,
i.e., instances that are not already in Freebase.
Our system needs negative training data for the
purposes of constructing the classifier. Towards
this end, we build a feature vector in the train-
ing phase for an unrelated relation by randomly
selecting entity pairs that do not appear in any
Freebase relation and extracting features for them.
While it is possible that some of these entity pairs

features, and both) is reported at recall levels from 10 to 100,000. At the 100,000 recall level, we classify

the Freebase data, we expect that on average these
false negatives will have a small effect on the per-
formance of the classifier. For performance rea-
sons, we randomly sample 1% of such entity pairs
for use as negative training examples. By contrast,
in the actual test data, 98.7% of the entity pairs we
extract do not possess any of the top 102 relations
we consider in Freebase.
We use a multi-class logistic classifier opti-
mized using L-BFGS with Gaussian regulariza-
tion. Our classifier takes as input an entity pair
and a feature vector, and returns a relation name
and a confidence score based on the probability of
the entity pair belonging to that relation. Once all
of the entity pairs discovered during testing have
been classified, they can be ranked by confidence
score and used to generate a list of the n most
likely new relation instances.

We evaluate labels in two ways: automatically,
by holding out part of the Freebase relation data
during training, and comparing newly discovered
relation instances against this held-out data, and
manually, having humans who look at each posi-

Each predicted relation instance was labeled as
true or false by between 1 and 3 labelers on Me-
chanical Turk. We assigned the truth or falsehood
of each relation according to the majority vote of
the labels; in the case of a tie (one vote each way)
we assigned the relation as true or false with equal
probability. The evaluation of the syntactic, lexi-
cal, and combination of features at a recall of 100

At a recall of 100 instances, the combination of
lexical and syntactic features has the best perfor-

<bodyText confidence="0.999849363636364">
Our results show that the distant supervision algo-
rithm is able to extract high-precision patterns for
a reasonably large number of relations.
The held-out results in Figure 2 suggest that the
combination of syntactic and lexical features pro-
vides better performance than either feature set on
its own. In order to understand the role of syntactic
features, we examine Table 5, the human evalua-
tion of the most frequent 10 relations. For the top-
ranking 100 instances of each relation, most of the
best results use syntactic features, either alone or
in combination with lexical features. For the top-
ranking 1000 instances of each relation, the results
are more mixed, but syntactic features still helped
in most classifications.
We then examine those relations for which syn-
tactic features seem to help. For example, syn-
tactic features consistently outperform lexical fea-
tures for the director-film and writer-film relations.
As discussed in section 4, these two relations are
particularly ambiguous, suggesting that syntactic
features may help tease apart difficult relations.
Perhaps more telling, we noticed many examples
with a long string of words between the director
and the film:
Back Street is a 1932 film made by Univer-
sal Pictures, directed by John M. Stahl, and
produced by Carl Laemmle Jr.
Sentences like this have very long (and thus rare)
lexical features, but relatively short dependency
paths. Syntactic features can more easily abstract
from the syntactic modifiers that comprise the ex-
traneous parts of these strings.
Our results thus suggest that syntactic features
are indeed useful in distantly supervised informa-
tion extraction, and that the benefit of syntax oc-
curs in cases where the individual patterns are par-
ticularly ambiguous, and where they are nearby in
the dependency structure but distant in terms of
words. It remains for future work to see whether
simpler, chunk-based syntactic features might be
able to capture enough of this gain without the
overhead of full parsing, and whether coreference
resolution could improve performance.

<abstract confidence="0.999571608695652">Modern models of relation extraction for tasks like ACE are based on supervised learning of relations from small hand-labeled corpora. We investigate an alternative paradigm that does not require labeled corpora, avoiding the domain dependence of ACEstyle algorithms, and allowing the use of corpora of any size. Our experiments use Freebase, a large semantic database of several thousand relations, to provide distant supervision. For each pair of entities that appears in some Freebase relation, we find all sentences containing those entities in a large unlabeled corpus and extract textual features to train a relation classifier. Our algorithm combines the advantages of supervised IE (combining 400,000 noisy pattern features in a probabilistic classifier) and unsupervised IE (extracting large numbers of relations from large corpora of any domain). Our model is able to extract 10,000 instances of 102 relations at a precision of 67.6%. We also analyze feature performance, showing that syntactic parse features are particularly helpful for relations that are ambiguous or lexically distant in their expression.</abstract>

Most previous research in bootstrapping or unsupervised IE has used only simple lexical features, thereby avoiding the computational expense of parsing (Brin, 1998; Agichtein and Gravano, 2000; Etzioni et al., 2005), and the few systems that have used unsupervised IE have not compared the performance of these two types of feature. 2 Previous work Except for the unsupervised algorithms discussed above, previous supervised or bootstrapping approaches to relation extraction have typically relied on relatively small datasets, or on only a small number of distinct relations.

Most previous research in bootstrapping or unsupervised IE has used only simple lexical features, thereby avoiding the computational expense of parsing (Brin, 1998; Agichtein and Gravano, 2000; Etzioni et al., 2005), and the few systems that have used unsupervised IE have not compared the performance of these two types of feature. 2 Previous work Except for the unsupervised algorithms discussed above, previous supervised or bootstrapping approaches to relation extraction have typically relied on relatively small datasets, or on only a small number of distinct relations. Approaches based on WordNet have often only looked at the hypernym (is-a) or meronym (part-of) relation (Girju et al., 2003; Snow et al., 2005), while those based on the ACE program (Dod</context>

A third approach has been to use a very small number of seed instances or patterns to do bootstrap learning (Brin, 1998; Riloff and Jones, 1999; Agichtein and Gravano, 2000; Ravichandran and Hovy, 2002; Etzioni et al., 2005; Pennacchiotti and Pantel, 2006; Bunescu and Mooney, 2007; Rozenfeld and Feldman, 2008).

We generate one conjunctive feature for each pair of left and right window nodes, as well as features which omit one or both of them. Thus each syntactic row in Table 3 represents a single syntactic feature. 5.3 Named entity tag features Every feature contains, in addition to the content described above, named entity tags for the two entities. We perform named entity tagging using the Stanford four-class named entity tagger (Finkel et al., 2005). The tagger provides each word with a label from {person, location, organization, miscellaneous, none}. 5.4 Feature conjunction Rather than use each of the above features in the classifier independently, we use only conjunctive features. Each feature consists of the conjunction of several attributes of the sentence, plus the named entity tags. For two features to match, all of their conjuncts must match exactly. This yields low-recall but high-precision features. With a small amount of data, this approach would be problematic, since most features would only be seen once, rendering them useles</context>

In order to generate these features we parse each sentence with the broad-coverage dependency parser MINIPAR (Lin, 1998). A dependency parse consists of a set of words and chunks (e.g. Edwin Hubble, Missouri, born), linked by directional dependencies (e.g. pred, lex-mod), as in Figure 1. For each sentence we extract a dependency path between each pair of entities. A dependency path consists of a series of dependencies, directions and words/chunks representing a traversal of the parse. Part-of-speech tags are not included in the dependency path. Our syntactic features are similar to those used in Snow et al. (2005). They consist of the conjunction of: A dependency path between the two entities For each entity, o</context>

Approaches based on WordNet have often only looked at the hypernym (is-a) or meronym (part-of) relation (Girju et al., 2003; Snow et al., 2005), while those based on the ACE program (Doddington et al., 2004) have been restricted in their evaluation to a small number of relation instances and corpora of less than a million words. Many early algorithms for relation extraction used little or no syntactic information. For example, the DIPRE algorithm by Brin (1998) used string-based regular expressions in order to recognize relations such as author-book, while the SNOWBALL algorithm by Agichtein and Gravano (2000) learned similar regular expression patterns over words and named entity tags.

A dependency parse consists of a set of words and chunks (e.g. Edwin Hubble, Missouri, born), linked by directional dependencies (e.g. pred, lex-mod), as in Figure 1. For each sentence we extract a dependency path between each pair of entities. A dependency path consists of a series of dependencies, directions and words/chunks representing a traversal of the parse. Part-of-speech tags are not included in the dependency path. Our syntactic features are similar to those used in Snow et al. (2005). They consist of the conjunction of: A dependency path between the two entities For each entity, one window node that is not part of the dependency path A window node is a node connected to one of the two entities and not part of the dependency path. We generate one conjunctive feature for each pair of left and right window nodes, as well as features which omit one or both of them. Thus each syntactic row in Table 3 represents a single syntactic feature. 5.3 Named entity tag features Every feature contains, in addition to the content described above, named entity tags for the two entities.

Table 1 shows examples of relation instances extracted by our system. We also use this system to investigate the value of syntactic versus lexical (word sequence) features in relation extraction. While syntactic features are known to improve the performance of supervised IE, at least using clean hand-labeled ACE data (Zhou et al., 2007; Zhou et al., 2005), we do not know whether syntactic features can improve the performance of unsupervised or distantly supervised IE. Most previous research in bootstrapping or unsupervised IE has used only simple lexical features, thereby avoiding the computational expense of parsing (Brin, 1998; Agichtein and Gravano, 2000; Etzioni et al., 2005), and the few systems that have used unsupervised IE have not compared the performance of these two types of feature. 2 Previous work Except for the unsupervised algorithms discussed above, previous supervised or bootstrapping approaches to relation</context>

More recent approaches have used deeper syntactic information derived from parses of the input sentences, including work exploiting syntactic dependencies by Lin and Pantel (2001) and Snow et al. (2005), and work in the ACE paradigm such as Zhou et al. (2005) and Zhou et al. (2007). Perhaps most similar to our distant supervision algorithm is the effective method of Wu and Weld (2007) who extract relations from a Wikipedia page by using supervision from the pages infobox. Unlike their corpus-specific method, which is specific to a (single) Wikipedia page, our algorithm allows us to extract evidence for a relation from many different documents, and from any genre. 3 Freebase Following the literature, we use the term relation to refer to an ordered, binary relation between entities. We refer to individual ordered pairs in this relation as relation instances. For example, </context>
