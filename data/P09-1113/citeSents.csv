order to generate these features we parse each sentence with the broad-coverage dependency parser MINIPAR CITATION,,
Most previous research in bootstrapping or unsupervised IE has used only simple lexical features, thereby avoiding the computational expense of parsing (CITATION; CITATION; CITATION), and the few systems that have used unsupervised IE have not compared the performance of these two types of feature,,
