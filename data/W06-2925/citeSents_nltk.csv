The features used to score, while based on the previous work in dependency parsing CITATION, introduce some novel concepts such as better codification of context and surface distances, and runtime information from dependencies previously parsed,,
1 Introduction We describe a learning system for the CoNLL-X Shared Task on multilingual dependency parsing CITATION, for 13 different languages,,
