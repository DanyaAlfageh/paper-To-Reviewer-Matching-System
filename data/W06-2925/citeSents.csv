edu Abstract We describe an online learning dependency parser for the CoNLL-X Shared Task, based on the bottom-up projective algorithm of CITATION,,
 1 Introduction We describe a learning system for the CoNLL-X Shared Task on multilingual dependency parsing CITATION, for 13 different languages,,
 Our system is a bottom-up projective dependency parser, based on the cubic-time algorithm by CITATION; 2000),,
 The features used to score, while based on the previous work in dependency parsing CITATION, introduce some novel concepts such as better codification of context and surface distances, and runtime information ,,
3 Perceptron Learning As learning algorithm, we use Perceptron tailored for structured scenarios, proposed by CITATION,,
 partial parsing CITATION or even dependency parsing CITATION,,
 Most of these features are inspired by previous work in dependency parsing (CITATION; CITATION),,
