CITATION used simulated annealing with Gibbs sampling to find a solution in a similar situation,,
The optimal solution obtained by Equation (11) maximizes the probability of each POS tag given w, and this kind of approach is known as the maximum posterior marginal (MPM) estimate CITATION,,
We also conduct experiments using simulated annealing in decoding, as conducted by CITATION for information extraction,,
Global information is known to be useful in other NLP tasks, especially in the named entity recognition task, and several studies successfully used global features (CITATION; CITATION),,
