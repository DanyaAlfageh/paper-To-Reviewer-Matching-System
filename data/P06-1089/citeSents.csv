This issue was mentioned by CITATION as a problem of possibility-based POS tags,,
Local 3 A major method for generating such pseudo unknown words is to collect the words that appear only once in a corpus CITATION,,
These words are called hapax legomena and known to have similar characteristics to real unknown words CITATION,,
p0(t|w) is calculated by ME models as follows CITATION: p0(t|w)= 1 Y (w) exp ( H X h=1 hgh(w, t) ) , (20) 709 \x0cLanguage Features English Prefixes of 0 up to four characters, suffixes of 0 up to four characters, 0 contains Arabic numerals, 0 contains uppercase characters, 0 contains hyphens,,
(17) We use Gaussian priors CITATION for P(): log P()= N X i=1 N X j=1 2 i,j 22 + C, i,j log P() = i,j 2 ,,
The optimal can be obtained by quasi-Newton methods using the above L and L i,j , and we use L-BFGS CITATION for this purpose2,,
To cope with the problem, we use the sampling technique again for the calculation, as suggested by CITATION,,
There have been many studies on POS guessing of unknown words (CITATION; CITATION; CITATION; CITATION; CITATION),,
Global information is known to be useful in other NLP tasks, especially in the named entity recognition task, and several studies successfully used global features (CITATION; CITATION),,
CITATION conducted named entity recognition using global features as well as local features,,
CITATION proposed a method incorporating non-local structure for information extraction,,

The optimal solution obtained by Equation (11) maximizes the probability of each POS tag given w, and this kind of approach is known as the maximum posterior marginal (MPM) estimate CITATION,,
CITATION used simulated annealing with Gibbs sampling to find a solution in a similar situation,,
We also conduct experiments using simulated annealing in decoding, as conducted by CITATION for information extraction,,
CITATION proposed a method incorporating non-local structure for information extraction,,
Then the final model was constructed by multiplying these two models, which can be seen as unnormalized log-linear interpolation CITATION of the two models which are weighted equally,,

CITATION studied a method for word sense disambiguation using unlabeled data,,
CITATION proposed whole-sentence exponential language models,,
(2) CITATION applied this model to an NLP task, semantic orientation extraction, and we apply it to POS guessing of unknown words here,,
CITATION proposed a method based on the spin models in physics for extracting semantic orientations of words,,
The features we use are shown in Table 2, which are based on the features used by CITATION and CITATION,,
Although HMMs, MEMMs, and CRFs use dynamic programming and some studies with probabilistic models which have specific structures use efficient algorithms CITATION, such methods cannot be applied here because we are considering interactions (dependencies) between all POS tags, and their joint distribution cannot be decomposed,,
