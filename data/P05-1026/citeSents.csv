In order to solve the problem of finding relevant documents for each subtopic, we considered four different approaches: Approach 1: All documents in the CNS collection were initially clustered using K-Nearest Neighbor (KNN) clustering CITATION,,
Approach 2: Since individual documents may contain discourse segments pertaining to different sub-topics, we first used TextTiling CITATION to automatically segment all of the documents in the CNS collection into individual text tiles,,
QUAB questions are clustered based on their mapping to a vector of important concepts in the QUAB.The clustering was done using the K-Nearest Neighbor (KNN) method CITATION,,
If a large database of topic-relevant questions were available for a wide variety of topics, the accuracy of a state-of-the-art Q/A system such as CITATION could be enhanced,,
Although structural relations and definition relations are discovered reliably using patterns available from our Q/A system CITATION, we found only extraction relations to be useful in determining the set of documents relevant to a subtopic,,
The notion of topic signatures was first introduced in CITATION,,
Later work by CITATION demonstrated that topic signatures can be further enhanced by discovering the most relevant relations that exist between pairs of concepts,,
 discourse segments pertaining to different sub-topics, we first used TextTiling CITATION to automatically segment all of the documents in the CNS collection into individual text tiles,,
(Seed relations were created both by hand and using the method presented in CITATION.) Since seed relations are by definition relevant to a particular subtopic, they can be used to determine a binary partition of the document collection \x04 into (1) a relevant set of documents \x05\x06\x01 (that is, the documents relevant to relation \x01 ) and (2) a set of non-relevant documents \x04 -\x05\x06\x01 ,,
Inspired by the method presented in CITATION, a topic signature (as calculated by CITATION) is then produced for the set of documents in \x05\x07\x01 ,,
(Salience-based relations are discovered using a technique first reported in CITATION which approximates a Centering Theory-style approach CITATION to the resolution of coreference.) Subtopic: Egypts production of toxins and BW agents Topic Signature: produce phosphorous trichloride (TOXIN) house ORGANIZATION cultivate nonpathogenic Bacilus Subtilis (TOXIN) produce mycotoxins (TOXIN) acquire FACILITY Subtopic: Egypts allies and partners Topic Signature: provide COUNTRY cultivate COUNTRY supply precursors cooperate COUNTRY train PERSON supply knowhow Figure 3: Example of two topic signatures acquired for the scenario illustrated in Figure 2,,

The first four metrics were introduced in CITATION,,
As backoff only, we used a question type similarity based on a matrix akin to the one reported in CITATION Similarity Metric 5 is based on question concepts rather than question terms,,
when and (2) the relation between predicates, question stem and the words that determine the answer type (Narayanan and CITATION),,
The topic representation enables an Information Extraction module based on CITATION to find topic-relevant information in the document collection and to use it as answers for the QUABs,,
We use a semantic parser (described in CITATION) that recognizes predicate-argument structures,,
Problem 2: We have found that the identification of the association between a candidate answer and a question depends on (a) the recognition of predicates and entities based on both the output of a named entity recognizer and a semantic parser CITATION and their structuring into predicate-argument frames, (b) the resolution of reference (addressed in Problem 1), (c) the recognition of implicit relations between predications stated in the answer,,

Since seed relations are by definition relevant to a particular subtopic, they can be used to determine a binary partition of the document collection \x04 into (1) a relevant set of documents \x05\x06\x01 (that is, the documents relevant to relation \x01 ) and (2) a set of non-relevant documents \x04 -\x05\x06\x01 ,,
Inspired by the method presented in CITATION, a topic signature (as calculated by CITATION) is then produced for the set of documents in \x05\x07\x01 ,,
For each subtopic \x03 \x01 defined as part of the dialogue scenario, documents relevant to a corresponding seed relation \x01 are added to \x05 iff the relation \x08\x01 meets the density criterion (as defined in CITATION),,
Once extraction relations were obtained for a particular set of documents, the resulting set of relations were ranked according to a method proposed in CITATION,,
