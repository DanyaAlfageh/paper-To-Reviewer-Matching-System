3 Deep Semantic Analysis 3.1 Semantic Interpretation We use a robust wide-coverage CCG-parser CITATION to generate fine-grained semantic representations for each T/H-pair,,
The semantic representation language is a first-order fragment of the DRSlanguage used in Discourse Representation Theory CITATION, conveying argument structure with a neo-Davidsonian analysis and including the recursive DRS structure to cover negation, disjunction, and implication,,
To check whether an entailment holds or not, we use two kinds of automated reasoning tools: Vampire, a theorem prover CITATION, and Paradox, a model builder CITATION,,
We use the standard translation from DRS to firstorder logic CITATION to map our semantic representation onto the format required by the inference tools,,
For a more exhaustive description of dataset design we refer the reader to CITATION,,
Our evaluation measures are accuracy (acc) as the percentage of correct judgements as well as confidence-weighted average score (cws), which rewards the systems ability to assign a higher confidence score to correct judgements than wrong ones CITATION: after the n judgements are sorted in decreasing order by their confidence value, the following measure is computed: cws = 1 n n X i=1 #correct-up-rank-i i All evaluation measures are computed over the whole test set as well as on the 7 different subsets (CD, IE, etc.),,
