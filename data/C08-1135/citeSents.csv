CITATION describes a method of sentiment classification using two human-selected seed words (the words poor and excellent) in conjunction with a very large text corpus; the semantic orientation of phrases is computed as their association with the seed words (as measured by pointwise mutual information),,0
For example, CITATION experiment with the use of linguistic, statistical and n-gram features and measures for feature selection and weighting,,0
The higher prevalence of positive reviews has been observed previously: for example, in our corpus before we balanced it almost 80% of reviews were positive; CITATION constructed their move review corpus from an original dataset of 1301 positive and 752 negative reviews (63% positive),,1
However, CITATION showed that it is difficult to get good coverage of a target domain from manually selected words, and even simple corpus frequency counts may produce a better list of features for supervised classification: human-created lists resulted in 64% accuracy on a movie review corpus, while a list of frequent words scored 69%,,0
