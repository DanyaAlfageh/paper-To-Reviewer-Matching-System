Memory-based learning, in contrast, is &quot;lazy&quot;; learning is merely the storage of learning examples in memory, while the effort is deferred to the classification of new material, which in IB 1 essentially follows the k-nearest neighbor classification rule CITATION of searching for nearest neighbors in memory, and extrapolating their (majority) class to the new instance.,,

1 Introduction One of the factors determining the acceptability of synthetic speech is the appropriate placement of phrase boundaries, realized typically and most audibly by pauses CITATION.,,
Even if there is no one-to-one mapping between syntax and prosody, the placement of prosodic phrase boundaries is nevertheless dependent on syntactic information (CITATION; CITATION; van Herwijnen and Terken, 2001b).,,

Consequently, frequency counts obtained from the =Note that CITATION allow all combinations of one to four heads as features.,,
Recently, this reasoning was introduced in CITATION, a study in which the WWW was used to resolve PP attachment.,,
The first method is a replication of the study by CITATION.,,
Method I: cooccurrence NnearP or VnearP CITATION assumes that the higher value of Cooc(VnearP) and Cooc(NnearP) decides the attachment.,,
This is the threshold used by CITATION.,,
A typical current parser (e.g., statistical parsers such as (CITATION; CITATION; CITATION)) interleaves PP attachment with all its other disambiguation tasks.,,

It has been argued in the literature that high k and distance weighting is a sensible combination CITATION.,,
