Well known examples of such cooccurrence strength metrics are mutual information CITATION, chi-square and log likelihood CITATION,,
Method I: cooccurrence NnearP or VnearP CITATION assumes that the higher value of Cooc(VnearP) and Cooc(NnearP) decides the attachment,,
However, because of its interesting complexity, a line of work has concentrated on studying the task in isolation (CITATION; CITATION; CITATION; CITATION; CITATION; CITATION),,
mining the acceptability of synthetic speech is the appropriate placement of phrase boundaries, realized typically and most audibly by pauses CITATION,,
1 Introduction One of the factors determining the acceptability of synthetic speech is the appropriate placement of phrase boundaries, realized typically and most audibly by pauses CITATION,,

when placed, usually judged appropriate CITATION,,
To obtain a &quot;gold standard&quot; we manually classified all PPs into NOUN and VERB attachment, according to the &quot;single constituent test&quot; CITATION,,
140 \x0c3 Feature engineering 3.1 Lexical features Analogous to CITATION, we (manually) selected the four lexical heads of the phrases involved in the attachment as features,,
eats pizza with a fork, an intervening phrase boundary between the PP and its preceding NP or PP (between pizza and with) is optional, and when placed, usually judged appropriate CITATION,,
Memory-based learning, in contrast, is &quot;lazy&quot;; learning is merely the storage of learning examples in memory, while the effort is deferred to the classification of new material, which in IB 1 essentially follows the k-nearest neighbor classification rule CITATION of searching for nearest neighbors in memory, and extrapolating their (majority) class to the new instance,,
Even if there is no one-to-one mapping between syntax and prosody, the placement of prosodic phrase boundaries is nevertheless dependent on syntactic information (CITATION; CITATION; van Herwijnen and Terken, 2001b),,
ged appropriate CITATION,,
A typical current parser (e.g., statistical parsers such as (CITATION; CITATION; CITATION)) interleaves PP attachment with all its other disambiguation tasks,,
In line with the case study for English introduced in CITATION, we collect a training set of Dutch PP attachment instances from a syntactic treebank,,
The first method is a replication of the study by CITATION,,
However, because of its interesting complexity, a line of work has concentrated on studying the task in isolation (CITATION; CITATION; Brill and ,,
ptability of synthetic speech is the appropriate placement of phrase boundaries, realized typically and most audibly by pauses CITATION,,
Recently, this reasoning was introduced in CITATION, a study in which the WWW was used to resolve PP attachment,,
Consequently, frequency counts obtained from the =Note that CITATION allow all combinations of one to four heads as features,,
It has been argued in the literature that high k and distance weighting is a sensible combination CITATION,,
This is the threshold used by CITATION,,
