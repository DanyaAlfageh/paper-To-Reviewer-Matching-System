On one end, we have extractors that process text on a per sentence basis (CITATION; CITATION),,
Note that to construct this graphical model we use FACTORIE CITATION, a probabilistic programming language that simplifies the con,,
The feature functions of this template are taken from (CITATIONb) (with minor modifications),,
In order to scale up, we run an efficient Gibbs-Sampler at inference time, and train our model using SampleRank CITATION,,
First we follow CITATION, use Freebase as source of distant supervision, and employ Wikipedia as source of unlabelled textwe will call this an in-domain setting,,
CITATION refer to this as the distant supervision assumption,,
The feature functions of this template are taken from CITATION,,
We will follow CITATION and call the term R (c1, ,,
This allows the learner to acquire more supervision per instance, and has led to efficient training for models in which inference 1017 \x0cis expensive and generally intractable CITATION,,
place of annotated text, only an existing knowledge base (KB) is needed to train a relation extractor (CITATION; CITATION; CITATION),,
However, in contrast to these previous approaches, and other related distant supervision methods (CITATION; CITATION; CITATION), we perform relation extraction collectively with entity type prediction,,
Our work is inspired by CITATION who also use Freebase as distant supervision source,,
On the other end, we have methods that take relation mentions from several documents and use these as input features (CITATION; CITATION),,
We also heuristically align our knowledge base to text by making the distant supervision assumption (CITATION; CITATION),,
5.1.1 Data preprocessing We preprocess our textual data as follows: We first use the Stanford named entity recognizer CITATION to find entity mentions in the corpus,,
One heuristic is to assume that each candidate mention tuple of a training fact is indeed expressing the corresponding relation CITATION,,
On inspection, we find that these preferences are often not satisfied in a baseline distant supervision system akin to CITATION,,
