We present a novel approach to relation ex-
traction that integrates information across doc-
uments, performs global inference and re-
quires no labelled text. In particular, we
tackle relation extraction and entity identifi-
cation jointly. We use distant supervision to
train a factor graph model for relation ex-
traction based on an existing knowledge base
(Freebase, derived in parts from Wikipedia).
For inference we run an efficient Gibbs sam-
pler that leads to linear time joint inference.
We evaluate our approach both for an in-
domain (Wikipedia) and a more realistic out-
of-domain (New York Times Corpus) setting.
For the in-domain setting, our joint model
leads to 4% higher precision than an isolated
local approach, but has no advantage over a
pipeline. For the out-of-domain data, we ben-
efit strongly from joint modelling, and observe
improvements in precision of 13% over the
pipeline, and 15% over the isolated baseline.

1 Introduction

<bodyText confidence="0.995525636363636">
Relation Extraction is the task of predicting seman-
tic relations over entities expressed in structured or
semi-structured text. This includes, for example,
the extraction of employer-employee relations men-
tioned in newswire, or protein-protein interactions
expressed in biomedical papers. It also includes the
prediction of entity types such as country, citytown
or person, if we consider entity types as unary rela-
tions.
A particularly attractive approach to relation ex-
traction is based on distant supervision.1 Here in

Also called self training, or weak supervision.
place of annotated text, only an existing knowl-
edge base (KB) is needed to train a relation extrac-
tor (Mintz et al., 2009; Bunescu and Mooney, 2007;
Riedel et al., 2010). The facts in the KB are heuris-
tically aligned to an unlabelled training corpus, and
the resulting alignment is the basis for learning the
extractor.
Naturally, the predictions of a distantly supervised
relation extractor will be less accurate than those of
a supervised one. While facts of existing knowledge
bases are inexpensive to come by, the heuristic align-
ment to text will often lead to noisy patterns in learn-
ing. When applied to unseen text, these patterns will
produce noisy facts. Indeed, we find that extraction
precision still leaves much room for improvement.
This room is not as large as in previous work (Mintz
et al., 2009) where target text and training KB are
closely related. However, when we use the knowl-
edge base Freebase (Bollacker et al., 2008) and the
New York Times corpus (Sandhaus, 2008), we ob-
serve very low precision. For example, the preci-
sion of the top-ranked 50 nationality relation
instances is only 28%.
On inspection, it turns out that many of the errors
can be easily identified: they amount to violations
of basic compatibility constraints between facts. In
particular, we observe unsatisfied selectional pref-
erences of relations towards particular entity types
as types of their arguments. An example is the fact
that the first argument of nationality is always
a person while the second is a country. A sim-
ple way to address this is a pipeline: first predict
entity types, and then condition on these when pre-
dicting relations. However, this neglects the fact that
relations could as well be used to help entity type
prediction.

<bodyText confidence="0.999081177777778">
\x0cWhile there is some existing work on enforcing
such constraints in a joint fashion (Roth and Yih,
2007; Kate and Mooney, 2010; Riedel et al., 2009),
they are not directly applicable here. The difference
is the amount of facts they take into account at the
same time. They focus on single sentence extrac-
tions, and only consider very few interacting facts.
This allows them to work with exact optimization
techniques such as (Integer) Linear Programs and
still remain efficient.2 However, when working on
a sentence level they fail to exploit the redundancy
present in a corpus. Moreover, the fewer facts they
consider at the same time, the lower the chance that
some of these will be incompatible, and that mod-
elling compatibility will make a difference.
In this work we present a novel approach that
performs relation extraction across documents, en-
forces selectional preferences, and needs no labelled
data. It is based on an undirected graphical model
in which variables correspond to facts, and factors
between them measure compatibility. In order to
scale up, we run an efficient Gibbs-Sampler at in-
ference time, and train our model using SampleR-
ank (Wick et al., 2009). In practice this leads to a
runtime behaviour that is linear in the size of the cor-
pus. For example, 200,000 documents take less than
three hours for training and testing.
For evaluation we consider two scenarios. First
we follow Mintz et al. (2009), use Freebase as
source of distant supervision, and employ Wikipedia
as source of unlabelled textwe will call this an
in-domain setting. This scenario is somewhat arti-
ficial in that Freebase itself is partially derived from
Wikipedia, and in practice we cannot expect text and
training knowledge base to be so close. Hence we
also evaluate our approach on the New York Times
corpus (out-of-domain setting).
For in-domain data we make the following find-
ing. When we compare to an isolated baseline that
makes no use of entity types, our joint model im-
proves average precision by 4%. However, it does
not outperform a pipelined system. In the out-of-
domain setting, our collective model substantially
outperforms both other approaches. Compared to
the isolated baseline, we achieve a 15% increase in

2 Background
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.99980625">
In this section we will introduce the terminology and
concepts we use throughout the paper. We will also
give a brief introduction to relation extraction, in
particular in the context of distant supervision.
</bodyText>
<subsectionHeader confidence="0.840707">
2.1 Relations
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.981893714285714">
We seek to extract facts about entities. Example en-
tities would be the company founder BILL GATES,
the company MICROSOFT, and the country USA.
A relation R is a set of tuples c over entities. We
will follow (Mintz et al., 2009) and call the term
R (c1, . . . cn) with c R a relation instance.3 It
denotes the membership of the tuple c in the re-
lation R. For example, founded (BILL GATES,
MICROSOFT) is a relation instance denoting that
BILL GATES and MICROSOFT are related in the
founded relation.
In the following we will always consider some set
of candidate tuples C that may or may not be re-
lated. We define Cn C to be set of all n-ary tu-
ples in C. Note that while our definition considers
general n-nary relations, in practice we will restrict
us to unary and binary relations C1 and C2.
Following previous work (Mintz et al., 2009; Ze-
lenko et al., 2003; Culotta and Sorensen, 2004) we
make one more simplifying assumption: every can-
didate tuple can be member of at most one relation.
</bodyText>
<subsectionHeader confidence="0.996369">
2.2 Entity Types
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.9934008">
An entity can be of one or several entity types. For
example, BILL GATES is a person, and a company
founder. Entity types correspond to the special
case of relations with arity one, and will be treated
as such in the following.

\x0cWe care about entity types for two reasons. First,
they can be important for downstream applications:
if consumers of our extracted facts know the type
of entities, they can find them more easily, visu-
alize them more adequately, and perform opera-
tions specific to these types (write emails to persons,
book a hotel in a city, etc.). Second, they are use-
ful for extracting binary relations due to selectional
preferencessee section 2.6.
</bodyText>
<subsectionHeader confidence="0.996735">
2.3 Mentions
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.91805225">
In natural language text spans of tokens are used to
refer to entities. We call such spans entity mentions.
Consider, for example, the following sentence snip-
pet:
</bodyText>
<listItem confidence="0.839159">
(1) Political opponents of President Evo Morales
</listItem>
<bodyText confidence="0.975976647058823">
of Bolivia have in recent days stepped up...
Here Evo Morales is an entity mention of pres-
ident EVO MORALES, and Bolivia a mention of
the country BOLIVIA he is the president of.
People often express relations between entities in
natural language texts by mentioning the participat-
ing entities in specific syntactic and lexical patterns.
We will refer to any tuple of mentions of entities
(e1, . . . en) in a sentence as candidate mention tu-
ple. If such a candidate expresses the relation R,
then it is a relation mention of the relation instance
R (e1, . . . , en).
Consider again example 1. Here the pair of en-
tity mentions (Evo Morales, Bolivia) is a candi-
date mention tuple. In fact, in this case the candidate
is indeed a relation mention of the relation instance
nationality (EVO MORALES, BOLIVIA).
</bodyText>
<subsectionHeader confidence="0.993343">
2.4 Relation Extraction
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999554033333333">
We define the task of relation extraction as follows.
We are given a corpus of documents and a set of
target relations. Then we are asked to predict all re-
lation instances I so that for each R (c) I there
exists at least one relation mention in the given cor-
pus.
The above definition covers a range of existing
approaches by varying over what we define as tar-
get corpus. On one end, we have extractors that
process text on a per sentence basis (Zelenko et al.,
2003; Culotta and Sorensen, 2004). On the other
end, we have methods that take relation mentions
from several documents and use these as input fea-
tures (Mintz et al., 2009; Bunescu and Mooney,
2007).
There is a compelling reason for performing re-
lation extraction within a larger scope that consid-
ers mentions across documents: redundancy. Often
facts are mentioned in several sentences and doc-
uments. Some of these mentions may be difficult
to parse, or they use unseen patterns. But the more
mentions we consider, the higher the probability that
one does parse, and fits a pattern we have seen in the
training data.
Note that for relation extraction that considers
more than a single mention we have to solve the
coreference problem in order to determine which
mentions refer to the same entity. In the follow-
ing we will assume that coreference clusters are pro-
vided by a preprocessing step.

2.5 Distant Supervision
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.984618230769231">
In relation extraction we often encounter a lack of
explicitly annotated text, but an abundance of struc-
tured data sources such as company databases or col-
laborative knowledge bases like Freebase. In order
to exploit this, many approaches use simple but ef-
fective heuristics to align existing facts with unla-
belled text. This labelled text can then be used as
training material of a supervised learner.
One heuristic is to assume that each candidate
mention tuple of a training fact is indeed expressing
the corresponding relation (Bunescu and Mooney,
2007). Mintz et al. (2009) refer to this as the dis-
tant supervision assumption.
Clearly, this heuristic can fail. Let us again
consider the nationality relation between EVO
MORALES and BOLIVIA. In an 2007 article of the
New York Times we find this relation mention can-
didate:
(2) ...the troubles faced by Evo Morales in
Bolivia...
This sentence does not directly express that EVO
MORALES is a citizen of BOLIVIA, and hence vi-
olates the distant supervision assumption. The prob-
lem with this observation is that at training time
we may learn a relatively large weight for the
feature &amp;lt;Entity1&amp;gt; in &amp;lt;Entity2&amp;gt; associated with

encounter a sentence such as

2.6 Global Consistency of Facts
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.9990775625">
As discussed above, distant supervision can lead to
noisy extractions. However, such noise can often be
easily identified by testing how compatible the ex-
tracted facts are to each other. In this work we are
concerned with a particular type of compatibility:
selectional preferences.
Relations require, or prefer, their arguments to be
of certain types. For example, the nationality
relation requires the first argument to be a person,
and the second to be a country. On inspection,
we find that these preferences are often not satis-
fied in a baseline distant supervision system akin to
Mintz et al. (2009). This often results from patterns
such as &amp;lt;Entity1&amp;gt; in &amp;lt;Entity2&amp;gt; that fire in many
cases where &amp;lt;Entity2&amp;gt; is a location, but not a
country.

3 Model
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.9709150625">
Our observations in the previous section suggest
that we should (a) explicitly model compatibil-
ity between extracted facts, and (b) integrate ev-
idence from several documents to exploit redun-
dancy. In this work we choose a Conditional Ran-
dom Field (CRF) to achieve this. CRFs are a natural
fit for this task: They allow us to capture correlations
in an explicit fashion, and to incorporate overlapping
input features from multiple documents.
The hidden output variables of our model are Y =
(Yc)cC. That is, we have one variable Yc for each
candidate tuple c C . This variable can take as
value any relation in C with the same arity as c. See
example relation variables in figure 1.

We also add a template TPair that measures the
pairwise compatibility between the relation variable
Ye1,...,ea and each entity variable Yei in isolation.
Here we use features fPair

gument of c, has the entity type t and the candidate

is in state person, and Ye1,e2 in state founded, re-
gardless of the state of Ye2 .

3.2 Inference
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.998357777777778">
There are two types of inference we have to perform:
sampling from the posterior during training (see sec-
tion 3.3), and finding the most likely configuration
(aka MAP inference). In both settings we employ a
Gibbs sampler (Geman and Geman, 1990) that ran-
domly picks a variable Yc and samples its relation
value conditioned on its Markov Blanket. At test
time we decrease the temperature of our sampler in
order to find an approximation of the MAP solution.

3.3 Training
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.995904647058823">
Most learning methods need to calculate the model
expectations (Lafferty et al., 2001) or the MAP con-
figuration (Collins, 2002) before making an update
to the parameters. This step of inference is usually
the bottleneck for learning, even when performed
approximately.
SampleRank (Wick et al., 2009) is a rank-based
learning framework that alleviates this problem by
performing parameter updates within MCMC infer-
ence. Every pair of consecutive samples in the
MCMC chain is ranked according to the model and
the ground truth, and the parameters are updated
when the rankings disagree. This update can fol-
low different schemes, here we use MIRA (Cram-
mer and Singer, 2003). This allows the learner to
acquire more supervision per instance, and has led
to efficient training for models in which inference

Distant Supervision Learning to extract relations

by using distant supervision has raised much interest
in recent years. Our work is inspired by Mintz et al.
(2009) who also use Freebase as distant supervision
source. We also heuristically align our knowledge
base to text by making the distant supervision as-
sumption (Bunescu and Mooney, 2007; Mintz et al.,
2009). However, in contrast to these previous ap-
proaches, and other related distant supervision meth-
ods (Craven and Kumlien, 1999; Weld et al., 2009;
Hoffmann et al., 2010), we perform relation extrac-
tion collectively with entity type prediction.
Schoenmackers et al. (2008) use entailment rules
on assertion extracted by TextRunner to increase re-
call. They also perform cross-document probabilis-
tic inference based on Markov Networks. However,
they do not infer the types of entities and work in an
open IE setting.
Selectional Preferences In the context of super-
vised relation extraction, selectional preferences
have been applied. For example, Roth and Yih
(2007) have used Linear Programming to enforce
consistency between entity types and extracted re-
lations. Kate and Mooney (2010) use a pyramid
parsing scheme to achieve the same. Riedel et al.
(2009) use Markov Logic to model interactions be-
tween event-argument relations for biomedical event
extraction. However, their work is (a) supervised,
and (b) performs extraction on a per-sentence basis.
Carlson et al. (2010) also use selectional prefer-
ences. However, instead of exploiting them for train-
ing a graphical model using distant supervision, they
use selectional preferences to improve a bootstrap-
ping process. Here in each iteration of bootstrap-
ping, extracted facts that violate compatibility con-
straints will not be used to generate additional pat-
terns in the next iteration.

To answer these questions we carry out experi-

5.1 Experimental Setup
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.9978946">
We follow Mintz et al. (2009) and perform two types
of evaluation: held-out and manual. In both cases
we have a training and a test corpus of documents,
and training and test sets of entities. For held-out
evaluation we split the set of entities in Freebase into
training and test sets. For manual evaluation we use
all Freebase entities during training. For testing we
use all entities that appear in the test document cor-
pus.
For both training and testing we then choose the
candidate tuples C that may or may not be relation
instances. To pick the entities C1 we want to predict
entity types for, we choose all entities that are men-
tioned at least once in the train/test corpus. To pick
the entity pairs C2 that we want to predict the rela-
tions of, we choose those that appear at least once
together in a sentence.
The set of candidates C will contain many tuples
which are not related in any Freebase relations. For
efficiency, we filter out a large fraction of these neg-
ative candidates for training. The number of neg-
ative examples we keep is chosen to be about 10
times the number of positive candidates. This num-
ber stems from trading-off the accuracy it leads to
and the increased training time it requires.
For both manual and held-out evaluation we rank
extracted test relation instances in the MAP state of
the network. This state is found by sampling 20 iter-
ations with a low temperature of 0.00001. The rank-
ing is done according to the log linear score that the
assigned relation for a candidate tuple gets from the
factors in its Markov Blanket. For optimal perfor-
mance, the score is normalized by the number of re-
lation mentions.
For manual evaluation we pick the top ranked 50
relation instances for the most frequent relations.
We ask three annotators to inspect the mentions of
these relation instances to decide whether they are
correct. Upon disagreement, we use majority vote.
To summarize precisions across relations, we take

5.1.1 Data preprocessing
</subsubsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.994317481481481">
We preprocess our textual data as follows:
We first use the Stanford named entity recog-
nizer (Finkel et al., 2005) to find entity mentions in
the corpus. The NER tagger segments each docu-
ment into sentences and classifies each token into
four categories: PERSON, ORGANIZATION, LO-
CATION and NONE. We treat consecutive tokens
which share the same category as single entity men-
tion. Then we associate these mentions with Free-
base entities. This is achieved by performing a
string match between entity mention phrases and the
canonical names of entities as present in Freebase.
For each candidate tuple c with arity 2 and each
of its mention tuples i we extract a set of features Xi
c
similar to those used in (Mintz et al., 2009): lexical,
Part-Of-Speech (POS), named entity and syntactic
features, i.e. features obtained from the dependency
parsing tree of a sentence. We use the openNLP POS
tagger4 to obtain POS tags and employ the Malt-
Parser (Nivre et al., 2004) for dependency parsing.
For candidate tuples with arity 1 (entity types) we
use the following features: the entitys word form,
the POS sequence, the head of the entity in the de-
pendency parse tree, the Stanford named entity tag,
and the left and right words to the current entity
mention phrase.

We apply the following configurations of our fac-

to previous work (Mintz et al., 2009), we pick the

ration as isolated. Next, we add the templates TJoint
and TPair to model selectional preferences, and refer
to this setting as joint.
In addition, we evaluate how well selectional pref-
erences can be captured with a simple pipeline. For
this pipeline we first train an isolated system for en-
tity type prediction. Then we use the output of the
entity type prediction system as input for the relation
extraction system.

5.1.3 Entity types and Relation types
</footnote>
<bodyText confidence="0.996719583333333">
Freebase contains many relation types and only
a subset of those relation types occur frequently
in the corpus. Since classes with very few
training instances are generally hard to learn,
we restrict ourselves to the 54 most frequently
mentioned relations. These include, for ex-
ample, nationality, contains, founded
and place_of_birth. Note that we con-
vert two Freebase non-binary temporal relations
to binary relations: employment_tenure and
place_lived. In both cases we simply disregard
the temporal information in the Freebase data.
As our main focus is relation extraction, we re-
strict ourselves to entity types compatible with our
selected relations. To this end we inspect the Free-
base schema information provided for each relation,
and include those entity types that are declared as
arguments of our relations. This leads to 10 entity
types including person, citytown, country,
and company.
Note that a Freebase entity can have several types.
We pick one of these by choosing the most specific
one that is a member of our entity type subset, or
MISC if no such member exists.

In our first set of experiments we train and test using

all systems perform comparably for weighted aver-
age precision. For average precision we see an ad-
vantage for both the pipeline and the joint model
over the isolated system.
One reason for similar weighted average preci-
sions is the fact that all approaches accurately pre-
dict a large number of contains instances. This is
due to very regular and simple patterns in Wikipedia.
For example, most articles on towns start with A is
a municipality in the district of B in C, D. For these
sentences, the relative position of two location men-
tions is a very good predictor of contains. When
used as a feature, it leads to high precision for all
models. And since contains instances are most
frequent, and we take the weighted average, results
are generally close to each other.
To summarize: in this in-domain setting, mod-
elling compatibility between entity types and rela-
tions helps to improve average precision, but not
weighted average precision. This holds for both the
joint and the pipeline model. However, we will see
how this changes substantially when moving to an
out-of-domain scenario.

Due to the smaller overlap between Freebase and
NYT data, figure 3 also has to be taken with more
caution. The systems may predict correct relation
instances that just do not appear in Freebase. Hence
manual evaluation is even more important.
When evaluating entity precision we find that for
both models it is about 84%. This raises the ques-
tion why the joint entity type and relation extrac-
tion model outperforms the pipeline on relations.
We take a close look at the entities which partici-
pate in relations and find that joint model performs
better on most entity types, for example, country
and citytown. We also look at the relation in-
stances which are predicted by both systems and find
that the joint model does predict correct entity types
when the pipeline mis-predicts. And exactly these
mis-predictions lead the pipeline astray. Consider-
ing binary relation instances where the pipeline fails
but the joint model does not, we observe an entity
precision of 76% for the pipeline and 86% for our
joint approach. The joint model fails to correctly
predict some entity types that the pipeline gets right,
but these tend to appear in contexts where relation
instances are easy to extract without considering en-

Let us look at a break-down of precisions with
respect to different relations shown in table 3. We

6 Conclusion
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999828642857143">
This paper presents a novel approach to extracting
relational facts from text. Akin to previous work in
relation extraction with distant supervision, we re-
quire no annotated text. However, instead extract-
ing facts in isolation, we model interactions between
facts in order to improve precision. In particular, we
capture selectional preferences of relations. These
preferences are modelled in a cross-document fash-
ion using a large scale factor graph. We show in-
ference and learning can be efficiently performed
in linear time by Gibbs Sampling and SampleRank.
When applied to out-of-domain text, this approach
leads to a 15% increase in precision over an isolated
baseline, and a 13% improvement over a pipelined
system.
A crucial aspect of our approach is its extensibil-
ity. Since it is exclusively framed in terms of an
undirected graphical model, it is conceptually easy
to extend it to other types of compatibilities, such
as functionality constraints. It could also be ex-
tended to tackle coreference resolution. Eventually
we seek to model the complete process of the au-
tomatic construction of KB within this framework,
and capture dependencies between extractions in a
joint and principled fashion. As we have seen here,
in particular when learning is less supervised and
extractions are noisy, capturing such interactions is
paramount.

<abstract confidence="0.992329545454545">We present a novel approach to relation extraction that integrates information across documents, performs global inference and requires no labelled text. In particular, we tackle relation extraction and entity identification jointly. We use distant supervision to train a factor graph model for relation extraction based on an existing knowledge base (Freebase, derived in parts from Wikipedia). For inference we run an efficient Gibbs sampler that leads to linear time joint inference. We evaluate our approach both for an indomain (Wikipedia) and a more realistic outof-domain (New York Times Corpus) setting. For the in-domain setting, our joint model leads to 4% higher precision than an isolated local approach, but has no advantage over a pipeline. For the out-of-domain data, we benefit strongly from joint modelling, and observe improvements in precision of 13% over the pipeline, and 15% over the isolated baseline.</abstract>

This includes, for example, the extraction of employer-employee relations mentioned in newswire, or protein-protein interactions expressed in biomedical papers. It also includes the prediction of entity types such as country, citytown or person, if we consider entity types as unary relations. A particularly attractive approach to relation extraction is based on distant supervision.1 Here in 1 Also called self training, or weak supervision. place of annotated text, only an existing knowledge base (KB) is needed to train a relation extractor (Mintz et al., 2009; Bunescu and Mooney, 2007; Riedel et al., 2010). The facts in the KB are heuristically aligned to an unlabelled training corpus, and the resulting alignment is the basis for learning the extractor. Naturally, the predictions of a distantly supervised relation extractor will be less accurate than those of a supervised one. While facts of existing knowledge bases are inexpensive to come by, the heuristic alignment to text will often lead to noisy patterns in learning. When applied to unseen text, these patterns will produce noisy facts. Indeed, we find that extraction precision still leaves much room for improvement. Th</context>

Then we are asked to predict all relation instances I so that for each R (c) I there exists at least one relation mention in the given corpus. The above definition covers a range of existing approaches by varying over what we define as target corpus. On one end, we have extractors that process text on a per sentence basis (Zelenko et al., 2003; Culotta and Sorensen, 2004). On the other end, we have methods that take relation mentions from several documents and use these as input features (Mintz et al., 2009; Bunescu and Mooney, 2007). There is a compelling reason for performing relation extraction within a larger scope that considers mentions across documents: redundancy. Often facts are mentioned in several sentences and documents. Some of these mentions may be difficult to parse, or they use unseen patterns. But the more mentions we consider, the higher the probability that one does parse, and fits a pattern we have seen in the training data. Note that for relation extraction that considers more than a single mention we have to solve the coreference problem in order to determine which mentions refer to the same entity. </context>

In order to exploit this, many approaches use simple but effective heuristics to align existing facts with unlabelled text. This labelled text can then be used as training material of a supervised learner. One heuristic is to assume that each candidate mention tuple of a training fact is indeed expressing the corresponding relation (Bunescu and Mooney, 2007). Mintz et al. (2009) refer to this as the distant supervision assumption. Clearly, this heuristic can fail. Let us again consider the nationality relation between EVO MORALES and BOLIVIA. In an 2007 article of the New York Times we find this relation mention candidate: (2) ...the troubles faced by Evo Morales in Bolivia... This sentence does not directly express that EVO MORALES is a citizen of BOLIVIA, and hence violates the distant supervision assumption. The problem with this observation is that at training time we may learn a relatively large weight for the feature &amp;lt;Entity1&amp;gt; in &amp;lt;Entity2&amp;gt; </context>

In both settings we employ a Gibbs sampler (Geman and Geman, 1990) that randomly picks a variable Yc and samples its relation value conditioned on its Markov Blanket. At test time we decrease the temperature of our sampler in order to find an approximation of the MAP solution. 3.3 Training Most learning methods need to calculate the model expectations (Lafferty et al., 2001) or the MAP configuration (Collins, 2002) before making an update to the parameters. This step of inference is usually the bottleneck for learning, even when performed approximately. SampleRank (Wick et al., 2009) is a rank-based learning framework that alleviates this problem by performing parameter updates within MCMC inference. Every pair of consecutive samples in the MCMC chain is ranked according to the model and the ground truth, and the parameters are updated when the rankings disagree.

In the following we will always consider some set of candidate tuples C that may or may not be related. We define Cn C to be set of all n-ary tuples in C. Note that while our definition considers general n-nary relations, in practice we will restrict us to unary and binary relations C1 and C2.

For manual evaluation we pick the top ranked 50 relation instances for the most frequent relations. We ask three annotators to inspect the mentions of these relation instances to decide whether they are correct. Upon disagreement, we use majority vote. To summarize precisions across relations, we take 1018 \x0ctheir average, and their average weighted by the proportion of predicted instances for the given relation. 5.1.1 Data preprocessing We preprocess our textual data as follows: We first use the Stanford named entity recognizer (Finkel et al., 2005) to find entity mentions in the corpus. The NER tagger segments each document into sentences and classifies each token into four categories: PERSON, ORGANIZATION, LOCATION and NONE. We treat consecutive tokens which share the same category as single entity mention. Then we associate these mentions with Freebase entities. This is achieved by performing a string match between entity mention phrases and the canonical names of entities as present in Freebase. For each candidate tuple c with arity 2 and each of its mention tuples i we extract a set of features Xi c similar to those used in (Mintz e</context>

An example is the fact that the first argument of nationality is always a person while the second is a country. A simple way to address this is a pipeline: first predict entity types, and then condition on these when predicting relations. However, this neglects the fact that relations could as well be used to help entity type prediction. 1013 \x0cWhile there is some existing work on enforcing such constraints in a joint fashion (Roth and Yih, 2007; Kate and Mooney, 2010; Riedel et al., 2009), they are not directly applicable here. The difference is the amount of facts they take into account at the same time. They focus on single sentence extractions, and only consider very few interacting facts. This allows them to work with exact optimization techniques such as (Integer) Linear Programs and still remain efficient.2 However, when working on a sentence level they fail to exploit the redundancy present in a corpus.

Kate and Mooney (2010) use a pyramid parsing scheme to achieve the same. Riedel et al. (2009) use Markov Logic to model interactions between event-argument relations for biomedical event extraction. However, their work is (a) supervised, and (b) performs extraction on a per-sentence basis. Carlson et al. (2010) also use selectional preferences.

In both settings we employ a Gibbs sampler (Geman and Geman, 1990) that randomly picks a variable Yc and samples its relation value conditioned on its Markov Blanket. At test time we decrease the temperature of our sampler in order to find an approximation of the MAP solution. 3.3 Training Most learning methods need to calculate the model expectations (Lafferty et al., 2001) or the MAP configuration (Collins, 2002) before making an update to the parameters. This step of inference is usually the bottleneck for learning, even when performed approximately. SampleRank (Wick et al., 2009) is a rank-based learning framework that alleviates this problem by performing parameter updates within MCMC inference. Every pair of consecutive samples in the MCMC chain is ranked according to the model and the ground truth, and the parameters are updated when the rankings disagree. This update can follow different schemes, here we use MIRA (Crammer and Singer, 2003). This allows th</context>

The facts in the KB are heuristically aligned to an unlabelled training corpus, and the resulting alignment is the basis for learning the extractor. Naturally, the predictions of a distantly supervised relation extractor will be less accurate than those of a supervised one. While facts of existing knowledge bases are inexpensive to come by, the heuristic alignment to text will often lead to noisy patterns in learning.

It is based on an undirected graphical model in which variables correspond to facts, and factors between them measure compatibility. In order to scale up, we run an efficient Gibbs-Sampler at inference time, and train our model using SampleRank (Wick et al., 2009). In practice this leads to a runtime behaviour that is linear in the size of the corpus. For example, 200,000 documents take less than three hours for training and testing. For evaluation we consider two scenarios. First we follow Mintz et al. (2009), use Freebase as source of distant supervision, and employ Wikipedia as source of unlabelled textwe will call this an in-domain setting. This scenario is somewhat artificial in that Freebase itself is partially derived from Wikipedia, and in practice we cannot expect text and training knowledge base to be so close. Hence we also evaluate our approach on the New York Times corpus (out-of-domain setting). For in-domain data we make the following finding. When we compare to an isolated baseline that makes no use of entity types, our joint model improves average precision by 4%. However, it does </context>

After discussing related work, we present our empirical results and conclude. 2 Background In this section we will introduce the terminology and concepts we use throughout the paper. We will also give a brief introduction to relation extraction, in particular in the context of distant supervision. 2.1 Relations We seek to extract facts about entities. Example entities would be the company founder BILL GATES, the company MICROSOFT, and the country USA. A relation R is a set of tuples c over entities. We will follow (Mintz et al., 2009) and call the term R (c1, . . . cn) with c R a relation instance.3 It denotes the membership of the tuple c in the relation R. For example, founded (BILL GATES, MICROSOFT) is a relation instance denoting that BILL GATES and MICROSOFT are related in the founded relation. In the following we will always consider some set of candidate tuples C that may or may not be related. We define Cn C to be set of all n-ary tuples in C. Note that while our definition considers general n-nary relations, in practice we will restrict us to unary and binary relations C1 and C2. Following previous work (Mintz et </context>

We are given a corpus of documents and a set of target relations. Then we are asked to predict all relation instances I so that for each R (c) I there exists at least one relation mention in the given corpus. The above definition covers a range of existing approaches by varying over what we define as target corpus. On one end, we have extractors that process text on a per sentence basis (Zelenko et al., 2003; Culotta and Sorensen, 2004). On the other end, we have methods that take relation mentions from several documents and use these as input features (Mintz et al., 2009; Bunescu and Mooney, 2007). There is a compelling reason for performing relation extraction within a larger scope that considers mentions across documents: redundancy. Often facts are mentioned in several sentences and documents. Some of these mentions may be difficult to parse, or they use unseen patterns. But the more mentions we consider, the higher the probability that one does parse, and fits a pattern we have seen in the training data. Note that for relation extraction that considers more than a single mention we have to solve the coreference problem in order to determine which mentions</context>

In order to exploit this, many approaches use simple but effective heuristics to align existing facts with unlabelled text. This labelled text can then be used as training material of a supervised learner. One heuristic is to assume that each candidate mention tuple of a training fact is indeed expressing the corresponding relation (Bunescu and Mooney, 2007). Mintz et al. (2009) refer to this as the distant supervision assumption. Clearly, this heuristic can fail. Let us again consider the nationality relation between EVO MORALES and BOLIVIA. In an 2007 article of the New York Times we find this relation mention candidate: (2) ...the troubles faced by Evo Morales in Bolivia... This sentence does not directly express that EVO MORALES is a citizen of BOLIVIA, and hence violates the distant supervision assumption. The problem with this observation is that at training time we may learn a relatively large weight for the feature &amp;lt;Entity1&amp;gt; in &amp;lt;Entity2&amp;gt; associated with 1015 </context>
<context position="12834" citStr="Mintz et al. (2009)" startWordPosition="2133" endWordPosition="2136">ency of Facts As discussed above, distant supervision can lead to noisy extractions. However, such noise can often be easily identified by testing how compatible the extracted facts are to each other. In this work we are concerned with a particular type of compatibility: selectional preferences. Relations require, or prefer, their arguments to be of certain types. For example, the nationality relation requires the first argument to be a person, and the second to be a country. On inspection, we find that these preferences are often not satisfied in a baseline distant supervision system akin to Mintz et al. (2009). This often results from patterns such as &amp;lt;Entity1&amp;gt; in &amp;lt;Entity2&amp;gt; that fire in many cases where &amp;lt;Entity2&amp;gt; is a location, but not a country. 3 Model Our observations in the previous section suggest that we should (a) explicitly model compatibility between extracted facts, and (b) integrate evidence from several documents to exploit redundancy. In this work we choose a Conditional Random Field (CRF) to achieve this. CRFs are a natural fit for this task: They allow us to capture correlations in an explicit fashion, and to incorporate overlapping input features from multiple documents. The hidden </context>

For this purpose we define the template TMen that connects each relation instance variable Yc with its observed mention variables Xc. Crucially, this template gathers mentions from multiple documents, and enables us to exploit redundancy. The feature functions of this template are taken from Mintz et al. (2009).

While facts of existing knowledge bases are inexpensive to come by, the heuristic alignment to text will often lead to noisy patterns in learning. When applied to unseen text, these patterns will produce noisy facts. Indeed, we find that extraction precision still leaves much room for improvement. This room is not as large as in previous work (Mintz et al., 2009) where target text and training KB are closely related. However, when we use the knowledge base Freebase (Bollacker et al., 2008) and the New York Times corpus (Sandhaus, 2008), we observe very low precision. For example, the precision of the top-ranked 50 nationality relation instances is only 28%. On inspection, it turns out that many of the errors can be easily identified: they amount to violations of basic compatibility constraints between facts. In particular, we observe unsatisfied selectional preferences of relations towards particular entity types as types of their arguments. An example is the fact that the first argument of nationality is always a person while the second is a country. A simple way to address this is a pipeline: first predict entity types, a</context>

Moreover, the fewer facts they consider at the same time, the lower the chance that some of these will be incompatible, and that modelling compatibility will make a difference. In this work we present a novel approach that performs relation extraction across documents, enforces selectional preferences, and needs no labelled data. It is based on an undirected graphical model in which variables correspond to facts, and factors between them measure compatibility. In order to scale up, we run an efficient Gibbs-Sampler at inference time, and train our model using SampleRank (Wick et al., 2009). In practice this leads to a runtime behaviour that is linear in the size of the corpus. For example, 200,000 documents take less than three hours for training and testing. For evaluation we consider two scenarios. First we follow Mintz et al. (2009), use Freebase as source of distant supervision, and employ Wikipedia as source of unlabelled textwe will call this an in-domain setting. This scenario is somewhat artificial in that Freebase itself is partially derived from Wikipedia, and in practice we cannot expect text and training knowledge base to be so close. Hence we also evaluate our appr</context>

In both settings we employ a Gibbs sampler (Geman and Geman, 1990) that randomly picks a variable Yc and samples its relation value conditioned on its Markov Blanket. At test time we decrease the temperature of our sampler in order to find an approximation of the MAP solution. 3.3 Training Most learning methods need to calculate the model expectations (Lafferty et al., 2001) or the MAP configuration (Collins, 2002) before making an update to the parameters. This step of inference is usually the bottleneck for learning, even when performed approximately. SampleRank (Wick et al., 2009) is a rank-based learning framework that alleviates this problem by performing parameter updates within MCMC inference. Every pair of consecutive samples in the MCMC chain is ranked according to the model and the ground truth, and the parameters are updated when the rankings disagree.

For example, founded (BILL GATES, MICROSOFT) is a relation instance denoting that BILL GATES and MICROSOFT are related in the founded relation. In the following we will always consider some set of candidate tuples C that may or may not be related. We define Cn C to be set of all n-ary tuples in C. Note that while our definition considers general n-nary relations, in practice we will restrict us to unary and binary relations C1 and C2. Following previous work (Mintz et al., 2009; Zelenko et al., 2003; Culotta and Sorensen, 2004) we make one more simplifying assumption: every candidate tuple can be member of at most one relation. 2.2 Entity Types An entity can be of one or several entity types. For example, BILL GATES is a person, and a company founder. Entity types correspond to the special case of relations with arity one, and will be treated as such in the following. 3 Other commonly used terms are relational facts, ground facts, ground atoms, and assertions. 1014 \x0cWe care about entity types for two reasons.

In fact, in this case the candidate is indeed a relation mention of the relation instance nationality (EVO MORALES, BOLIVIA). 2.4 Relation Extraction We define the task of relation extraction as follows. We are given a corpus of documents and a set of target relations. Then we are asked to predict all relation instances I so that for each R (c) I there exists at least one relation mention in the given corpus. The above definition covers a range of existing approaches by varying over what we define as target corpus. On one end, we have extractors that process text on a per sentence basis (Zelenko et al., 2003; Culotta and Sorensen, 2004). On the other end, we have methods that take relation mentions from several documents and use these as input features (Mintz et al., 2009; Bunescu and Mooney, 2007). There is a compelling reason for performing relation extraction within a larger scope that considers mentions across documents: redundancy. Often facts are mentioned in several sentences and documents. Some of these mentions may be difficult to parse, or they use unseen patterns. But the more mentions we consider, the higher the probability that one does parse, and fits a pattern we have seen in the t</context>
