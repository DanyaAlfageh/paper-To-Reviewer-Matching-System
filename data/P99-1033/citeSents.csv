This last condition of projectivity (or various extensions of it; see e.g., Lau and Huang (1994)) is usually assumed by most computational approaches to dependency grammars as a constraint for filtering configurations, and has also been used as a simplifying condition in statistical approaches for inducing dependencies from corpora (e.g., Yiiret(1998).) 3 Turkish Turkish is an agglutinative language where a sequence of inflectional and derivational morphemes get affixed to a root CITATION,,
