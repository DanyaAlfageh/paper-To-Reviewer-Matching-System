 The potential of morphological information to improve parsing performance has been documented in numerous experiments using MaltParser and with various morphological attributes as machine learning features, on several morphologically rich languages, including: Russian CITATION; Swedish CITATION; Bangla, Telugu, and Hindi CITATION; Turkish CITATION; and Basque CITATION,,
 CITATION found that using morphological features increased the accuracy of MSTParser on Hebrew only when the morphological annotations were gold-standard; automatic annotations decreased accuracy, although MaltParser showed improvement with both gold and automatic annotations,,
 A similar approach was used by CITATION, who improved the accuracy of their transition-based Hebrew parser by adding features for gender and number agreement in noun phrases,,

 We normalized the coarse tags to the universal twelve-tag set suggested by CITATION, in order to ensure that every treebank had coarse tags for use in the agreement features, and to make the features easier to interpret,,
 Many of these used the CoNLL shared task treebank format, so we adopted it as well, and con2 A more complete description of the system, as well as source code, can be found in CITATION,,

 CITATION used language-specific rules to add detail to other features, such as fine-grained POS tags or lemmas,,
 CITATION modeled agreement explicitly, generating a morphological agreement feature whenever two tokens possess the same value for the same linguistic attribute,,
 A similar approach was used by CITATION, who improved the accuracy of their transition-based Hebrew parser by adding features for gender and number agreement in noun phrases,,
 CITATION investigated this empirically and found that it holds to a certain extent: the absence of agreement and/or case marking predicts rigid word order, though their presence is not particularly predictive of flexible word order,,

3 Related work The organizers of the CoNLL 2007 shared task noted that languages with free word order and high morphological complexity are the most difficult for dependency parsing CITATION,,
 Most of the participants took language-independent approaches toward leveraging this complexity into better performance: generating machine learning features based on each item in a tokens list of morphological attributes (CITATIONb; CITATION); using the entire list as an atomic feature (CITATION; CITATION); or generating features based on each pair of attributes in the cross-product of the lists of a potential head and dependent (CITATION; CITATION),,
 Many of these used the CoNLL shared task treebank format, so we adopted it as well, and con2 A more complete description of the system, as well as source code, can be found in CITATION,,
