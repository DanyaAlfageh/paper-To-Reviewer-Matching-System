CITATION modeled agreement explicitly, generating a morphological agreement feature whenever two tokens possess the same value for the same linguistic attribute,,
CITATION,,
2.3 Related work The organizers of the CoNLL 2007 shared task noted that languages with free word order and high morphological complexity are the most difficult for dependency parsing CITATION,,
Most of the participants took language-independent approaches toward leveraging this complexity into better performance: generating machine learning features based on each item in a tokens list of morphological attributes (CITATIONb; CITATION); using the entire list as an atomic feature (CITATION; CITATION); or generating features based on each pair of attributes in the cross-product of the lists of a potential head and dependent (CITATION; CITATION),,
CITATION used language-specific rules to add detail to other features, such as fine-grained POS tags or lemmas,,
A similar approach was used by CITATION, who improved the accuracy of their transition-based Hebrew parser by adding features for gender and number agre,,
