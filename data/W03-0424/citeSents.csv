CITATION, CITATION) reported results significantly lower than the best system CITATION,,
However, CITATION have reported state of the art results on the MUC-6 and MUC-7 data using a HMM-based tagger,,
CITATION used a wide variety of features, which suggests that the relatively poor performance of the taggers used in CoNLL-2002 was largely due to the feature sets used rather than the machine learning method,,

The additional orthographic features have proved useful in other systems, for example CITATION, CITATION and CITATION,,
CITATION) whilst others gained significant improvement using gazetteers and triggers (e.g,,
CITATION),,
CITATION includes a number of interesting contextual predicates for NER,,
These improve upon the scores of the best performing system at CoNLL-2002 CITATION,,
The tagger uses a Gaussian prior over the weights CITATION which allows a large number of rare, but informative, features to be used without overfitting,,
CITATION) whilst others gained significant improvement using gazetteers and triggers (e.g,,
CITATION),,
CITATION includes a number of interesting contextual predicates for NER,,
The frequency counts have been obtained from 1 billion words of English newspaper text collected by CITATION,,
CITATION also describes a mapping from words to word types which groups words with similar orthographic forms into classes,,
2 The ME Tagger The ME tagger is based on CITATIONs POS tagger and is described in CITATION ,,
4 The Feature Set Table 1 lists the contextual predicates used in our baseline system, which are based on those used in the CITATION CCG supertagger,,
