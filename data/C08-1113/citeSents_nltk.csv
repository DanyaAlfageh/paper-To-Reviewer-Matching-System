We used label entropy CITATION, H(ys t ) = ys t Y s t P (ys t |x) ln P (ys t |x) , as importance metric of each word occurrence, where is the model parameter of CRFS , and ys t = (yt, yt+1, , ys) Y s t is a subsequence starting at t and ending at s in y.,,
The text data for the target domain is composed of sentences in a medical reference manual CITATION .,,
Our model is interpreted as one of the CRFs with hidden variables CITATION.,,
There are previous work which handles hidden variables in discriminative parsers (CITATION; CITATION).,,
For interactive annotation, CITATION proposed corrective feedback that effectively reduces user operations utilizing partial annotations.,,

Previous work CITATION showed CRFs outperform generative Markov models and discriminative history-based methods in JWS.,,
One of the recent advances in statistical NLP is Conditional Random Fields (CRFs) CITATION that evaluate the global consistency of the complete structures for both parameter estimation and structure inference, instead of optimizing the local configurations independently.,,
4 Marginalized Likelihood for CRFs In this section, we propose a parameter estimation procedure for the CRFs CITATION incorporating partial or ambiguous annotations.,,
In addition, the boundary agreement is even lower in Chinese CITATION.,,
As mentioned in Section 2.2, there are words which have two or more candidate POS tags in the PTB corpus CITATION.,,
To utilize those domain word lists, CITATION proposed a KWIC (KeyWord In Context) style annotation user interface (UI) with which a user can delimit a word in a context with a single user action.,,

Although this non-concavity prevents efficient global maximization of equation (3), it still allows us to incorporate incomplete annotations using gradient ascent iterations CITATION.,,
However, there are some NLP tasks, such as the word alignment task CITATION, in which it is not possible to efficiently calculate the sum score of all of the possible label configurations.,,
Recently, CITATION independently proposed a parameter estimation method for CRFs using partially labeled images.,,
