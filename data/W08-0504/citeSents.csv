 This parsing approach is very similar to the one used successfully by CITATION, but we use a maximum entropy classifier CITATION to determine parser actions, which makes parsing considerably faster,,

 2 Motivation and related work While recent work has addressed questions relating to the use of different parsers or different types of syntactic representations in the PPI extraction task (CITATION, CITATION), little concrete evidence has been provided for potential benefits of improved parsers or additional resources for training syntactic parsers,,

 When we combine these results with the findings obtained by CITATION, they suggest that a better way to improve the overall system is to spend more effort in designing a specific syntactic representation that addresses the needs of the system, instead of using a generic representation designed for measuring parser accuracy,,
 When combined with recent findings by CITATION, our results indicate that further work in designing PPI extraction systems that use syntactic dependency features would benefit from more adequate syntactic representations or more sophisticated use of NLP than simple extraction of syntactic subtrees,,
