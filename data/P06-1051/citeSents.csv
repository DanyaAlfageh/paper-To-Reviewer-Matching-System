 These transformations are logical rules in CITATION or sequences of allowed rewrite rules in (de Salvo CITATION),,
 As described in CITATION, can be computed in O(|Nt1 | |Nt2 |),,
 Unfortunately, a counterexample illustrated in CITATION shows that the max function does not produce valid kernels in general,,
 However, we observe that: (1) Ks((T0, H0), (T00, H00)) is a symmetric function since the set of transformation C are always computed with respect to the pair that has the largest anchor set; (2) in CITATION, it is shown that when kernel functions are not positive semidefinite, SVMs still solve a data separation problem in pseudo Euclidean spaces,,
 We also used the following resources: - The Charniak parser CITATION and the morpha lemmatiser CITATION to carry out the syntactic and morphological analysis,,

, the tree kernel devised in CITATION,,
 As the corresponding maximum quantifies the alignment degree, we could define a cross-pair similarity as follows: Ks((T0 , H0 ), (T00 , H00 )) = max cC \x10 KT (t(H0 , c), t(H00 , i)) +KT (t(T0 , c), t(T00 , i) \x11 , (6) where as KT (t1, t2) we use the tree kernel function defined in CITATION,,

 A first class of methods defines measures of the distance or similarity between T and H either assuming the independence between words (CITATION; Glickman et al,,

 In line with CITATION, we define it as: s1(T, H) = X (wt,wh)A simw(wt, wh) idf(wh) X whWH idf(wh) (3) where idf(w) is the inverse document frequency of the word w,,
