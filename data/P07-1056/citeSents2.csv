First, we showed that for a given source and target domain, we can significantly improve for sentiment classification the structural correspondence learning model of CITATION,,
The work most similar in spirit to ours that of CITATION,,
CITATION treat sentiment analysis as an ordinal ranking problem,,
While movie reviews have been the most studied domain, sentiment analysis has extended to a number of new domains, ranging from stock message boards to congressional floor debates (CITATION; CITATION),,
440 \x0crespondence learning (SCL) domain adaptation algorithm CITATION for use in sentiment classification,,
1 Introduction Sentiment detection and classification has received considerable attention recently (CITATION; CITATION; CITATION),,
Second, we evaluate the A-distance CITATION between domain,,
Using the notation of CITATION, we can write the supervised training objective of SCL on the source domain as min w,v X i L w0 xi + v0 xi, yi \x01 + ||w||2 + ||v||2 , where y is the label,,
While we do not have a direct comparison, we note that CITATION performs worse on movie reviews than on his other datasets, the same type of data as the polarity dataset,,
We augment each labeled target instance xj with the label assigned by the source domain classifier (CITATION; CITATION),,
As we noted in Section 5, we are able to significantly outperform basic structural correspondence learning CITATION,,
Then, it models the correlations between the pivot features and all other features by training linear pivot predictors to predict occurrences of each pivot in the unlabeled data from both domains (CITATION; CITATION),,
We also note the work of CITATION, who performed a number of empirical tests on domain adapt,,
We also note that while CITATION and CITATION observe that including the label of a source classifier as a feature on small amounts of target data tends to improve over using either the source alone or the target alone, we did not observe that for our data,,
CITATION and CITATION suggest = 104, = 0, which we have used in our results so far,,
