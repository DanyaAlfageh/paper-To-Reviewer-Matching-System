CITATION proposed a two-phase parsing model which includes chunking and attaching,,
The previous best result on chunking in literature was achieved by Regularized Winnow CITATION, which took some of the parsing results given by an English Slot Grammar-based parser as input to the chunker,,
CITATION approached chucking by using Transformation Based Learning(TBL),,
Many machine learning techniques have been successfully applied to chunking tasks, such as Regularized Winnow CITATION, SVMs CITATION, CRFs CITATION, Maximum Entropy Model CITATION, Memory Based Learning CITATION and SNoW CITATION,,
