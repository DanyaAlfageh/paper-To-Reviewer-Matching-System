 The corpus (see Section 4) is distributed with annotations for sentence breaks, tokenization, and part of speech information automatically generated by the GATE toolkit CITATION,,
8 For parsing we use the CITATION parser,,
9 For partial parses, we employ CASS CITATION,,
 For classifier construction, we use the IND package CITATION to train decision trees (we use the mml tree style, a minimum message length criterion with Bayesian smoothing),,
1 of the NRRC corpus CITATION,,
 CITATION, studies methods to track the change of point of view in narrative text (fiction),,
 CITATION examines the lexical semantics of speech event verbs in the context of generative lexicon theory,,
 Finally, CITATION present preliminary results for the automatic identification of perspective and speech expressions using corpus-based techniques,,
 CITATION proposes a computational model of the reader of a news article,,
 CITATION seek to extract propositional 3 In CITATION, this is referred to as the inside,,
 Namely, CITATION do not consider sentences that contain multiple pses, and do not, therefore, need to identify any indirect sources of opinions,,
 An advantage over our work, however, is that CITATION do not require separate solutions to pse identification and the identification of their direct sources,,

1 Evaluation How do we evaluate the performance of an automatic method of determining the hierarchical structure of pses? CITATION proposes a method for evaluating dependency parses: the score for a sentence is the fraction of correct parent links identified; the score for the corpus is the average sentence score,,
