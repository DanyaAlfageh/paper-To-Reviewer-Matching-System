CITATION examines the lexical semantics of speech event verbs in the context of generative lexicon theory,,0
Namely, CITATION do not consider sentences that contain multiple pses, and do not, therefore, need to identify any indirect sources of opinions,,0
CITATION, studies methods to track the change of point of view in narrative text (fiction),,0
 sentence breaks, tokenization, and part of speech information automatically generated by the GATE toolkit CITATION.8 For parsing we use the CITATION parser.9 For partial parses, we employ CASS CITATION,,0
9 We convert the parse to a dependency format that makes some of our features simpler using a method similar to the one described in CITATION,,0
4 Data Description The data for these experiments come from version 1.1 of the NRRC corpus CITATION.10,,0
See (CITATION, page 17) and (CITATION, pages 430-433) for descriptions of this method,,0

The corpus (see Section 4) is distributed with annotations for sentence breaks, tokenization, and part of speech information automatically generated by the GATE toolkit CITATION.8 For parsing we use the CITATION parser.9 For partial parses, we employ CASS CITATION,,0

In an evaluation using the opinion-annotated NRRC corpus CITATION, the learning-based approach achieves an accuracy of 78.30%, significantly higher than both the simple baseline approach (65.57%) and the parse-based baseline (71.64%),,0
It is important for understanding both newswire and narrative text CITATION, therefore, to appropriately recognize expressions of point of view, and to associate them with their direct and indirect sources,,0
Note that the acronym pse has been used previously with a different meaning CITATION,,0
For classifier construction, we use the IND package CITATION to train decision trees (we use the mml tree style, a minimum message length criterion with Bayesian smoothing),,0
 is that CITATION do not require separate solutions to pse identification and the identification of their direct sources,,0
CITATION proposes a computational model of the reader of a news article,,0
5 Results and Discussion 5.1 Evaluation How do we evaluate the performance of an automatic method of determining the hierarchical structure of pses? CITATION proposes a method for evaluating dependency parses: the score for a sentence is the fraction of correct parent links identified; the score for the corpus is the average sentence score,,1
Finally, CITATION present preliminary results for the automatic identification of perspective and speech expressions using corpus-based techniques,,
CITATION seek to extract propositional 3 In CITATION, this is referred to as the inside,,0
An advantage over our work, however, is that CITATION do not require separate solutions to pse identification and the identification of their direct sources,,1
