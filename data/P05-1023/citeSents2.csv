In particular, most of the work on parsing with kernel methods has focussed on kernels over parse trees (CITATION; CITATION; CITATION; CITATION),,
First note that the parser based on the TOP efficient kernel has better accuracy than CITATION, which used the same parsing method as our baseline model, although the trained network parameters were not the same,,
When compared to other kernel methods, our approach performs better than those based on the Tree kernel (CITATION; CITATION), and is only 0.2% worse than the best results achieved by a kernel method for parsing (Shen et al., 200,,
For comparison to previous results, table 2 lists the results on the testing set for our best model (TOP-Efficient-Freq20) and several other statistical parsers (CITATION; CITATION; CITATION; CITATION; CITATION; CITATION; CITATION; CITATION; CITATION; CITATION),,
Some work in machine learning has taken an alternative approach to defining kernels, where the kernel is derived from a probabilistic model of the task (CITATION; CITATION),,
