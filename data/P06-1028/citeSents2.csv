However, MCE-F showed the better performance of 85.29 compared with CITATION of 84.04, which used the MAP training of CRFs with a feature selection architecture, yielding similar results to the MAP results described here,,
With Chunking, CITATION reported the best F-score of 93.91 with the voting of several models trained by Support Vector Machine in the same experimental settings and with the same feature set,,
The modeling power of CRFs has been of great benefit in several applications, such as shallow parsing CITATION and information extraction CITATION,,
The first approach to estimating CRF parameters is the maximum likelihood (ML) criterion over conditional probability p(y|x) itself CITATION,,
The maximum a posteriori (MAP) criterion over parameters, , given x and y is the natural choice for reducing over-fitting CITATION,,
