 1 Introduction There has been a great deal of progress in statistical parsing in the past decade (CITATION; CITATION; Chaniak, 2000),,
 It was found in CITATION that the removal of bi-lexical statistics from a state-of-the-art PCFG parser resulted very small change in the output,,
 CITATION observed that the bi-lexical statistics accounted for only 1,,
 CITATION presented an unlexicalized parser that eliminated all lexicalized parameters,,
 We used the same data split as CITATION: Sections 1-270 and 400-931 as 156 \x0cthe training set, Sections 271-300 as testing and Sections 301-325 as the development set,,
 We converted them to dependency trees using the same method and the head table as CITATION,,
 In the DMV model CITATION, the probability of a dependency link is partly conditioned on whether or not there is a head word of the link already has a modifier,,

 The generation process according to the canonical order is similar to the head outward generation process in CITATION, except that it is bottom-up whereas Collins models are top-down,,

 Similarity-based smoothing was used in CITATION to estimate word co-occurrence probabilities,,
 In CITATION, the bigram probability P(w2|w1) is computed as the weighted average of the conditional probability of w2 given similar words of w1,,
 A difference between similarity-based smoothing in CITATION and our approach is that our model only computes probability distributions of binary variables,,
 Firstly, when a context contains two words, we are able to use the cross product of the similar words, whereas CITATION can only use the similar words of one of the words,,
 Secondly, in CITATION, the distribution P(|w1) may itself be sparsely observed,,
 The similarity-based smoothing method in CITATION uses the similar words of one of the words in a bigram,,
