 CITATION extracted translation pairs by mining web anchor texts and link structures,,
 As an alternative, mixed-language web pages are exploited by first retrieving texts including both source and target languages from the web by using a search engine or simple rules, and then extracting translation pairs from the mixed-language texts utilizing various clues: CITATION used cooccurrence statistics, CITATION used cooccurrences and context similarity information, and CITATION used phonetic, semantic and frequency-distance features,,
 problems of high computational cost CITATION, sensitivity to parameters CITATION, low accuracy (CITATION; CITATION), and ineffectiveness for language pairs with 1 Although Vulic et al,,
 24 \x0cdifferent types of characters (CITATION; CITATION; Daume III and Jagarlamudi, 2011),,
 In face of the above problems, we propose a novel method that uses a graph-based label propagation technique CITATION,,
 To obtain co-occurrence relations with all the seeds, including indirect relations, we focus on a graph-based label propagation (LP) technique CITATION,,
