 High-performance taggers typically also include joint three-tag counts in some way, either as tag trigrams CITATION or tag-triple features (CITATION, CITATION),,
 \x0cgests that the final accuracy number presented here could be slightly improved upon by classifier combination, it is worth noting that not only is this tagger better than any previous single tagger, but it also appears to outperform CITATION, the best-known combination tagger (they report an accuracy of 97,,

 Words surrounding the current word have been occasionally used in taggers, such as CITATION, Brills transformation based tagger CITATION, and the HMM model of CITATION, but nevertheless, the only lexicalization consistently included in tagging models is the dependence of the part of speech tag of a word on the word itself,,

 While modern taggers may be more principled than the classic CLAWS tagger CITATION, they are in some respects inferior in their use of lexical information: CLAWS, through its IDIOMTAG module, categorically captured many important, correct taggings of frequent idiomatic word sequences,,

 Whereas CITATION used feature support cutoffs and early stopping to stop overfitting of the model, and CITATION contends that including low support features harms a maximum entropy model, our results show that low support features are useful in a regularized maximum entropy model,,

 Figure 3 gives pseudocode for the concrete case of the network in figure 1(d); the general case is similar, and is in fact just a max-plus version of standard inference algorithms for Bayes nets (CITATION, 97),,

 An interesting example of a common tagging error of the simpler models which could be corrected by a deterministic fixup rule of the kind used in the IDIOMTAG module of CITATION is the expression as X as (often, as far as),,
