For example, languages with a case system use different forms of the same word to mark different syntactic (or semantic) relations CITATION,,
In many languages, two words that participate in a syntactic relation show covariance in some or all of their morphological features (so-called agreement, CITATION).3 Automatic annotation of morphology assigns morphological descriptions (e,,
It is usually modeled as a sequence model, often in combination with part-of-speech tagging and lemmatization (CITATION; CITATION; CITATION; Chrupaa et al., 2008, and others),,

For all matters of syntactic annotation in this paper, we use the graph-based dependency parser by CITATION, also included in mate-tools,,

Morphological features co-vary between two items in the sentence, but the relation between these items can occur at various linguistic levels CITATION,,
We use the brute-force algorithm described in CITATION, which selects for each token in the sentence another token as the head,,

For all matters of syntactic annotation in this paper, we use the graph-based dependency parser by CITATION, also included in mate-tools,,

For Hungarian, we use the Szeged Dependency Treebank CITATION, with the split of CITATION,,
Modeling morphosyntactic relations explicitly has been shown to improve statistical parsing models (CITATION; CITATION; CITATION), but the codependency between morphology and syntax makes it a difficult problem, and linguistic intuition is often contradicted by the empirical findings,,
For example, CITATION show that case information is the most helpful morphological feature for parsing Arabic, but only if it is given as gold information, whereas using case information from an automatic system may even harm the performance,,
