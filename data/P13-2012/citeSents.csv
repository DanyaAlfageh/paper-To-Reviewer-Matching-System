The first work on event coreference dates back to CITATION,,
More recently, this task has been considered by CITATION and CITATION,,
Another view of predicate disambiguation seeks to link or align predicate argument tuples to an existing anchored resource containing references to events or actions, similar to anchored entity disambiguation (entity linking) (CITATION; Han and Sun, 2011),,
The most relevant, and perhaps only, work in this area is that of CITATION who linked predicates across document,,

The most relevant, and perhaps only, work in this area is that of CITATION who linked predicates across document pairs, measuring the F1 of aligned pairs,,
Extended Event Coreference Bank Based on the dataset of CITATION, CITATION introduced the Extended Event Coreference Bank (EECB) to evaluate cross-document event coreference,,
For the RF dataset, we follow CITATION and CITATION and evaluate on a version of F1 that considers SURE and POSSIBLE links, which are available in the RF data,,
For extra training data, we pool material from different datasets and use the multi-domain split feature space approach to learn dataset specific behaviors CITATION,,
