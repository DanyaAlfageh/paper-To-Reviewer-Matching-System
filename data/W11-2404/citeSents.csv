2 Coping with configurability EDITS CITATION is an open source RTE package, which offers a modular, flexible, and adaptable working environment to experiment with the RTE task over different datasets,,
As recently shown by the EDITS developers team, such situation results in running a limited number of experiments with the most reasonable configurations, which consequently might not lead to the optimal solution CITATION,,
For instance, in RTE6 dataset, the guessed configuration CITATION was based on the lexical overlap algorithm, setting the cost of replacing H terms without an equivalent in T to the minimal Levenshtein distance between such words and any word in T,,
A key feature of EDITS is represented by its high configurability, allowed by the availability of different algorithms, the possibility to integrate different sets of lexical entailment/contradiction rules, and the variety of parameters for performance optimization (see also CITATION),,
