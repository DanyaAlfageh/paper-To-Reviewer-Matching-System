5.2 Experiments on Opinion Target Extraction For performance evaluation on opinion target extraction, we compare our work (and also the non-propagation version, i.e., extracting targets using only the opinion words) with those in CITATION, henceforth Hu) and CITATION, henceforth Popescu), which also considered only explicit noun targets and experimented with the same data sets.,,
Additionally, we experimented with the popular topic modeling algorithm PLSA CITATION, using a public domain program,5 and CRF (CRF-D) using the toolkit CRF++.,,
Two fundamental problems in opinion mining are opinion lexicon expansion and opinion target extraction (CITATION; CITATION).,,

We consider opinion words to be adjectives and targets to be nouns/noun phrases, which has been widely adopted in previous work (CITATION; CITATION; CITATION).,,
The reason for using the frequency-based pruning is that although reviewers usually have different things to say, when they comment on the same product features, they tend to use similar words CITATION.,,
We use the customer review collection3 from CITATION as the testing data.,,
The seed opinion lexicon is also provided by CITATION,,,
