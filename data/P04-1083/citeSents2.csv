We shall limit our attention to MTGs in Generalized Chomsky Normal Form (GCNF) CITATION,,
The vehicle for the present guided tour shall be multitext grammar (MTG), which is a generalization of context-free grammar to the synchronous case CITATION,,
This normal form allows simpler algorithm descriptions than the normal forms used by CITATION and CITATION,,
