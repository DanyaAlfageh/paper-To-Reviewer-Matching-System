 ago CITATION, but here we articulate it in more detail: ordinary parsing is a special case of synchronous parsing, which is a special case of translation,,
 Parser C is conceptually simpler than the synchronous parsers of CITATION, CITATION, and CITATION, because it uses only one kind of item, and it never composes terminals,,
 CITATION shows how a parsing logic can be combined with various semirings to compute different kinds ,,
 Bootstrapping a PMTG from a lower-dimensional PMTG and a word-to-word translation model is similar in spirit to the way that regular grammars can help to estimate CFGs CITATION, and the way that simple translation models can help to bootstrap more sophisticated ones CITATION,,
 6 Although most of the literature discusses word translation models between only two languages, it is possible to combine several 2D models into a higher-dimensional model CITATION,,
 We presume that readers are familiar with declarative descriptions of inference algorithms, as well as with semiring parsing CITATION,,
 As in CITATIONs Parser A, Parser Cs items consist of a -dimensional label vector \x02213 and a -dimensional d-span vector 4 13 ,,
 See CITATION for definitions of cardinality, d-span, and the operators 9 and : ,,

 CITATION shows how a parsing logic can be combined with various semirings to compute different kinds of information about the input,,
 Under the various derivation semirings CITATION, Translator CT can store the output role templates \x1c ) 0 1 3 in each internal node of the tree,,
 To the best of our knowledge, Logic CT is the first published translation logic to be compatible with all of the semirings catalogued by CITATION, among others,,
 For example, we could project a part-of-speech tagger CITATION to improve our estimates in Equation 6,,
, CITATION; Meyers, 1996; Wu, 1998; CITATION),,
 Under such an MTG, the logic of word alignment is the one in CITATIONs Parser A, but without Compose inferences,,
 This logic can be used with the expectation semiring CITATION to find the maximum likelihood estimates of the parameters of a word-to-word translation model,,

 One application is inducing a parser in one language from a parser in another CITATION,,

 The vehicle for the present guided tour shall be multitext grammar (MTG), which is a generalization of context-free grammar to the synchronous case CITATION,,
 We shall limit our attention to MTGs in Generalized Chomsky Normal Form (GCNF) CITATION,,

 For example, CITATION showed how to reduce the computational complexity of a synchronous parser by \x07 \x17 3 \x18 , just by changing the logic,,

 Translator CT can take advantage of such information without making the strong independence assumptions of CITATION,,
