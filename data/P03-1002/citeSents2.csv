CITATION report the results listed on the first line of Table 2,,
For this reason we used the C5 inductive decision tree learning algorithm CITATION to implement both the classifier that identifies argument constituents and the classifier that labels arguments with their roles,,
2.2 The Model In previous work using the PropBank corpus, CITATION proposed a model predicting argument roles using the same statistical method as the one employed by CITATION for predicting semantic roles based on the FrameNet corpus CITATION,,
CITATION,,
To achieve high accuracy and resolve the data sparsity problem the method reported in (CITATION; CITATION) employed a backoff solution based on a lattice that combines the model features,,
One such augmented parser, trained on data available from the PropBank project has been recently presented in CITATION,,
Our model considers two sets of features: Feature Set 1 (FS1): features used in the work reported in CITATION and CITATION ; and Feature Set 2 (FS2): a novel set of features introduced in this paper,,

This statistical technique of labeling predicate argument operates on the output of the probabilistic parser reported \x0cin CITATION,,
For example, the backoff lattice in CITATION consists of eight connected nodes for a five-feature set,,
In this paper we describe a domain-independent IE paradigm that is based on predicate-argument structures identified automatically by two different methods: (1) the statistical method reported in CITATION; and (2) a new method based on inductive learning which obtains 17% higher Fscore over the first method when tested on the same data,,
