On the other hand, event as a high-level construct has proved useful in MDS content selection (CITATION; CITATION),,
The second metric we use is the Average Continuity (AC) developed by CITATION, which captures the intuition that the ordering quality can be estimated by the number of correctly arranged continuous sentences,,
For event terms, we first find the root verbs of deverbal nouns and then measure verb similarity by using the fine-grained relations provided by VerbOcean CITATION, which has proved useful in summarization CITATION,,
But unlike CITATION, we count in all the verb relations except antonymy because considering two antonymous verbs as similar is counterintuitive,,

1 Introduction One of the crucial steps in multi-document summarization (MDS) is information ordering, right after content selection and before sentence realization (CITATION:832 834),,
Recent researches in this direction mostly focus on local coherence by studying lexical cohesion CITATION or entity overlap and transition CITATION,,
A solution to this problem in an effort to leverage the latent event topics among eus is the Latent Semantic Analysis (LSA, CITATION) approach,,
A simple ordering criterion is the chronological order of the events represented in the sentences, which is often augmented with other ordering criteria such as lexical overlap CITATION, lexical cohesion CITATION or syntactic features CITATION,,

CITATION take the top 10 most frequent entities and CITATION ,,
CITATION define entity similarity as the number of shared entities, which may unfairly assign high scores to events with many entities in our model,,
For event terms, we first find the root verbs of deverbal nouns and then measure verb similarity by using the fine-grained relations provided by VerbOcean CITATION, which has proved useful in summarization CITATION,,
But unlike CITATION, we count in all the verb relations except antonymy because considering two antonymous verbs as similar is counterintuitive,,

CITATION use atomic events as conceptual representations in MDS content selection, followed by CITATION who treat event terms and named entities as graph nodes in their PageRank algor,,
But the anchor sentence did not come from nowhere and in order to find its best successor, we should also seek clues from its source context, which is inspired by the sentence precedence by CITATION,,
Based on CITATION, we assign 0.2 to the Establish and Continue transitions, 0.1 to Smooth Shift and Retain, and 0 to other centering transitions,,
