Researchers would like to be able to search this huge textbase for biomedical correlations such as protein-protein or gene-disease associations (CITATION; CITATION; CITATION),,
2.3 Structural search algorithms Search algorithms for structured texts have been studied extensively, and examples include XML databases with XPath CITATION and XQuery CITATION, and region algebra (Clarke et al., 1995),,
The present study focuses on region algebra extended with variables CITATION because it provides an efficient search algorithm for tags with cross boundaries,,
For biomedical terms other than genes/gene products, the Unified Medical Language System (UMLS) meta-thesaurus CITATION is a large database that contains various names of biomedical and health-related concepts,,
2.2 Parsing technologies Recently, state-of-the-art CFG parsers CITATION can compute phrase structures of natural sentences at fairly high accuracy,,
In addition, parsers that compute deeper analyses, such as predicate argument structures, have become available for 1018 \x0cthe processing of real-world sentences CITATION,,
Figure 1 shows an output of an HPSG parser CITATION for the sentence A normal serum CRP measure,,

3.1 Off-line processing: HPSG parsing and term recognition We first parsed all sentences using an HPSG parser CITATION to obtain their predicate argument structures,,
Because our target is biomedical texts, we re-trained a parser CITATION with the GENIA treebank CITATION, and also applied a bidirectional part-ofspeech tagger CITATION trained with the GENIA treebank as a preprocessor,,
In order to effectively use such an environment, GXP CITATION was used to connect these clusters and distribute the load among them,,
Apart from IE research, enrichment of texts with various annotations has been proposed and is becoming a new research area for information management (CITATION; TEI, 2004),,
For example, GENA CITATION is a database of genes and gene products that is semi-automatically collected from well-known databases, including HUGO, OMIM, Genatlas, Locuslink, GDB, MGI, FlyBase, WormBase, Figure 1: An output of HPSG parsing Figure 2: A predicate argument structure CYGD, and SGD,,

2.2 Parsing technologies Recently, state-of-the-art CFG parsers CITATION can compute phrase structures of natural sentences at fairly high accuracy,,
We first apply a deep parser CITATION and a dictionary-based term recognizer CITATION to MEDLINE and obtain annotations of predicate argument structures and ontological identifiers of genes, gene products, diseases, and events,,
User requests are converted into queries of region algebra (Clarke et al., 1995) extended with variables CITATION on these annotations,,
