Web search can be enhanced in powerful ways if to-
ken spans in Web text are annotated with disambiguated
entities from large catalogs like Freebase. Entity anno-
tators need to be trained on sample mention snippets.
Wikipedia entities and annotated pages offer high-quality
labeled data for training and evaluation. Unfortunately,
Wikipedia features only one-ninth the number of enti-
ties as Freebase, and these are a highly biased sample
of well-connected, frequently mentioned head entities.
To bring hope to tail entities, we broaden our goal to a
second task: assigning types to entities in Freebase but
not Wikipedia. The two tasks are synergistic: know-
ing the types of unfamiliar entities helps disambiguate
mentions, and words in mention contexts help assign
types to entities. We present TMI, a bipartite graphical
model for joint type-mention inference. TMI attempts
no schema integration or entity resolution, but exploits
the above-mentioned synergy. In experiments involving
780,000 people in Wikipedia, 2.3 million people in Free-
base, 700 million Web pages, and over 20 professional
editors, TMI shows considerable annotation accuracy im-
provement (e.g., 70%) compared to baselines (e.g., 46%),
especially for tail and emerging entities. We also com-
pare with Googles recent annotations of the same corpus
with Freebase entities, and report considerable improve-
ments within the people domain.

1 Introduction
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.996436807692308">
Thanks to automatic information extraction and se-
mantic Web efforts, keyword search over unstruc-
tured Web text is rapidly evolving toward entity-
and type-oriented queries (Guo et al., 2009; Pan-
tel et al., 2012) over semi-structured databases such
as Wikipedia, Freebase, and other forms of Linked
Data.
A key enabling component for such enhanced
search capability is a type and entity catalog. This
includes a directed acyclic graph of types under the
subTypeOf relation between types, and entities at-
tached to one or more types via instanceOf edges.
soumen@cse.iitb.ac.in
YAGO (Suchanek et al., 2007) provides such a cat-
alog by unifying Wikipedia and WordNet, followed
by some cleanup.
Another enabling component is an annotated cor-
pus in which token spans (e.g., the word Albert)
are identified as a mention of an entity (e.g., the
Physicist Einstein). Equipped with suitable indices,
a catalog and an annotated corpus let us find sci-
entists who played some musical instrument, and
answer many other powerful classes of queries (Li
et al., 2010; Sawant and Chakrabarti, 2013).
Consequently, accurate corpus annotation has
been intensely investigated (Mihalcea and Csomai,
2007; Cucerzan, 2007; Milne and Witten, 2008;
Kulkarni et al., 2009; Han et al., 2011; Ratinov et
al., 2011; Hoffart et al., 2011). With two exceptions
(Zheng et al., 2012; Gabrilovich et al., 2013) that we
discuss later, public-domain corpus annotation work
has almost exclusively used Wikipedia and deriva-
tives, partly because Wikipedia provides not only a
standardized space of entities, but also reliably la-
beled mention text within its own documents, which
can be used to train machine learning algorithms for
entity disambiguation.
However, the high quality of Wikipedia comes
at the cost of low entity coverage (4.2 million)
and bias toward often-mentioned, richly-connected
head entities. Hereafter, Wikipedia entities are
called W. Freebase has fewer editorial controls, but
has at least nine times as many entities. This is par-
ticularly perceptible for people entities: one needs
to be relatively famous to be featured on Wikipedia,
but Freebase is less selective. Hereafter, Freebase
entities are called F.
As in any heavy-tailed distribution, even rela-
tively obsecure entities from F \\ W are collectively
mentioned a great many times on the Web, and in-
cluding them in Web annotation is critical, if entity-
oriented search is to impact the vast number of tail

\x0cqueries submitted to Web search engines.
Primary goal corpus annotation: We have
thus established a pressing need to bootstrap from a
small entity catalog W (such as Wikipedia entities),
and a small reference corpus CW (e.g., Wikipedia
text) reliably annotated with entities from W, to a
much larger catalog F (e.g., Freebase), and an open-
domain large payload corpus C (e.g., the Web).
We can and will use entities in F W1 in the
bootstrapping process, but the real challenge is to
annotate C with mentions m of entities in F \\ W.
Unlike for F W, we have no training mentions for
F \\ W. Therefore, the main disambiguation signal
is from the immediate entity neighborhood N(e) of
the candidate entity e in the Freebase graph. I.e., if
m also reliably mentions some entity in N(e), then
e becomes a stronger candidate. Unfortunately, for
many tail entities e F \\ W, N(e) is sparse. Is
there hope for annotating the Web with tail entities?
Here, we achieve enhanced accuracy for the primary
annotation goal by extending it with a related sec-
ondary goal.
Secondary goal entity typing: If we had avail-
able a suitable type catalog T with associated enti-
ties in W, which in turn have known textual men-
tions, we can build models of contexts referring to
types like chemists, sports people and politicans.
When faced with people called John Williams in
F \\W, we may first try to associate them with types.
This can then help disambiguate mentions to specific
instances of John Williams in F \\ W. In principle,
useful information may also flow in the reverse di-
rection: words in mention contexts may help assign
types to entities in F \\ W. For reasons to be made
clear, we choose YAGO (Suchanek et al., 2007) as
the type catalog T accompanying entities in W.
Our contributions: We present TMI, a bootstrap-
ping system for solving the two tasks jointly. Apart
from matches between the context of m and entity
names in N(e), TMI combines and balances evi-
dence from two other sources to decide if e is men-
tioned at token span m, and has type t:
a language model for the context in which enti-
ties of type t are usually mentioned

correlations between t and certain path features
generated from N(e).
TMI uses a novel probabilistic graphical model for-
mulation to integrate these signals. We give a de-
tailed account of our design of node and edge po-
tentials, and a natural reject option (recall/precision
tradeoff).
We report on extensive experiments using YAGO
types, Wikipedia entities and text, Freebase en-
tities, and text from ClueWeb122, a 700-million-
page Web corpus. We focus on all people enti-
ties in Wikipedia and Freebase, and provide three
kinds of evaluation. First, we evaluate TMI on over
1100 entities in F W and 5500 snippets from
Wikipedia text, where it visibly improves upon base-
lines and a recently proposed alternative method
(Zheng et al., 2012). Second, we resort to exten-
sive manual evaluation of annotation on ClueWeb12
Web text with Freebase entities, by professional ed-
itors at a commercial search company. TMI again
clearly outperforms strong baselines, doing partic-
ularly well for nascent or tail entities. TMI im-
proves per-snippet accuracy, for some classes of
entities, from 46% to 70%, and pooled F1 score
from 66% to 73%. Third, we compare TMI an-
notations with Googles FACC1 (Gabrilovich et al.,
2013) annotations restricted to people; TMI is sig-
nificantly better. Our annotations and related data
can be downloaded from http://www.cse.iit
b.ac.in/ soumen/doc/CSAW/. To our knowl-
edge, this is among the first reports on extensive hu-
man evaluation of machine annotation for F \\ W on
a large Web corpus.

of emerging entities (related to our secondary goal).
In concurrent work, (Nakashole et al., 2013) pro-
pose integer linear program formulations for infer-
ring types of emerging entities from the way their
mentions are embedded in curated relation-revealing
phrases. (Lin et al., 2012) earlier approached the
problem using weight propagation in a bipartite
graph connecting unknown to known entities via
textual relation patterns. Both note that this can
boost mention disambiguation accuracy.
The closest work to ours is by (Zheng et al.,
2012): they use semisupervised learning to anno-
tate a corpus with Freebase entities. Like (Milne
and Witten, 2008), they depend on unambiguous
entity-mention pairs to bootstrap a classifier, then
apply it to unlabeled, ambiguous mentions, creating
more training data. They use a per-type language
model like us (3.3), but this is used as a secondary
cause for (word) feature generation, supplementing
and smoothing entity-specific language models. In
contrast, we use a rigorous graphical model to com-
bine new signals, not depending on naturally unam-
biguous mentions. Finally, in the interest of fully
automated evaluation, they limit their experiments
to F W and Wikipedia corpus, thus differing crit-
ically from our human evaluation on F and a Web
corpus.
(Gabrilovich et al., 2013) have recently released
FACC1: annotations of ClueWeb09 and ClueWeb12
with Freebase entities. Their algorithm is not yet
public. They report: Due to the sheer size of the
data, it was not possible to verify all the automatic
annotations manually. Based on a small-scale hu-
man evaluation, the precision ... is believed to be
around 8085%. Estimating the recall is of course
difficult; however, it is believed to be around 70-
85%. In 5, we will see that, for people entities,
TMI greatly increases recall beyond FACC1, keep-
ing precision unimpaired.

flux, Freebase shows less editorial uniformity than
Wikipedia. This shows up in missing or non-
standard relation edges. Unlike YAGO, where

have small, uninformative graph neighborhoods.
Also shown are three mention contexts, each rep-
resented by the snippet immediately surrounding the
mention, and salient words from the documents con-
taining each snippet. (Salient words may be ex-
tracted as words that contribute the largest compo-
nents to the document represented as a TFIDF vec-
tor.) (a) shows a favorable but relatively rare case
where e = 0ggbn2k has reliable type links. We can-
not assume there will be a 1-to-1 correspondence be-
tween Freebase and YAGO types, but in 3.2 we will
describe how to learn associations between Freebase
paths around entities and their YAGO types. The
snippet and salient words show reasonable overlap
with N(e). In 3.4 we will describe features that
characterize such overlap. In (b), e = 03nmvfz
is reliably typed, but there is no direct match be-
tween N(e) and the snippet. Nevertheless, the snip-
pet can be reliably annotated with 03nmvfz if we
can learn associations between types American foot-
ball player and Athlete (or their approximate YAGO
target types) and several context/salient words (see
3.3). In (c), e = 0bhbqmm is not reliably typed.
However, there are matches between N(e) and con-
text/salient words. Once the snippet-to-entity asso-
ciation is established, it is easier to assign 0bhbqmm
to suitable types in YAGO.
In this section we will first describe our design of
the target type space, and then the tree signals that
will be used in our joint inference.

By typing two people called John Williams as ac-

mentions accurately. Therefore, we need a well-
organized type space where the types
collectively cover most entities of interest,
offer reasonable type prediction accuracy, and
can be selected algorithmically, for any do-
main.
Wikipedia and Freebase have many obscure types
like people born in 1937 or artists from On-
tario which satisfy none of the above requirements.
YAGO, on the other hand, has a clean hierarchy of

There will generally not be a simple mapping be-

may be known as a Mayor in Freebase, but the
closest YAGO type may be Politician. Edge and
node labels from the Freebase graph neighborhood
N(e) can embed many clues for assigning e a target

Two further refinements are needed to make this
work. First, we have to collect path labels around
negative instances we well, and submit positive and

types. Second, indiscriminate expansion around e is
infeasible because the Freebase graph has very small
diameter. Even after substantial pruning, paths of
length 3 and 4 reach over 40% and 96% of all nodes
(Fig. 3). This increases computational burden and
floods us with noisy and spurious paths. We rem-
edy the problem using an idea from PathRank (Lao
and Cohen, 2010). Instead of trying to explore all
paths originating (or terminating) at e, where e may
or may not belong to a target type, we focus on paths
between e and other known members of the target
type.

3.3 Type language model
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.990810838709677">
To exploit the second signal, shown in Fig. 1(b), we
need to model the association between target YAGO
types and the mention contexts of Wikipedia entities
known to belong to those types. This model compo-
nent is in the same spirit as (Zheng et al., 2012).
For each target YAGO type t, we sample positive
entities e F W, and for each e, we collect, from
Wikipedia annotated text, a corpus of snippets men-
tioning e. We remove the mention words and retain
the rest. We also collect salient words from the en-
tire Wikipedia document containing the snippet, as
shown in Fig. 1.
At this point each target type is associated with
a corpus of contexts, each represented by snippet
words. We compute the IDF of all words in this
corpus3, and then represent each type as a TFIDF
vector (Salton and McGill, 1983). A test context is
turned into a similar vector, and its score with re-
spect to t is the cosine between these two vectors.
This simple approach was found superior to building
a more traditional smoothed multinomial unigram
model (Zhai, 2008) for each type. Given the output
of this component feeds into an outer discriminative
inference mechanism, a strict probabilistic model is
not necessary.
3.4 Entity neighborhood match with snippet
The third signal is a staple of any disambiguation
work: match the occurrence context against the
neighborhood in the structured representation. In
word sense disambiguation (WSD), support for as-
signing a word in context to a synset comes from

matches between, say, other words in the context and
the WordNet neighborhood of the proposed synset.
As in WSD, many approaches to Wikification mea-
sure some local consistency between a mention m
and the neighborhood N(e) of a candidate entity e.
N(e) is again limited by a maximum path length `.
From snippet m we extract all phrases P(m) exclud-
ing the mention words. For each phrase p P(m),

We now present a unified model that combines the
signals and solves the two proposed tasks jointly.
We model two kinds of decision variables, which
will be represented by nodes in a graphical model.
Associated with each entity e F \\ W there is a
hidden type variable (node) Te, which can take on a
value from (some subset of) the type catalog T . As-
sociated with each mention m (along with its snip-

a hidden entity variable Em, which can take on val-
ues from some subset of entities. (For simplicity, we
assume that entities in F W have already been an-
notated in the corpus, and no m of interest mentions
such entities.)

model developed in 3.3.
If e is among the set of values Em that Em can
take, then nodes Te and Em are joined by an edge.
This edge is associated with an edge potential table
e,m : Te Em R+. e,m(, e0) will be set to zero

is set to the cosine match score described in 3.3.

An algorithm may reject many snippets, i.e., refrain
from annotating them. This could be because the
snippet mentions an entity outside F (and outside
W), or the system wishes to ensure high precision at
some cost to recall.
Rejection is modeled by adding, for each snippet
m, a pseudo or null entity m (also called no an-

\x0cnotation NA, null or nil in the TAC-KBP5 commu-
nity). For simplicity, we assume that m and m0
are incomparable or distinct for m 6= m0. I.e., we
do not offer to cluster mentions of unknown enti-
ties. These remain separate, unconnected nodes in
the (augmented) Freebase graph.
If we choose Em = m, we get zero credit for
matching non-mention text in m to N(m), because
N(m) = and 3.4 has no information to con-
tribute. I.e., we set m(m) = 0. In general,
m() 0, so m gets the lowest possible credit
(but this will be modified shortly).
There is also a type variable Tm . To what type
should we assign entity m? Because m has no
connections in the Freebase graph, no hint can come
from 3.2. Put differently, m (t) will be constant
(say, zero) for all snippets m and types t.
Even if we do not know the entity mentioned in
m, the non-mention text in m will have differential
affinity to different types, obtained from 3.3. This
means that, if Em = m is chosen, Tm will be
arg maxt m,m(t, m), which explains the non-
mention words in m using the best available lan-
guage model associated with some type. For a dif-
ferent entity Em = e0 and type Te0 = t assign-
ment to win, m(e0)+e0 (t)+e0,m(t, e0) must
exceed the null score above. This provides a us-
able recall/precision handle: we modify m(m) to
a tuned number; making it smaller generally gives
higher recall and lower precision.

4.4 Inference and training

<bodyText confidence="0.996060615384616">
The goal of collective inference will be to assign a
type value to each Te and an entity value to each
Em. We seek the maximum a-posteriori (MAP) la-
bel, for which we use tree-reweighted message pass-
ing (TRW-S) (Kolmogorov, 2006). Our graph has
plenty of bipartite cycles, so inference is approxi-
mate. Given the sparsity of data, we preferred to
delexicalize our objective (1), i.e., avoid word-level
features and pre-aggregate their signals via time-
tested aggregators (such as TFIDF cosine). As a re-
sult we have only two free parameters , in (1),
which we tune via grid search. A more principled
training regimen is left for future work.

We focus our experiments on one broad type of en-
tities, people, that is more challenging for disam-
biguators than typical showcase examples of distin-
guishing (Steve) Jobs from employment and Apple
Inc. from fruit.
We report on three sets of experiments. In 5.1,
we restrict to entities from F W and Wikipedia
text, for which ground truth annotation is avail-
able. In 5.2, we evaluate TMI and baselines on
ClueWeb12 and entities from Freebase, not lim-
ited to Wikipedia. In 5.3, we compare TMI
with Googles recently published FACC1 annota-
tions (Gabrilovich et al., 2013).

For these reasons, the few known systems for
Freebase-based annotation (Zheng et al., 2012) are
evaluated exclusively on F W.

<bodyText confidence="0.987282428571429">
People in F W are known by one or more men-
tion words/phrases. From these, we collect mention
phrases along with the candidate entity set for each
phrase. The number of candidates is the phrases de-
gree of ambiguity. We sort phrases by ambiguity and
draw a sample over the ambiguity range. This gives
us seed phrases with representative ambiguity. Then
we collect all entities mentioned by these phrases.
Overall we collect about 1100 entities and 5500 dis-
tinct mentions.
Contrast this with (Zheng et al., 2012), who sam-
ple entities from much fewer than 130, and largely
well-separated types: professional athletes, aca-
demics, actors, films, books, hotels, and tourist at-
tractions. If there were only two namesakes, an ac-
tor and a politician, the politician disappears, leav-
ing a naturally unambiguous alias. I.e., (Zheng et
al., 2012) did not complete their entity sets with
aliased entities. For all these reasons, Z0 numbers
here are not directly comparable to those in their pa-
per.

\x0c5.1.2 Tasks and baselines
The structure of TMI suggests two natural base-
lines to compare against it. TMI solves two tasks si-
multaneously: assign types to entities and entities to
snippets. So the first baseline, T0, is one that solves
the typing task separately, and the second, A0, does
snippet annotation separately. A third baseline, Z0,
from (Zheng et al., 2012) does only snippet annota-
tion; they do not consider typing entities.
While evaluating types output by TMI and T0
against ground truth, we may wish to assign partial
credit for overlapping types, e.g., athlete vs. soccer
player, because our types form an incomplete hierar-
chy. We use the standard M&amp;W score of semantic
similarity between types (Milne and Witten, 2008)
for this.
As regards snippet annotation, Z0 (Zheng et al.,
2012) does not specify any mechanism for han-
dling . Therefore we run two sets of experiments.
In one we eliminate all snippets with ground truth
. A0, and TMI are also debarred from returning
for any snippet. In the other, snippets marked in
ground truth are included. A0 and TMI are enabled

Z0s performance here is worse than in (Zheng et
al., 2012). This is explained by our much larger and
difficult-to-separate type system.
We disaggregate the summary results into buck-
ets, shown in Fig. 8. Each bucket covers a range of
degrees of entity nodes in Freebase, while roughly
balacing the number of snippets in each bucket. TMI
generally shows larger gains for low-degree buckets.
5.1.4 Type prediction results
We also compared the type inference accuracy of
TMI and T0; (Zheng et al., 2012) do not infer types.
The summary is in Fig. 9. Two uninformed baselines
are worth mentioning. Uniform random choice over
130 types gave only 2% accuracy. Chossing the type
with largest prior probability gave 28.2% accuracy.
TMI is much better, but offers no significant ben-
efit (or degradation) compared to T0. We verified,
partly by way of debugging, that there do exist enti-
ties e with small degree but a modest number of as-
signed snippets, for which snippet-to-N(e) matches

mentions, and their type and entity neighborhoods
may be sparse. Furthermore, compared to the closed
world of F W, evaluating TMI and baselines over
C and F \\ W is challenging. Entities in F \\ W
do not have ground truth types in the type catalog
T (here, YAGO), nor snippets labeled by humans as
mentioning them. Therefore, we need human edi-
torial judgment, which is scarce. Even though TMI
can be applied at Web scale, the scale if evaluation
is limited by editorial input.

Some phrases in Figs. 10 and 11 have overwhelm-
ing numbers of pages with matches. In produc-
tion, we naturally want all of them to be annotated.
But human editorial judgment being the bottleneck,
we sampled 50% or 50,000 snippets, whichever was
smaller. Starting with about 752,450 pages, we ran
the Stanford NER (Finkel et al., 2005) to mark per-
son spans. Pages with fewer than five non-person to-
kens per person were discarded; this effectively dis-
carded long list pages without any informative text
to disambiguate anyone, and left us with 574,135
pages. From these we collected 304,309 snippets
where the mention phrase is marked by the NER as
a person. Each seed phrase leads to one cluster on
which TMI and A0 are run. Note that must be

bias. Because the editors are trained professionals
(unlike Mechanical Turks), we increased our evalu-
ation coverage by having each type or entity assign-
ment reviewed by one editor.
Pooling: Ideally, editors can be asked to find the
best type or entity for each entity or snippet, but,
given the size and diversity of Freebase, the cogni-
tive burden would be unacceptable. In the Wikipedia
corpus CW , a snippet marked (no entity) by an al-
gorithm can be judged a loss of recall if Wikipedia
ground truth annotates it with an entity. Unfortu-
nately, this is no longer practical for Web corpus C,
because 8,217 snippets marked would have to be
manually inspected and compared with a large num-
ber of candidate entities in Freebase. Therefore, we
adopt pooling as in TREC. (Although the pool is
small, A0 has very high recall.) Recall is evaluated
with respect to the union of snippets annoted with a
non- entity by at least one competing algorithm,
with agreement in case of more than one.
0/1 Type accuracy: Editors judged each pro-
posed type as correct or not. Unlike in 5.1, where
the true and proposed types could be compared via
M&amp;W (Milne and Witten, 2008), they could not be
asked to objectively estimate relatedness between
types. Therefore we present only their reported post-
hoc 0/1 accuracy for types: T0 and TMI have 0/1
type accuracy of 0.828 and 0.818.

Results are shown in Fig. 15. In a large 40% of
cases, TMI labels correctly while FACC1 backs off.
The converse, where FACC1 backs off and TMI
makes a mistake, is about half as frequent. These
preliminary numbers suggest that TMI is able to
push recall beyond FACC1 while also giving better
precision.

We presented a formal model for bootstrapping from
YAGO types and entities annotated in Wikipedia to
two tasks, 1. annotating Web snippets with Freebase
entities, and 2. associating Freebase entities with
YAGO types. We presented TMI, a system to solve
the two tasks jointly. Experiments show that TMIs
snippet annotation accuracy, especially for relatively
weakly-connected Freebase entities, is superior to
baselines. We aim to extend from people to all major
Freebase categories, and larger Web crawls.

<abstract confidence="0.997696296296297">Web search can be enhanced in powerful ways if token spans in Web text are annotated with disambiguated entities from large catalogs like Freebase. Entity annotators need to be trained on sample mention snippets. Wikipedia entities and annotated pages offer high-quality labeled data for training and evaluation. Unfortunately, Wikipedia features only one-ninth the number of entities as Freebase, and these are a highly biased sample of well-connected, frequently mentioned head entities. To bring hope to tail entities, we broaden our goal to a second task: assigning types to entities in Freebase but not Wikipedia. The two tasks are synergistic: knowing the types of unfamiliar entities helps disambiguate mentions, and words in mention contexts help assign types to entities. We present TMI, a bipartite graphical model for joint type-mention inference. TMI attempts no schema integration or entity resolution, but exploits the above-mentioned synergy. In experiments involving 780,000 people in Wikipedia, 2.3 million people in Freebase, 700 million Web pages, and over 20 professional editors, TMI shows considerable annotation accuracy improvement (e.g., 70%) compared to baselines (e.g., 46%), especially for tail and emerging entities. We also compare with Googles recent annotations of the same corpus with Freebase entities, and report considerable improvements within the people domain.</abstract>

Second, we resort to extensive manual evaluation of annotation on ClueWeb12 Web text with Freebase entities, by professional editors at a commercial search company. TMI again clearly outperforms strong baselines, doing particularly well for nascent or tail entities. TMI improves per-snippet accuracy, for some classes of entities, from 46% to 70%, and pooled F1 score from 66% to 73%.

They use a per-type language model like us (3.3), but this is used as a secondary cause for (word) feature generation, supplementing and smoothing entity-specific language models. In contrast, we use a rigorous graphical model to combine new signals, not depending on naturally unambiguous mentions. Finally, in the interest of fully automated evaluation, they limit their experiments to F W and Wikipedia corpus, thus differing critically from our human evaluation on F and a Web corpus. (Gabrilovich et al., 2013) have recently released FACC1: annotations of ClueWeb09 and ClueWeb12 with Freebase entities. Their algorithm is not yet public. They report: Due to the sheer size of the data, it was not possible to verify all the automatic annotations manually. Based on a small-scale human evaluation, the precision ... is believed to be around 8085%. Estimating the recall is of course difficult; however, it is believed to be around 70- 85%. In 5, we will see that, for people entities, TMI greatly increases recall beyond FACC1, keeping precision unimpaired. 3 The three signals Fig. 1 shows three Freebase enti</context>

We report on three sets of experiments. In 5.1, we restrict to entities from F W and Wikipedia text, for which ground truth annotation is available. In 5.2, we evaluate TMI and baselines on ClueWeb12 and entities from Freebase, not limited to Wikipedia. In 5.3, we compare TMI with Googles recently published FACC1 annotations (Gabrilovich et al., 2013). 5.1 Reference corpus CW with F W entities Limited to people, |F |= 2323792, |W |= 807381, |F \\ W |= 1544942, and |F W |= 778850. It is easiest to evaluate TMI and others on Wikipedia entities. They have known YAGO types. Wikipedia text has explicit (disambiguated) entity annotations. For these reasons, the few known systems for Freebase-based annotation (Zheng et al., 2012) are evaluated exclusively on F W. 5.1.1 Seeding and setup People in F W are known by one or more mention words/phrases. From these, we collect mention phrases along with the candidate entity set for each phrase. The numb</context>

At the very low end of almost disconnected entity nodes, no algorithm does very well, because these entities are also hardly ever mentioned. When the entity is popular and well-connected, TMIs benefits are relatively modest. TMIs gains are best in the mid-range of degrees. The gap narrows for large-degree nodes, which is expected. 5.3 Comparison with FACC1 After collecting our pool of snippets as in 5.2.2, we consulted FACC1 (Gabrilovich et al., 2013), and passed on FACC1 annotations to our editors. As before, the identity of the algorithm was concealed. Results are shown in Fig. 15. In a large 40% of cases, TMI labels correctly while FACC1 backs off. The converse, where FACC1 backs off and TMI makes a mistake, is about half as frequent. These preliminary numbers suggest that TMI is able to push recall beyond FACC1 while also giving better precision. 445 \x0c6 Conclusion We presented a formal model for bootstrapping from YAGO types and entities annotated in Wikipedia to two tasks, 1. annotating Web snippets with Freebase entities, and 2. a</context>

For a different entity Em = e0 and type Te0 = t assignment to win, m(e0)+e0 (t)+e0,m(t, e0) must exceed the null score above. This provides a usable recall/precision handle: we modify m(m) to a tuned number; making it smaller generally gives higher recall and lower precision. 4.4 Inference and training The goal of collective inference will be to assign a type value to each Te and an entity value to each Em. We seek the maximum a-posteriori (MAP) label, for which we use tree-reweighted message passing (TRW-S) (Kolmogorov, 2006). Our graph has plenty of bipartite cycles, so inference is approximate. Given the sparsity of data, we preferred to delexicalize our objective (1), i.e., avoid word-level features and pre-aggregate their signals via timetested aggregators (such as TFIDF cosine). As a result we have only two free parameters , in (1), which we tune via grid search. A more principled training regimen is left for future work. 5 http://www.nist.gov/tac/2013/KBP/ 5 Experiments We focus our experiments on one broad type of entities, people, that is more challenging for disambiguators than typical showcase examples o</context>

First, we have to collect path labels around negative instances we well, and submit positive and negative path labels to a binary classifier to can439 \x0ccel the effect of frequent but non-informative path types. Second, indiscriminate expansion around e is infeasible because the Freebase graph has very small diameter. Even after substantial pruning, paths of length 3 and 4 reach over 40% and 96% of all nodes (Fig. 3). This increases computational burden and floods us with noisy and spurious paths. We remedy the problem using an idea from PathRank (Lao and Cohen, 2010). Instead of trying to explore all paths originating (or terminating) at e, where e may or may not belong to a target type, we focus on paths between e and other known members of the target type. 3.3 Type language model To exploit the second signal, shown in Fig. 1(b), we need to model the association between target YAGO types and the mention contexts of Wikipedia entities known to belong to those types. This model component is in the same spirit as (Zheng et al., 2012). For each target YAGO type t, we sample positive entities e F W, and for each e, we collect, from Wikipedia annotated text, a</context>

So the first baseline, T0, is one that solves the typing task separately, and the second, A0, does snippet annotation separately. A third baseline, Z0, from (Zheng et al., 2012) does only snippet annotation; they do not consider typing entities. While evaluating types output by TMI and T0 against ground truth, we may wish to assign partial credit for overlapping types, e.g., athlete vs. soccer player, because our types form an incomplete hierarchy. We use the standard M&amp;W score of semantic similarity between types (Milne and Witten, 2008) for this. As regards snippet annotation, Z0 (Zheng et al., 2012) does not specify any mechanism for handling . Therefore we run two sets of experiments. In one we eliminate all snippets with ground truth . A0, and TMI are also debarred from returning for any snippet. In the other, snippets marked in ground truth are included. A0 and TMI are enabled to return , but Z0 cannot.

Recall is evaluated with respect to the union of snippets annoted with a non- entity by at least one competing algorithm, with agreement in case of more than one. 0/1 Type accuracy: Editors judged each proposed type as correct or not.

For each target YAGO type t, we sample positive entities e F W, and for each e, we collect, from Wikipedia annotated text, a corpus of snippets mentioning e. We remove the mention words and retain the rest. We also collect salient words from the entire Wikipedia document containing the snippet, as shown in Fig. 1. At this point each target type is associated with a corpus of contexts, each represented by snippet words. We compute the IDF of all words in this corpus3, and then represent each type as a TFIDF vector (Salton and McGill, 1983). A test context is turned into a similar vector, and its score with respect to t is the cosine between these two vectors.

As in WSD, many approaches to Wikification measure some local consistency between a mention m and the neighborhood N(e) of a candidate entity e. N(e) is again limited by a maximum path length `. From snippet m we extract all phrases P(m) excluding the mention words. For each phrase p P(m), if p occurs at least once4 in any node of N(e), then we accumulate a credit of |p| P wp IDF(w), where w ranges over words in p, IDF(w) is its inverse document frequency (Salton and McGill, 1983) in Wikipedia, and |p |is the length of the phrase.

A key enabling component for such enhanced search capability is a type and entity catalog. This includes a directed acyclic graph of types under the subTypeOf relation between types, and entities attached to one or more types via instanceOf edges. soumen@cse.iitb.ac.in YAGO (Suchanek et al., 2007) provides such a catalog by unifying Wikipedia and WordNet, followed by some cleanup. Another enabling component is an annotated corpus in which token spans (e.g., the word Albert) are identified as a mention of an entity (e.g., the Physicist Einstein).

When faced with people called John Williams in F \\W, we may first try to associate them with types. This can then help disambiguate mentions to specific instances of John Williams in F \\ W. In principle, useful information may also flow in the reverse direction: words in mention contexts may help assign types to entities in F \\ W. For reasons to be made clear, we choose YAGO (Suchanek et al., 2007) as the type catalog T accompanying entities in W. Our contributions: We present TMI, a bootstrapping system for solving the two tasks jointly. Apart from matches between the context of m and entity names in N(e), TMI combines and balances evidence from two other sources to decide if e is mentioned at token span m, and has type t: a language model for the context in which entities of type t are usually mentioned 1 With F=Freebase and W=Wikipedia, F W W but not quite; W \\ F is small but non-empty. correlations between t and certain path features generated from N(e).

We give a detailed account of our design of node and edge potentials, and a natural reject option (recall/precision tradeoff). We report on extensive experiments using YAGO types, Wikipedia entities and text, Freebase entities, and text from ClueWeb122, a 700-millionpage Web corpus. We focus on all people entities in Wikipedia and Freebase, and provide three kinds of evaluation. First, we evaluate TMI on over 1100 entities in F W and 5500 snippets from Wikipedia text, where it visibly improves upon baselines and a recently proposed alternative method (Zheng et al., 2012). Second, we resort to extensive manual evaluation of annotation on ClueWeb12 Web text with Freebase entities, by professional editors at a commercial search company. TMI again clearly outperforms strong baselines, doing particularly well for nascent or tail entities. TMI improves per-snippet accuracy, for some classes of entities, from 46% to 70%, and pooled F1 score from 66% to 73%. Third, we compare TMI annotations with Googles FACC1 (Gabrilovich et al., 2013) annotations restricted to people; TMI is significantly better.

In concurrent work, (Nakashole et al., 2013) propose integer linear program formulations for inferring types of emerging entities from the way their mentions are embedded in curated relation-revealing phrases. (Lin et al., 2012) earlier approached the problem using weight propagation in a bipartite graph connecting unknown to known entities via textual relation patterns. Both note that this can boost mention disambiguation accuracy. The closest work to ours is by (Zheng et al., 2012): they use semisupervised learning to annotate a corpus with Freebase entities. Like (Milne and Witten, 2008), they depend on unambiguous entity-mention pairs to bootstrap a classifier, then apply it to unlabeled, ambiguous mentions, creating more training data. They use a per-type language model like us (3.3), but this is used as a secondary cause for (word) feature generation, supplementing and smoothing entity-specific language models. In contrast, we use a rigorous graphical model to combine new signals, not depending on naturally unambiguous mentions. Finally, in the interest of fully aut</context>

We remedy the problem using an idea from PathRank (Lao and Cohen, 2010). Instead of trying to explore all paths originating (or terminating) at e, where e may or may not belong to a target type, we focus on paths between e and other known members of the target type. 3.3 Type language model To exploit the second signal, shown in Fig. 1(b), we need to model the association between target YAGO types and the mention contexts of Wikipedia entities known to belong to those types. This model component is in the same spirit as (Zheng et al., 2012). For each target YAGO type t, we sample positive entities e F W, and for each e, we collect, from Wikipedia annotated text, a corpus of snippets mentioning e. We remove the mention words and retain the rest. We also collect salient words from the entire Wikipedia document containing the snippet, as shown in Fig. 1. At this point each target type is associated with a corpus of contexts, each represented by snippet words. We compute the IDF of all words in this corpus3, and then represent each type as a TFIDF vector (Salton and McGill, 1983). A test context is turned into a similar vector, and </context>

In 5.2, we evaluate TMI and baselines on ClueWeb12 and entities from Freebase, not limited to Wikipedia. In 5.3, we compare TMI with Googles recently published FACC1 annotations (Gabrilovich et al., 2013). 5.1 Reference corpus CW with F W entities Limited to people, |F |= 2323792, |W |= 807381, |F \\ W |= 1544942, and |F W |= 778850. It is easiest to evaluate TMI and others on Wikipedia entities. They have known YAGO types. Wikipedia text has explicit (disambiguated) entity annotations. For these reasons, the few known systems for Freebase-based annotation (Zheng et al., 2012) are evaluated exclusively on F W. 5.1.1 Seeding and setup People in F W are known by one or more mention words/phrases. From these, we collect mention phrases along with the candidate entity set for each phrase. The number of candidates is the phrases degree of ambiguity. We sort phrases by ambiguity and draw a sample over the ambiguity range. This gives us seed phrases with representative ambiguity. Then we collect all entities mentioned by these phrases. Overall we collect about 1100 entities and 5500 distinct mentions. Contrast this with (Zheng et al., 2012), who sample entities from much </context>

I.e., (Zheng et al., 2012) did not complete their entity sets with aliased entities. For all these reasons, Z0 numbers here are not directly comparable to those in their paper. 442 \x0c5.1.2 Tasks and baselines The structure of TMI suggests two natural baselines to compare against it. TMI solves two tasks simultaneously: assign types to entities and entities to snippets. So the first baseline, T0, is one that solves the typing task separately, and the second, A0, does snippet annotation separately. A third baseline, Z0, from (Zheng et al., 2012) does only snippet annotation; they do not consider typing entities. While evaluating types output by TMI and T0 against ground truth, we may wish to assign partial credit for overlapping types, e.g., athlete vs. soccer player, because our types form an incomplete hierarchy. We use the standard M&amp;W score of semantic similarity between types (Milne and Witten, 2008) for this. As regards snippet annotation, Z0 (Zheng et al., 2012) does not specify any mechanism for handling . Therefore we run two sets of experiments. In one we eliminate all snippets with ground truth .

Fig. 7 repeats the experiment while allowing . Here, in 0/1 accuracy, is regarded as just another entity. Again, we see that TMI has a clear advantage. Z0s performance here is worse than in (Zheng et al., 2012). This is explained by our much larger and difficult-to-separate type system. We disaggregate the summary results into buckets, shown in Fig. 8. Each bucket covers a range of degrees of entity nodes in Freebase, while roughly balacing the number of snippets in each bucket. TMI generally shows larger gains for low-degree buckets. 5.1.4 Type prediction results We also compared the type inference accuracy of TMI and T0; (Zheng et al., 2012) do not infer types. The summary is in Fig. 9. Two uninformed baselines are worth mentioning. Uniform random choice over 130 types gave only 2% accuracy. Choss</context>
