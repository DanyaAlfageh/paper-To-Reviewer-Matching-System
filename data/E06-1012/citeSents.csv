 CITATION employs this distance i,H(i) in the computation of word-toword dependency probabilities P(dep (wi, wH(i)) |S) (2) P(link(wi, wH(i)) |i,H(i)) suggesting that distance is a crucial variable when deciding whether two words are related, along with other features such as intervening punctuation,,
 CITATION propose a different method and introduce a new probability factor that takes into account the distance between the dependent and the head,,
 We have also been encouraged by the success of the unlexicalized parsers reported recently (CITATION; CITATION),,
 For parsing, we use a version of the Backward Beam Search Algorithm CITATION developed for Japanese dependency analysis adapted to our representations of the morphological structure of the words,,
 CITATION applied the parser of CITATION developed for English, to Czech, and found that the performance was substantially lower when compared to the results for English,,

 The third baseline parser is a deterministic rule-based parser that links each word-final IG to an IG on the right based on the approach of CITATION,,
