CITATION employs this distance i,H(i) in the computation of word-toword dependency probabilities P(dep (wi, wH(i)) |S) (2) P(link(wi, wH(i)) |i,H(i)) suggesting that distance is a crucial variable when deciding whether two words are related, along with other features such as intervening punctuation,,
CITATION propose a different method and introduce a new probability factor that takes into account the distance between the dependent and the head,,
This is a modified version of the backed-off smoothing used by CITATION to alleviate sparse data problems,,
With the emergence of the important role of word-to-word relations in parsing (CITATION; CITATION), dependency grammars have gained a certain popularity; e.g., CITATION for English, CITATION; 2002), CITATION for Japanese, CITATION for Korean, CITATION for Swedish, CITATION for Czech, among others,,
