On the other hand, as CITATION points out, the context-sensitive dependencies that &quot;unification-based&quot; constraints introduce render the relative frequency estimator suboptimal: in general it does not maximize the likelihood and it is inconsistent,,
In his seminal development of the MRF approach to spatial statistics, Besag introduced a &quot;pseudolikelihood&quot; estimator to address these difficulties (CITATION; CITATION), and in fact ,,
CITATION proposes a gradient ascent, based upon a Monte Carlo procedure for estimating E0(fj),,
 (1996) and CITATION make this same point and arrive at the same estimator, albeit through a maximum entropy argument,,
CITATION and CITATION make this same point and arrive at the same estimator, albeit through a maximum entropy argument,,
CITATION proposes a Markov Random Field or log linear model for SUBGs, and the models described here are instances of Abney\'s general framework,,
In our experiments, we have used a conjugate-gradient optimization program adapted from the one presented in CITATION,,
In his seminal development of the MRF approach to spatial statistics, Besag introduced a &quot;pseudolikelihood&quot; estimator to address these difficulties (CITATION; Besag, ,,
Pseudo-likelihood is also consistent, but in the present implementation it is consistent for the conditional distributions P0o(w[y(w)) and not necessarily for the full distribution P0o (see CITATION),,
We had the most success with a slightly modified version of the simulated annealing optimizer described in CITATION,,
In his seminal development of the MRF approach to spatial statistics, Besag introduced a &quot;pseudolikelihood&quot; estimator to address these difficulties (CITATION; CITATION), and in fact our proposal here is an instance of his method,,
In addition to production features, the stochastic LFG models evaluated below used the following kinds of features, guided by the principles proposed by CITATION,,
This set of features induces a tree-structured dependency graph on the productions which is characteristic of Markov Branching Processes (CITATION; CITATION),,
