We present several improvements to unlexicalized
parsing with hierarchically state-split PCFGs. First,
we present a novel coarse-to-fine method in which
a grammars own hierarchical projections are used
for incremental pruning, including a method for ef-
ficiently computing projections of a grammar with-
out a treebank. In our experiments, hierarchical
pruning greatly accelerates parsing with no loss in
empirical accuracy. Second, we compare various
inference procedures for state-split PCFGs from the
standpoint of risk minimization, paying particular
attention to their practical tradeoffs. Finally, we
present multilingual experiments which show that
parsing with hierarchical state-splitting is fast and
accurate in multiple languages and domains, even
without any language-specific tuning.

1 Introduction

<bodyText confidence="0.9590794">
Treebank parsing comprises two problems: learn-
ing, in which we must select a model given a tree-
bank, and inference, in which we must select a
parse for a sentence given the learned model. Pre-
vious work has shown that high-quality unlexical-
ized PCFGs can be learned from a treebank, either
by manual annotation (Klein and Manning, 2003)
or automatic state splitting (Matsuzaki et al., 2005;
Petrov et al., 2006). In particular, we demon-
strated in Petrov et al. (2006) that a hierarchically
split PCFG could exceed the accuracy of lexical-
ized PCFGs (Collins, 1999; Charniak and Johnson,
2005). However, many questions about inference
with such split PCFGs remain open. In this work,
we present

ence in split PCFGs,

<bodyText confidence="0.998953475">
In Sec. 3, we present a novel coarse-to-fine pro-
cessing scheme for hierarchically split PCFGs. Our
method considers the splitting history of the final
grammar, projecting it onto its increasingly refined
prior stages. For any projection of a grammar, we
give a new method for efficiently estimating the pro-
jections parameters from the source PCFG itself
(rather than a treebank), using techniques for infi-
nite tree distributions (Corazza and Satta, 2006) and
iterated fixpoint equations. We then parse with each
refinement, in sequence, much along the lines of
Charniak et al. (2006), except with much more com-
plex and automatically derived intermediate gram-
mars. Thresholds are automatically tuned on held-
out data, and the final system parses up to 100 times
faster than the baseline PCFG parser, with no loss in
test set accuracy.
In Sec. 4, we consider the well-known issue of
inference objectives in split PCFGs. As in many
model families (Steedman, 2000; Vijay-Shanker and
Joshi, 1985), split PCFGs have a derivation / parse
distinction. The split PCFG directly describes a gen-
erative model over derivations, but evaluation is sen-
sitive only to the coarser treebank symbols. While
the most probable parse problem is NP-complete
(Simaan, 1992), several approximate methods exist,
including n-best reranking by parse likelihood, the
labeled bracket algorithm of Goodman (1996), and
a variational approximation introduced in Matsuzaki
et al. (2005). We present experiments which explic-
itly minimize various evaluation risks over a can-
didate set using samples from the split PCFG, and
relate those conditions to the existing non-sampling
algorithms. We demonstrate that n-best reranking
according to likelihood is superior for exact match,
and that the non-reranking methods are superior for
maximizing F1. A specific contribution is to discuss
the role of unary productions, which previous work
has glossed over, but which is important in under-
standing why the various methods work as they do.

\x0cFinally, in Sec. 5, we learn state-split PCFGs for
German and Chinese and examine out-of-domain
performance for English. The learned grammars are
compact and parsing is very quick in our multi-stage
scheme. These grammars produce the highest test
set parsing figures that we are aware of in each lan-
guage, except for English for which non-local meth-
ods such as feature-based discriminative reranking
are available (Charniak and Johnson, 2005).

2 Hierarchically Split PCFGs
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.992440153846154">
We consider PCFG grammars which are derived
from a raw treebank as in Petrov et al. (2006): A
simple X-bar grammar is created by binarizing the
treebank trees. We refer to this grammar as G0.
From this starting point, we iteratively refine the
grammar in stages, as illustrated in Fig. 1. In each
stage, all symbols are split in two, for example DT
might become DT-1 and DT-2. The refined grammar
is estimated using a variant of the forward-backward
algorithm (Matsuzaki et al., 2005). After a split-
ting stage, many splits are rolled back based on (an
approximation to) their likelihood gain. This pro-
cedure gives an ontogeny of grammars Gi, where
G = Gn is the final grammar. Empirically, the
gains on the English Penn treebank level off after 6
rounds. In Petrov et al. (2006), some simple smooth-
ing is also shown to be effective. It is interesting to
note that these grammars capture many of the struc-
tural zeros described by Mohri and Roark (2006)
and pruning rules with probability below e10 re-
duces the grammar size drastically without influenc-
ing parsing performance. Some of our methods and
conclusions are relevant to all state-split grammars,
such as Klein and Manning (2003) or Dreyer and
Eisner (2006), while others apply most directly to
the hierarchical case.

<bodyText confidence="0.99969075">
When working with large grammars, it is standard to
prune the search space in some way. In the case of
lexicalized grammars, the unpruned chart often will
not even fit in memory for long sentences. Several
proven techniques exist. Collins (1999) combines a
punctuation rule which eliminates many spans en-
tirely, and then uses span-synchronous beams to
prune in a bottom-up fashion. Charniak et al. (1998)

introduces best-first parsing, in which a figure-of-
merit prioritizes agenda processing. Most relevant
to our work is Charniak and Johnson (2005) which
uses a pre-parse phase to rapidly parse with a very
coarse, unlexicalized treebank grammar. Any item
X:[i, j] with sufficiently low posterior probability in
the pre-parse triggers the pruning of its lexical vari-
ants in a subsequent full parse.

3.1 Coarse-to-Fine Approaches
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999722">
Charniak et al. (2006) introduces multi-level coarse-
to-fine parsing, which extends the basic pre-parsing
idea by adding more rounds of pruning. In their
work, the extra pruning was with grammars even
coarser than the raw treebank grammar, such as
a grammar in which all nonterminals are col-
lapsed. We propose a novel multi-stage coarse-to-
fine method which is particularly natural for our hi-
erarchically split grammar, but which is, in princi-
ple, applicable to any grammar. As in Charniak et
al. (2006), we construct a sequence of increasingly
refined grammars, reparsing with each refinement.
The contributions of our method are that we derive
sequences of refinements in a new way (Sec. 3.2),
we consider refinements which are themselves com-
plex, and, because our full grammar is not impossi-
ble to parse with, we automatically tune the pruning
thresholds on held-out data.

3.2 Projection
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.998214">
In our method, which we call hierarchical coarse-
to-fine parsing, we consider a sequence of PCFGs
G0, G1, . . . Gn = G, where each Gi is a refinement
of the preceding grammar Gi1 and G is the full
grammar of interest. Each grammar Gi is related to

\x0cprojection is a map from the non-terminal (including
pre-terminal) symbols of G onto a reduced domain.
A projection of grammar symbols induces a pro-
jection of rules and therefore entire non-weighted
grammars (see Fig. 1).
In our case, we also require the projections to be
sequentially compatible, so that ij =kjik.
That is, each projection is itself a coarsening of the
previous projections. In particular, we take the pro-
jection ij to be the map that collapses split sym-
bols in round i to their earlier identities in round j.
It is straightforward to take a projection and
map a CFG G to its induced projection (G). What
is less obvious is how the probabilities associated
with the rules of G should be mapped. In the case
where (G) is more coarse than the treebank orig-
inally used to train G, and when that treebank is
available, it is easy to project the treebank and di-
rectly estimate, say, the maximum-likelihood pa-
rameters for (G). This is the approach taken by
Charniak et al. (2006), where they estimate what in
our terms are projections of the raw treebank gram-
mar from the treebank itself.
However, treebank estimation has several limita-
tions. First, the treebank used to train G may not
be available. Second, if the grammar G is heavily
smoothed or otherwise regularized, its own distri-
bution over trees may be far from that of the tree-
bank. Third, the meanings of the split states can and
do drift between splitting stages. Fourth, and most
importantly, we may wish to project grammars for
which treebank estimation is problematic, for exam-
ple, grammars which are more refined than the ob-
served treebank grammars. Our method effectively
avoids all of these problems by rebuilding and refit-
ting the pruning grammars on the fly from the final
grammar.

3.2.1 Estimating Projected Grammars
</subsubsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999307629629629">
Fortunately, there is a well worked-out notion of
estimating a grammar from an infinite distribution
over trees (Corazza and Satta, 2006). In particular,
we can estimate parameters for a projected grammar
(G) from the tree distribution induced by G (which
can itself be estimated in any manner). The earli-
est work that we are aware of on estimating models
from models in this way is that of Nederhof (2005),
who considers the case of learning language mod-
els from other language models. Corazza and Satta
(2006) extend these methods to the case of PCFGs
and tree distributions.
The generalization of maximum likelihood esti-
mation is to find the estimates for (G) with min-
imum KL divergence from the tree distribution in-
duced by G. Since (G) is a grammar over coarser
symbols, we fit (G) to the distribution G induces
over -projected trees: P((T)|G). The proofs
of the general case are given in Corazza and Satta
(2006), but the resulting procedure is quite intuitive.
Given a (fully observed) treebank, the maximum-
likelihood estimate for the probability of a rule X
Y Z would simply be the ratio of the count of X to
the count of the configuration X Y Z. If we wish
to find the estimate which has minimum divergence
to an infinite distribution P(T), we use the same for-
mula, but the counts become expected counts:
</bodyText>

P(X Y Z) =
EP (T)[X Y Z]

</equation>
<bodyText confidence="0.9982522">
with unaries estimated similarly. In our specific
case, X, Y, and Z are symbols in (G), and the
expectations are taken over Gs distribution of -
projected trees, P((T)|G). We give two practical
methods for obtaining these expectations below.
</bodyText>
<subsubsectionHeader confidence="0.980769">
3.2.2 Calculating Projected Expectations
</subsubsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.997056125">
Concretely, we can now estimate the minimum
divergence parameters of (G) for any projection
and PCFG G if we can calculate the expecta-
tions of the projected symbols and rules according to
P((T)|G). The simplest option is to sample trees
T from G, project the samples, and take average
counts off of these samples. In the limit, the counts
will converge to the desired expectations, provided
the grammar is proper. However, we can exploit the
structure of our projections to obtain the desired ex-
pectations much more simply and efficiently.
First, consider the problem of calculating the ex-
pected counts of a symbol X in a tree distribution
given by a grammar G, ignoring the issue of projec-
tion. These expected counts obey the following one-
step equations (assuming a unique root symbol):

\x0cHere, , , or both can be empty, and a rule X
appears in the sum once for each X it contains. In
principle, this linear system can be solved in any
way.1 In our experiments, we solve this system it-
eratively, with the following recurrences:

<equation confidence="0.9983395">

<bodyText confidence="0.999759583333333">
Note that, as in other iterative fixpoint methods, such
as policy evaluation for Markov decision processes
(Sutton and Barto, 1998), the quantities ck(X) have
a useful interpretation as the expected counts ignor-
ing nodes deeper than depth k (i.e. the roots are all
the root symbol, so c0(root) = 1). In our experi-
ments this method converged within around 25 iter-
ations; this is unsurprising, since the treebank con-
tains few nodes deeper than 25 and our base gram-
mar G seems to have captured this property.
Once we have the expected counts of symbols
in G, the expected counts of their projections

X:(X)=X c(X). Rules can be esti-
mated directly using similar recurrences, or given by
one-step equations:
c(X ) = c(X)P(|X)
This process very rapidly computes the estimates
for a projection of a grammar (i.e. in a few seconds
for our largest grammars), and is done once during
initialization of the parser.

3.2.3 Hierarchical Projections
</subsubsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999317888888889">
Recall that our final state-split grammars G come,
by their construction process, with an ontogeny of
grammars Gi where each grammar is a (partial)
splitting of the preceding one. This gives us a nat-
ural chain of projections ij which projects back-
wards along this ontogeny of grammars (see Fig. 1).
Of course, training also gives us parameters for
the grammars, but only the chain of projections is
needed. Note that the projected estimates need not

parameters of the grammar. In particular, G may be improper,

(and in general will not) recover the original param-
eters exactly, nor would we want them to. Instead
they take into account any smoothing, substate drift,
and so on which occurred by the final grammar.
Starting from the base grammar, we run the pro-
jection process for each stage in the sequence, cal-
culating i (chained incremental projections would
also be possible). For the remainder of the paper,
except where noted otherwise, all coarser grammars
estimates are these reconstructions, rather than those
originally learned.

<bodyText confidence="0.9995302">
As demonstrated by Charniak et al. (2006) parsing
times can be greatly reduced by pruning chart items
that have low posterior probability under a simpler
grammar. Charniak et al. (2006) pre-parse with a se-
quence of grammars which are coarser than (parent-
annotated) treebank grammars. However, we also
work with grammars which are already heavily split,
up to half as split as the final grammar, because we
found the computational cost for parsing with the
simple X-bar grammar to be insignificant compared
to the costs for parsing with more refined grammars.
For a final grammar G = Gn, we compute esti-
mates for the n projections Gn1, . . . , G0 =X-Bar,
where Gi = i(G) as described in the previous sec-
tion. Additionally we project to a grammar G1 in
which all nonterminals, except for the preterminals,
have been collapsed. During parsing, we start of
by exhaustively computing the inside/outside scores
with G1. At each stage, chart items with low poste-
rior probability are removed from the chart, and we
proceed to compute inside/outside scores with the
next, more refined grammar, using the projections
ii1 to map between symbols in Gi and Gi1. In
each pass, we skip chart items whose projection into
the previous stage had a probability below a stage-
specific threshold, until we reach G = Gn (after
seven passes in our case). For G, we do not prune
but instead return the minimum risk tree, as will be
described in Sec. 4.
Fig. 2 shows the (unlabeled) bracket posteriors af-
ter each pass and demonstrates that most construc-
tions can be ruled out by the simpler grammars,
greatly reducing the amount of computation for the
following passes. The pruning thresholds were em-
pirically determined on a held out set by computing

This setting also caused no search errors on the test
set. We found our projected grammar estimates to be
at least equally well suited for pruning as the orig-
inal grammar estimates which were learned during
the hierarchical training. Tab. 1 shows the tremen-
dous reduction in parsing time (all times are cumu-
lative) and gives an overview over grammar sizes
and parsing accuracies. In particular, in our Java im-
plementation on a 3GHz processor, it is possible to
parse the 1578 development set sentences (of length
40 or less) in less than 1200 seconds with an F1 of
91.2% (no search errors), or, by pruning more, in
680 seconds at 91.1%. For comparison, the Feb.
2006 release of the Charniak and Johnson (2005)
parser runs in 1150 seconds on the same machine
with an F1 of 90.7%.

form. Exact match (likelihood) has this property. In
general, however, we can approximate the expecta-
tion with samples from P(T|w, G). The method for
sampling derivations of a PCFG is given in Finkel
et al. (2006) and Johnson et al. (2007). It requires a
single inside-outside computation per sentence and
is then efficient per sample. Note that for split gram-
mars, a posterior parse sample can be drawn by sam-
pling a derivation and projecting away the substates.
Fig. 2 shows the results of the following exper-
iment. We constructed 10-best lists from the full
grammar G in Sec. 2 using the parser of Petrov et
al. (2006). We then took the same grammar and ex-
tracted 500-sample lists using the method of Finkel
et al. (2006). The minimum risk parse candidate was
selected for various loss functions. As can be seen,
in most cases, risk minimization reduces test-set loss
of the relevant quantity. Exact match is problematic,
however, because 500 samples is often too few to
draw a match when a sentence has a very flat poste-
rior, and so there are many all-way ties.2 Since ex-
act match permits a non-sampled calculation of the
expected risk, we show this option as well, which
is substantially superior. This experiment highlights
that the correct procedure for exact match is to find
the most probable parse.
An alternative approach to reranking candidate
parses is to work with inference criteria which ad-
mit dynamic programming solutions. Fig. 3 shows
three possible objective functions which use the eas-
ily obtained posterior marginals of the parse tree dis-
tribution. Interestingly, while they have fairly differ-
ent decision theoretic motivations, their closed-form
solutions are similar.

5,000 samples do not improve the numbers appreciably.
One option is to maximize likelihood in an ap-
proximate distribution. Matsuzaki et al. (2005)
present a VARIATIONAL approach, which approxi-
mates the true posterior over parses by a cruder, but
tractable sentence-specific one. In this approximate
distribution there is no derivation / parse distinction
and one can therefore optimize exact match by se-
lecting the most likely derivation.
Instead of approximating the tree distribution we
can use an objective function that decomposes along
parse posteriors. The labeled brackets algorithm of
Goodman (1996) has such an objective function. In
its original formulation this algorithm maximizes
the number of expected correct nodes, but instead
we can use it to maximize the number of correct
rules (the MAX-RULE-SUM algorithm). A worry-
ing issue with this method is that it is ill-defined for
grammars which allow infinite unary chains: there
will be no finite minimum risk tree under recall loss
(you can always reduce the risk by adding one more
cycle). We implement MAX-RULE-SUM in a CNF-
like grammar family where above each binary split
is exactly one unary (possibly a self-loop). With
this limitation, unary chains are not a problem. As
might be expected, this criterion improves bracket
measures at the expense of exact match.
We found it optimal to use a third approach,
in which rule posteriors are multiplied instead of
added. This corresponds to choosing the tree with
greatest chance of having all rules correct, under
the (incorrect) assumption that the rules correct-
ness are independent. This MAX-RULE-PRODUCT
algorithm does not need special treatment of infi-
nite unary chains because it is optimizing a product
rather than a sum. While these three methods yield

5 Multilingual Parsing
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999694888888889">
Most research on parsing has focused on English
and parsing performance on other languages is gen-
erally significantly lower.3 Recently, there have
been some attempts to adapt parsers developed for
English to other languages (Levy and Manning,
2003; Cowan and Collins, 2005). Adapting lexi-
calized parsers to other languages in not a trivial
task as it requires at least the specification of head
rules, and has had limited success. Adapting unlexi-
calized parsers appears to be equally difficult: Levy
and Manning (2003) adapt the unlexicalized parser
of Klein and Manning (2003) to Chinese, but even
after significant efforts on choosing category splits,
only modest performance gains are reported.
In contrast, automatically learned grammars like
the one of Matsuzaki et al. (2005) and Petrov et al.
(2006) require a treebank for training but no addi-
tional human input. One has therefore reason to

5.1 Experiments

<bodyText confidence="0.999586476190476">
We trained models for English, Chinese and Ger-
man using the standard corpora and splits as shown
in Tab. 3. We applied our model directly to each
of the treebanks, without any language dependent
modifications. Specifically, the same model hyper-
parameters (merging percentage and smoothing fac-
tor) were used in all experiments.
Tab. 4 shows that automatically inducing latent
structure is a technique that generalizes well across
language boundaries and results in state of the art
performance for Chinese and German. On English,
the parser is outperformed only by the reranking
parser of Charniak and Johnson (2005), which has
access to a variety of features which cannot be cap-
tured by a generative model.
Space does not permit a thorough exposition of
our analysis, but as in the case of English (Petrov
et al., 2006), the learned subcategories exhibit inter-
esting linguistic interpretations. In German, for ex-
ample, the model learns subcategories for different
cases and genders.

Related to cross language generalization is the gen-
eralization across domains for the same language.
It is well known that a model trained on the Wall
Street Journal loses significantly in performance
when evaluated on the Brown Corpus (see Gildea
(2001) for more details and the exact setup of their
experiment, which we duplicated here). Recently
McClosky et al. (2006) came to the conclusion that
this performance drop is not due to overfitting the
WSJ data. Fig. 4 shows the performance on the
Brown corpus during hierarchical training. While
the F1 score on the WSJ is rising we observe a drop
in performance after the 5th iteration, suggesting
that some overfitting is occurring.

First, we present a novel coarse-to-fine method in which a grammars own hierarchical projections are used for incremental pruning, including a method for efficiently computing projections of a grammar without a treebank. In our experiments, hierarchical pruning greatly accelerates parsing with no loss in empirical accuracy. Second, we compare various inference procedures for state-split PCFGs from the standpoint of risk minimization, paying particular attention to their practical tradeoffs. Finally, we present multilingual experiments which show that parsing with hierarchical state-splitting is fast and accurate in multiple languages and domains, even without any language-specific tuning.</abstract>
