We now briefly describe the translation model for the probability P(FIE); a more thorough account is provided in CITATION,,
In speech recognition, CITATION have introduced a technique for,,
(1989) have used decision tree models and Della CITATION have used automatically inferred link grammars to model long range correlations in language,,
It also includes the part-of-speech tags for these words, and the classes of these words as derived from a mutual-information clustering scheme described in CITATION,,
An optimization method specifically tailored to the maximum entropy problem is the iterative scaling algorithm of CITATION,,
In parsing, CITATION have described how to extract grammatical * Thisresearch,supportedin part by ARPAundergrantONRN00014-91-C-0135, was conductedwhile the authorswereat the IBMT.J,,
In speech recognition, CITATION have introduced a technique for automatically discovering relevant features for the translation of word spelling to word pronunciation,,
CITATION describe a method of estimating these parameters to maximize the likelihood of a large bilingual corpus of English and French sentences,,
Jaynes, a more recent pioneer of maximum entropy, put it CITATION: ..,,
Laplace might justly be considered the father of maximum entropy, having enunciated the underlying theme 200 years ago in his &quot;Principle of Insufficient Reason:&quot; when one has no information to distinguish between the probability of two events, the best strategy is to consider them equally likely CITATION,,
We present here a version of this algorithm specifically designed for the problem at hand; a proof of the monotonicity and convergence of the algorithm is given in Della CITATION,,
When applied to the maximum entropy problem, this technique yields the popular Brown algorithm CITATION,,
The relevant steps are outlined here; the reader is referred to Della CITATION for a more thorough discussion of constrained optimization as applied to maximum entropy,,
Adopting the least complex hypothesis possible is embodied in Occam\'s razor (&quot;Nunquam ponenda est pluralitas sine necesitate.\') and even appears earlier, in the Bible and the writings of Herotodus CITATION,,
