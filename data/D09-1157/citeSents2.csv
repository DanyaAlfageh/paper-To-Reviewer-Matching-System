We used the Stanford parser CITATION, and also a variant of the Stanford parser (i.e., Stanford-Genia), which was trained on the GENIA treebank CITATION for biomedical text; Deep parsers aim to compute in-depth syntactic and semantic structures based on syntactic theories such as HPSG CITATION and CCG CITATION,,
We used the C&C parser CITATION, ENJU CITATION, and a variant of ENJU CITATION adapted for the biomedical domain (i.e., ENJU-Genia); There were a number of practical issues to consider when using parsers for this task,,
We used Minipar CITATION and RASP CITATION for the experiments; Constituent-structured parsers split a sentence into syntactic constituents such as noun phrases or verb phrases,,
