5 Evaluation 5.1 Data and Ontology The species disambiguation experiments were conducted using the ITI-TXM corpus (CITATIONb), a collection of full-length biomedical research articles manually annotated with linguistic and biomedical information for developing automatic information extraction systems,,
OS tags and punctuation labels that were derived from the CLAWS-7 tagset,10 whereas our dataset uses POS labels from the Penn Treebank tagset CITATION,,
CITATION showed that species disambiguation is one of the most important steps for term normalisation and identification, which concerns automatically associating mentions of biomedical entities in text to unique database identifiers CITATION,,
CITATION) and RASP CITATION for the experiments; Constituent-structured parsers split a sentence into syntactic constituents such as noun phrases or verb phrases,,
CITATION used syntactic paths as one of the features to train a support vector machines (SVM) model for PPIs and also discussed how different parsers and output representations affected the end results,,
To avoid the noise that can be introduced in the pre-processing steps and to concentrate on evaluating the performance of the parsers, we used the same pre-processing tools (CITATIONa)9 whenever possible,,
We compared two feature selection methods that reportedly work well on the task of text classification: information gain (IG) CITATION 6 http://homepages.inf.ed.ac.uk/ s0450736/maxent_toolkit.html 7 http://svmlight.joachims.org/ The ARG1 ARG1 ARG2 ARG1 ARG2 ARG1 D r o s o p h i l a K i p 3 is o r t h o l o g u e o f K l p 6 7 A ,,
useful to infer biological relations (e.g., CITATION; CITATION),,
We used the Stanford parser CITATION, and also a variant of the Stanford parser (i.e., Stanford-Genia), which was trained on the GENIA treebank CITATION for biomedical text; Deep parsers aim to compute in-depth syntactic and semantic structures based on syntactic theories such as HPSG CITATION and CCG CITATION,,
 from the Penn Treebank tagset CITATION,,
istributions of the semantic classes are different in the training and test datasets (CITATION; CITATION),,
CITATION comparably evaluated a number of kernels for incorporating syntactic features, including the bag-of-word kernel, the subset tree kernel CITATION and the graph kernel CITATION, and they concluded that combining all kernels achieved better results than using any individual one,,
Also, the task of extracting PPIs in the recent BioCreative Challenge II workshop CITATION requires protein pairs to be recognised and normalised, which inevitably involves species disambiguation,,
We used the C&C parser CITATION, ENJU CITATION, and a variant of ,,
y growing biomedical literature CITATION,,
Both tasks are particularly important for biomedical text mining, which concerns automatically extracting facts from the exponentially growing biomedical literature CITATION,,
5.2.3 Statistical Significance To see whether our methods significantly improved the baseline systems, we performed randomisation tests (CITATION; CITATION) on some of the results shown in Table 3,,
Such problems are also major concerns when developing a system to disambiguate biomedical named entities (e.g., protein, 1513 \x0cgene, and disease), for which some researchers rely on hand-crafted rules in addition to a small amount of training data (CITATION; CITATION),,
We used the Stanford parser CITATION, and also a variant of the Stanford parser (i.e., Stanford,,

CITATION used syntactic paths as one of the features to train a support vector machines (SVM) model for PPIs and also d,,
The preprocessing steps include sentence boundary detection, tokenisation and part-of-speech (POS) tagging, all of which can be tricky especially when applied to biomedical text CITATION,,
We used the C&C parser CITATION, ENJU CITATION, and a variant of ENJU CITATION adapted for the biomedical domain (i.e., ENJU-Genia); There were a number of practical issues to consider when using parsers for this task,,
We used Minipar CITATION and RASP CITATION for the experiments; Constituent-structured parsers split a sentence into syntactic constituents such as noun phrases or verb phrases,,

For example, to determine whether an occurrence of an entity is a protein, a gene or an RNA, CITATION compared performance of 3 supervised classification methods and reported results near the human agreement rate,,
We used the C&C parser CITATION, ENJU (Miyao and ,,
In total, 4 representations were used: grammatical relation (GR) CITATION, Stanford typed dependency (SD) (de Marneffe et al., 2006), Minipars own representation CITATION, and ENJUs predicate-argument structure (,,
ee the results grouped into the following categories: a type of snake, a programming language, or a film CITATION,,
In total, 4 representations were used: grammatical relation (GR) CITATION, Stanford typed dependency (SD) (de Marneffe et al., 2006), Minipars own representation CITATION, and ENJUs predicate-argument structure (PAS),,
We encoded this knowledge in a rule-based species tagging system CITATION,,
r an RNA, CITATION compared performance of 3 supervised classification methods and reported results near the human agreement rate,,
For example, CITATION used the shortest path between two g,,
In other words, when |D |is large, named entity disambiguation becomes a multi-class classification task on heterogeneous and imbalanced datasets, which is challenging for a machine learning model to learn to discriminate enough between the semantic classes CITATION,,
For example, CITATION used the shortest path between two genes according to edit distance in a dependency tree to define a kernel function for extracting gene interactions,,
We followed the PPI extraction method described in CITATION, where two types of features were used for a SVM classifier,,
RASP requires POS tags and punctuation labels that were derived from the CLAWS-7 tagset,10 whereas our dataset uses POS labels from the Penn Treebank tagset CITATION,,
For bagof-word features, a linear kernel was used, and for syntactic ones, a subset tree kernel CITATION was adopted,,
For instance, given a search term Python, users may like to see the results grouped into the following categories: a type of snake, a programming language, or a film CITATION,,
 classes are different in the training and test datasets (CITATION; CITATION),,
CITATION collected gene names from various source databases and calculated intra- and inter-species ambiguities,,

In addition, supervised techniques may not yield reliable results when the distributions of the semantic classes are different in the training and test datasets (CITATION; CITATION),,
In practice, an automated named entity recogniser (e.g., ABNER CITATION) should be used before applying the systems,,
