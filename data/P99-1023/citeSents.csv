2.1 Basic Definitions and Notation According to CITATION, there are five elements needed to define an HMM: 1,,
First, the variables ~ and from CITATION are redefined, as shown in Figure 1,,
Most work in the area of unknown words and tagging deals with predicting part-of-speech information based on word endings and affixation information, as shown by work in CITATION, CITATION, CITATION, and CITATION,,

A better smoothing approach for lexical information could possibly be created by using some sort of word class idea, such as the genotype idea used in CITATION, to improve our /5 estimate,,
