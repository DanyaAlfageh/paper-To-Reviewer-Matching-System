Much research has been done to improve tagging accuracy using several different models and methods, including: hidden Markov models (HMMs) CITATION, CITATION; rule-based systems CITATION, CITATION; memory-based systems CITATION; maximum-entropy systems CITATION; path voting constraint systems CITATION; linear separator systems CITATION; and majority voting systems (van Halteren et al., 1998),,
The Penn Treebank documentation CITATION defines a commonly used set of tags,,
998), and the voting constraint tagger CITATION used training data that contained full lexical information (i.e., no unknown words), as well as training and testing data that did not cover the entire WSJ corpus,,
The standard trigram tagger data is from CITATION,,
