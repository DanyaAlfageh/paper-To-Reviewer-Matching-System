3.2 Language Models In all the experiments, we use SRILM CITATION to train 4-gram language models (with the default backoff model) from various corpora,,
We use the reference sets (Section 3.4) as follows: 1,000 sentences are randomly extracted for minimum error-rate tuning CITATION, and another set of 1,000 sentences is randomly used for evaluation,,
The combined effect of these laws creates a hybrid text that partly corresponds to the source text and partly to texts written originally in the target language but in fact belongs to neither CITATION,,
van Halteren (2008) focuses on six languages from Europarl CITATION: Dutch, English, French, German, Italian and Spanish,,
We also construct a Hebrew-to-English MT system using Moses factored translation model CITATION,,
Some numeric data are listed in CITATION,,
CITATION use machine learning techniques to distinguish between original and translated Italian texts, reporting 86.7% accuracy,,
CITATION, 1995) distinguishes between two laws: the law of interference and the law of growing standardization,,
1 Introduction Statistical machine translation (MT) uses large target language models (LMs) to improve the fluency of generated texts, and it is commonly assumed that for constructing language models, more data is better data CITATION,,
Then, we compare the translation quality of these systems in terms of the BLEU metric CITATION,,
 texts, and it is commonly assumed that for constructing language models, more data is better data CITATION,,
We test the statistical significance of differences between various MT systems using the bootstrap resampling method CITATION,,
wN is the probability of W normalized by the number of words N CITATION, page 96): PP(L, W) = N v u u t N Y i=1 1 PL(wi|w1 ,,
CITATION show that the direction of translation affects the performance of statistical MT,,
T-based LMs to the reference set (HE-EN), different abstraction levels English MT systems using the Moses phrasebased SMT toolkit CITATION,,
Next, we replace all nouns with their POS tag; we use the Stanford POS Tagger CITATION,,
Only later studies consider grammatical differences (see, e.g., Santos CITATION),,
te tuning CITATION, and another set of 1,000 sentences is randomly used for evaluation,,
CITATION, 1995, 1996) suggests several candidates for translation universals, which are claimed to appear in any translated text, regardless of the source language,,
Recently, corpus-based computational analysis corroborated this observation, and CITATION apply it to statistical machine translation, showing that for an English-to-French MT system, a translation model trained on an English-translated-toFrench parallel corpus is better than one trained on French-translated-to-English texts,,
Then, we use the Stanford Named Entity Recognizer CITATION to identify named entities, which we replace with a unique token (NE),,
Our main corpus is Europarl CITATION, specifically portions collected over years 1996 to 365 \x0c1999 and 2001 to 2009,,
Interestingly, the O-corpus LM has more unique unigrams than the T-corpus LM, supporting the claim of CITATION that translated texts have lower type-to-token ratio,,
We use BLEU CITATION to evaluate translation quality,,
Recently, corpus-based computational analysis corroborated this observation, and CITATION apply it to statistical machine translation, showing that for an English-to-French MT system, a t,,
For Hebrew we use the Hebrew English parallel corpus CITATION which contains sentences translated from Hebrew to English (54%) and from English to Hebrew (46%),,
