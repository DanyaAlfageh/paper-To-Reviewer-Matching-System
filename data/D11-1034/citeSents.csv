 Interestingly, the O-corpus LM has more unique unigrams than the T-corpus LM, supporting the claim of CITATION that translated texts have lower type-to-token ratio,,
 The combined effect of these laws creates a hybrid text that partly corresponds to the source text and partly to texts written originally in the target language but in fact belongs to neither CITATION,,

 1 Introduction Statistical machine translation (MT) uses large target language models (LMs) to improve the fluency of generated texts, and it is commonly assumed that for constructing language models, more data is better data CITATION,,
 Recently, corpus-based computational analysis corroborated this observation, and CITATION apply it to statistical machine translation, showing that for an English-to-French MT system, a t,,
 Then, we use the Stanford Named Entity Recognizer CITATION to identify named entities, which we replace with a unique token (NE),,
 Next, we replace all nouns with their POS tag; we use the Stanford POS Tagger CITATION,,

 Then, we compare the translation quality of these systems in terms of the BLEU metric CITATION,,
2 Language Models In all the experiments, we use SRILM CITATION to train 4-gram language models (with the default backoff model) from various corpora,,
 Our main corpus is Europarl CITATION, specifically portions collected over years 1996 to 365 \x0c1999 and 2001 to 2009,,
 We also construct a Hebrew-to-English MT system using Moses factored translation model CITATION,,

 Recently, corpus-based computational analysis corroborated this observation, and CITATION apply it to statistical machine translation, showing that for an English-to-French MT system, a translation model trained on an English-translated-toFrench parallel corpus is better than one trained on French-translated-to-English texts,,

 For Hebrew we use the Hebrew English parallel corpus CITATION which contains sentences translated from Hebrew to English (54%) and from English to Hebrew (46%),,
