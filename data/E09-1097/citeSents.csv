This is similar to work in semantic role labelling by CITATION,,
In CITATION, we showed that introducing a model of argument positions into a greedy spanning tree algorithm had little effect on performance,,
We first adapt the Chu-Liu-Edmonds (CLE) algorithm (see CITATION and CITATION), used in CITATION, to include a basic argument model, added to keep track of linear precedence between heads and modifiers,,
Additionally, a 4-gram language model was obtained from a subsection of the BLLIP99 Corpus (LDC number: LDC2000T43) containing three years of WSJ data from 1987 to 1989 CITATION,,
In CITATION, we showed that introducing a model of argument positions into a greedy spanning tree algorithm ha,,
The alignment of answers to question types as a semantic role labelling task using similar methods was explored by CITATION,,
Our work is also strongly related to that of CITATION which constructs symbolic semantic structures via an assignment process in order to provide surface realisers with input,,
The algorithm operates recursively if called on an 1 Adapted from CITATION and http://www.ce.rit.edu/ sjyeec/dmst.html ,,
Success is indicated by the proportion of the original sentence regenerated, as measured by any string comparison method: in our case, using the BLEU metric CITATION,,
The standard polynomial-time solution to the assignment problem is the Kuhn-Munkres (or Hungarian) algorithm CITATION.2 4.2 A Dependency-Spanning Tree Algorithm Our alternative dependency-spanning tree algorithm, presented as Algorithm 3, incrementally adds vertices to a growing spanning tree,,
Adopting an approach similar to CITATION, we look at the direction (left or right) of the head with respect to the modifier; we consequently define a set D = {l, r} to represent this,,
The WIDL formalism CITATION was proposed to efficiently encode constraints that restricted possible word sequences, for example dependency information,,
That is, we do not regenerate the base noun phrases.4 3 Alternative grammaticality measures have been developed recently CITATION,,
6 Related Work 6.1 Statistical Surface Realisers The work in this paper is similar to research in statistical surface realisation (for example, CITATION; CITATION; CITATION),,
To calculate the edge weights, we adapt the definition of CITATION to use direction rather than relation t,,
In this paper, we describe a new algorithm that improves upon the grammaticality of statistically generated sentences, evaluated on a string regeneration task, which was first proposed as a surrogate for a grammaticality test by CITATION,,
To calculate the edge weights, we adapt the definition of CITATION to use direction rather than relation type (represented in the original as triples of non-terminals),,
6.3 Parsing and Semantic Role Labelling This paper presents work closely related to parsing work by CITATION which searches for the best parse tree,,
As in CITATION, the 1987 portion of the BLLIP corpus containing 20 million words was also used to create a language model, referred to here as BLLIP-LM,,
As an evaluation task, string regeneration reflects the issues that challenge the sentence generation components of machine translation, paraphrase generation, and summarisation systems CITATION,,
Approaches for other language types, for example German, have been explored CITATION,,
6.2 Text-to-Text Generation As a text-to-text approach, our work is more similar to work on Information Fusion CITATION, a sub-problem in multi-document summarisation,,
Significance was measured using the sign test and the sampling method outlined in CITATION,,
2 A Graph Representation of Dependencies In couching statistical generation as a spanning tree problem, this work is the generation analog of the parsing work by CITATION,,
We extend the original formulation of CITATION by adding a notion of argument positions for a word, providing points to attach modifiers,,
We have also folded the function contract in CITATION into the main algorithm,,
Mirroring the use of spanning tree algorithms in parsing CITATION, we present an approach to statistical sentence generation,,
Work on phrasebased statistical machine translation has been applied to paraphrase generation CITATION and multi-sentence alignment in summarisation (Daume III and Marcu, 2004),,
 Generation As a text-to-text approach, our work is more similar to work on Information Fusion CITATION, a sub-problem in multi-document summarisation,,
This makes the search for an optimal tree an NP-hard problem CITATION as all possible trees must be considered to find an optimal solution,,
Informally, as all dependency relations between each pair of words are possible, the set of all possible dependencies can be represented as a graph, as noted by CITATION,,
