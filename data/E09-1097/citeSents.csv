In this paper, we describe a new algorithm that improves upon the grammaticality of statistically generated sentences, evaluated on a string regeneration task, which was first proposed as a surrogate for a grammaticality test by CITATION,,

We first adapt the Chu-Liu-Edmonds (CLE) algorithm (see CITATION and CITATION), used in CITATION, to include a basic argument model, added to keep track of linear precedence between heads and modifiers,,

Significance was measured using the sign test and the sampling method outlined in CITATION,,
Adopting an approach similar to CITATION, we look at the direction (left or right) of the head with respect to the modifier; we consequently define a set D = {l, r} to represent this,,
To calculate the edge weights, we adapt the definition of CITATION to use direction rather than relation type (represented in the original as triples of non-terminals),,

2 A Graph Representation of Dependencies In couching statistical generation as a spanning tree problem, this work is the generation analog of the parsing work by CITATION,,
Informally, as all dependency relations between each pair of words are possible, the set of all possible dependencies can be represented as a graph, as noted by CITATION,,
We extend the original formulation of CITATION by adding a notion of argument positions for a word, providing points to attach modifiers,,
