average it with LIN, the widely used symmetric measure of distributional similarity proposed by CITATION: LIN(u, v) = P fFuFv [wu(f) + wv(f)] P fFu wu(f) + P fFv wv(f) LIN essentially measures feature vector overlap,,
In the second step, following standard practice, the co-occurrence counts are converted into pointwise mutual information (PMI) scores CITATION,,
An SVM with a polynomial kernel takes into account not only individual input features but also their interactions (CITATION, chapter 15),,
Second, our QN study demonstrates that phrasal entailment can be automatically detected and thus paves the way to apply DS to advanced NLP tasks such as recognizing textual entailment CITATION,,
Most RTE systems are based on advanced NLP components, machine learning techniques, and/or syntactic transformations (CITATION; CITATION),,
In particular, CITATION carefully crafted the balAPinc measure (see Section 3.5 below),,
3.5 Classification methods We consider two methods to classify candidate pairs as entailing or non-entailing, the balAPinc measure of CITATION and a standard Support Vector Machine (SVM) classifier,,
The other strand attempts to reformulate FSs notion of logical inference in terms that DS can capture (CITATION; CITATION; CITATION; CITATION),,

2 Background 2.1 Distributional semantics above the word level DS models such as LSA CITATION and HAL CITATION approximate the meaning of a word by a vector that summarizes its distribution in a corpus, for example by counting co-occurrences of the word with other words,,
A few systems exploit deep FS analysis (CITATION; CITATION),,
Recently, there has been a flurry of interest in DS to model meaning composition: How can we derive the DS representation of a composite phrase from that of its constituents? Although the general focus in the area is to perform algebraic operations on word semantic vectors CITATION, some researchers have also directly examined the corpus contexts of phrases,,
CITATION and CITATION look at corpus-harvested phrase vectors to learn composition functions that should derive such composite vectors automatically,,
Our SVM classifiers are trained and tested using Weka 3 and LIBSVM 2.8 CITATION,,
For example, CITATION studied vector extraction for phrases because they were interested in the decomposability of multiword expressions,,
Entailment systems have been compared under this new perspective in various evaluation campaigns, the best known being the Recognizing Textual Entailment (RTE) initiative CITATION,,
Since semantically similar words tend to share similar contexts, DS has been very successful in tasks that require quantifying semantic similarity among words, such as synonym detection and concept clustering CITATION,,
CITATION and CITATION look at corpus-harv,,
One strand attempts to model compositionality with DS methods, representing both primitive and composed linguistic expressions as distributional vectors (CITATION; CITATION; CITATION; CITATION),,
 synonym detection and concept clustering CITATION,,
FS has successfully modeled quantification and captured inferential relations between phrases and between sentences (CITATION; Thomason, 1974; CITATION),,
Lexical entailment is in turn fundamental for constructing ontologies and other lexical resources CITATION,,
Entailment in DS CITATION suggests that it may not be possible to induce lexical entailment directly from a vector space representation, but it is possible to encode the relation in this space after it has been derived through other means,,
SVM Support vector machines are widely used high-performance discriminative classifiers that find the hyperplane providing the best separation between negative and positive instances CITATION,,
The most popular approach, first adopted by CITATION, extracts lexical relations from patterns in large corpora,,
Several studies have refined and extended this approach (CITATION; CITATION; CITATION; CITATION),,
Both methods that generalize entailment from AN |= N to N1 |= N2 perform well, with 70% mais, 1997; CITATION; CITATION), we tried balAPinc on the SVD-reduced vectors as well, but results were consistently worse than with PMI vectors,,
We tokenize and POS-tag this corpus, then lemmatize it with TreeTagger CITATION to merge singular and plural instances of words and phrases (some dogs is mapped to some dog),,
On the other hand, recent studies (Geffet and Dagan, 25 \x0c2005; CITATION; CITATION) have pursued the intuition that entailment is the asymmetric ability of one term to substitute for another,,
rds tend to share similar contexts, DS has been very successful in tasks that require quantifying semantic similarity among words, such as synonym detection and concept clustering CITATION,,
The success of DS in lexical semantics has validated the hypothesis that semantically similar expressions occur in similar contexts (CITATION; CITATION; CITATION; CITATION; CITATION),,
Finally, the hypothesis that entailment among nouns is reflected by distributional inclusion among their semantic vectors CITATION is supported both by the successful generalization of the SVM classifier trained on AN |= N pairs and by the good performance of the balAPinc measure,,
This suggests that the vector pairs representing entailment between nouns are also in an inclusion relation, supporting the conjectures of CITATION and others,,
We then took the Cartesian product of these 256 adjectives with the 200 concrete nouns in the BLESS data set CITATION,,
