This is the way the Maximum Entropy tagger CITATION runs if one uses the binary version from the website (see the comparison in Section 5),,
We have chosen the Maximum Entropy tagger CITATION for a comparison with our universal tagger, since it achieved (by a small margin) the best overall result on Slovene as reported there (86.360% on all tokens) of taggers available to us (MBT, the best overall, was not freely available to us at the time of writing),,

1 Full Morphological Tagging English Part of Speech (POS) tagging has been widely described in the recent past, starting with the CITATION paper, followed by numerous others using various methods: neural networks (Julian CITATION), HMM tagging CITATION, decision trees CITATION, transformation-based error-driven learning CITATION, and maximum entropy CITATION, to selectjust a few,,
