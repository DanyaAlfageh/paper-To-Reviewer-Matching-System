 1 Full Morphological Tagging English Part of Speech (POS) tagging has been widely described in the recent past, starting with the CITATION paper, followed by numerous others using various methods: neural networks (Julian CITATION), HMM tagging CITATION, decision trees CITATION, transformation-based error-driven learning CITATION, and maximum entropy CITATION, to selectjust a few,,
 Obviously we can limit the number of tags to the major part-of-speech classes, plus some (like the Xerox Language Tools CITATION for such languages do), and in fact achieve similar performance, but that limits the usefulness of the results thus obtained for further analysis,,

 There have been attempts to solve this problem for some of the highly inflectional European languages (CITATION, CITATION, CITATION, and also our own in (Haji~ and Hladk~, 1997), (Haji~ and Hladk~, 1998), see also below), but so far no method nor a tagger has been evaluated against a larger number of those languages in a similar setting, to allow for a side-byside comparison of the difficulty (or ease) of full morphological tagging of those languages,,

3 Tagger Comparison The work CITATION consistently compares several taggers (HMM, Brill\'s Transformationbased Tagger, Ratnaparkhi\'s Maximum Entropy tagger, and the Daelemans et al,,
 We have chosen the Maximum Entropy tagger CITATION for a comparison with our universal tagger, since it achieved (by a small margin) the best overall result on Slovene as reported there (86,,
 The most detailed account of Slovene CITATION reports various results, which might not be directly comparable because it is unclear whether they use the all-tokens-based or words-only computation of the error rate,,

 This is the way the Maximum Entropy tagger CITATION runs if one uses the binary version from the website (see the comparison in Section 5),,
