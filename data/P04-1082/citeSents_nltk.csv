egories Richard CAMPBELL Microsoft Research One Microsoft Way Redmond, WA 98052 USA richcamp@microsoft.com Abstract This paper describes an algorithm for detecting empty nodes in the Penn Treebank CITATION, finding their antecedents, and assigning them function tags, without access to lexical information such as valency.,,
Unlike previous approaches to this task, the current method is not corpus-based, but rather makes use of the principles of early Government-Binding theory CITATION, the syntactic theory that underlies the annotation.,,
Using the evaluation metric proposed by CITATION, this approach outperforms previously published approaches on both detection of empty categories and antecedent identification, given either annotated input stripped of empty categories or the output of a parser.,,

5 Evaluation Following CITATION, the system was evaluated on two different kinds of input: first, on perfect input, i.e., PTB annotations stripped of all empty categories and information related to them; and second, on imperfect input, in this case the output of Charniaks (2000) parser.,,
