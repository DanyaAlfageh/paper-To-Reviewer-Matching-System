Previous approaches to the problem (CITATION; CITATION; CITATIONa,b; Higgins, 2003) have all been learning-based; the primary difference between the present algorithm and earlier ones is that it is not learned, but explicitly incorporates principles of GovernmentBinding theory CITATION, since that theory underlies the annotation,,
CITATION) typically provide a labeled bracketing only; i.e., a parse tree without empty categories,,
CITATION Model 3 integrates the detection and resolution of WH-traces in relative clauses into a lexicalized PCFG,,
CITATION proposes a pattern-matching algorithm, in which the minimal connected tree fragments containing an empty node and its antecedent(s) are extracted from the training corpus, and matched at runtime to an input tree,,
