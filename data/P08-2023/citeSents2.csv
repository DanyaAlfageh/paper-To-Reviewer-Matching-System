In the feature-based framework, CITATION employed ME,,
CITATION extended this work to estimate similarity between augmented dependency trees,,
Later, Zhang et al (2006) developed a composite kernel that combined parse tree kernel with entity kernel and CITATION experimented with a context-sensitive kernel by automatically determining context-sensitive tree spans,,
The above two work was further advanced by CITATION who argued that the information to extract a relation between two entities can be typically captured by the shortest path between them in the dependency graph,,
