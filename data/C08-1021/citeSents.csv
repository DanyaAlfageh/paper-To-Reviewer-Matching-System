XWN CITATION: This resource uses the direct relations encoded in eXtended WN,,
3.1 SSI-Dijkstra We have implemented a version of the Structural Semantic Interconnections algorithm (SSI), a knowledge-based iterative approach to Word Sense Disambiguation CITATION,,
spSemCor CITATION: This resource contains the selectional preferences acquired for subjects and objects from SemCor,,
TSSEM CITATION: These Topic Signatures have been constructed using SemCor.For each word-sense appearing in SemCor, we gather all sentences for that word sense, building a TS using TFIDF for all word-senses co-occurring in those sentences,,
Inspired by the work of CITATION, TSWEB was constructed using monosemous relatives from WN (synonyms, hypernyms, direct and indirect hyponyms, and siblings), querying Google and retrieving up to one thousand snippets per query (that is, a word sense), extracting the salient words with distinctive frequency using TFIDF,,
 2001), large collections of semantic preferences acquired from SemCor (CITATION; CITATION) or acquired from British National Corpus (BNC) CITATION, large-scale Topic Signatures for each synset acquired from the web (Agirre and de Lacalle, 2004) or knowledge about individuals from Wikipedia CITATION,,
spBNC CITATION: This resource contains 707,618 selectional preferences acquired for subjects and objects from BNC,,
TSSEM CITATION: These Topic Signatures have been constructed using SemCor.For each word-sense appearing in SemCor, we gather all sentences for that word sense, b,,
MCR CITATION: This resource integrates the direct relations of WN, XWN and spSemCor,,
As expected, each semantic resource has different volume and accuracy figures when evaluated in a common and controlled framework CITATION,,
2 Topic Signatures Topic Signatures (TS) are word vectors related to a particular topic CITATION,,
MCR CITATION: This resource integrates the direct relations o,,
In fact, WordNet is being used world-wide for anchoring different types of semantic knowledge including wordnets for languages other than English CITATION, domain knowledge CITATION or ontologies like SUMO CITATION or the EuroWordNet Top Concept Ontology CITATION,,
161 \x0ction eXtended WordNet CITATION, large collections of semantic preferences acquired from SemCor (CITATION; CITATION) or acquired from British National Corpus (BNC) CITATION, large-scale Topic Signatures for each synset acquired from the web (Agirre and de Lacalle, 2004) or knowledge about individuals from Wikipedia CITATION,,
4 Evaluation framework In order to empirically establish the relative quality of these new semantic resources, we used the evaluation framework of task 16 of SemEval-2007: Evaluation of wide coverage knowledge resources CITATION,,
