3.1 SSI-Dijkstra We have implemented a version of the Structural Semantic Interconnections algorithm (SSI), a knowledge-based iterative approach to Word Sense Disambiguation CITATION,,0

TSSEM CITATION: These Topic Signatures have been constructed using SemCor.For each word-sense appearing in SemCor, we gather all sentences for that word sense, building a TS using TFIDF for all word-senses co-occurring in those sentences,,0
Inspired by the work of CITATION, TSWEB was constructed using monosemous relatives from WN (synonyms, hypernyms, direct and indirect hyponyms, and siblings), querying Google and retrieving up to one thousand snippets per query (that is, a word sense), extracting the salient words with distinctive frequency using TFIDF,,0

4 Evaluation framework In order to empirically establish the relative quality of these new semantic resources, we used the evaluation framework of task 16 of SemEval-2007: Evaluation of wide coverage knowledge resources CITATION,,1
