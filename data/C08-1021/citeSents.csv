Inspired by the work of CITATION, TSWEB was constructed using monosemous relatives from WN (synonyms, hypernyms, direct and indirect hyponyms, and siblings), querying Google and retrieving up to one thousand snippets per query (that is, a word sense), extracting the salient words with distinctive frequency using TFIDF,,
