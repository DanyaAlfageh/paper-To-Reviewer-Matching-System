Chapter 4 of the Penn Treebank tagging guidelines CITATION contains an extensive description of the kinds of empty nodes and the use of co-indexation in the Penn Treebank.,,
Evaluating the algorithm on the output of Charniaks parser CITATION and the Penn treebank CITATION shows that the patternmatching algorithm does surprisingly well on the most frequently occuring types of empty nodes given its simplicity.,,
Then as is standard, the precision P, recall R and f-score f are calculated as follows: P = |G T| |T| R = |G T| |G| f = 2 P R P + R Table 3 provides these measures for two different test corpora: (i) a version of section 23 of the Penn Treebank from which empty nodes, indices and unary branching chains consisting of nodes of the same category were removed, and (ii) the trees produced by Charniaks parser on the strings of section 23 CITATION.,,
The parser output was produced by Charniaks parser CITATION.,,
Broad coverage syntactic parsers with good performance have recently become available (CITATION; CITATION), but these typically produce as output a parse tree that only encodes local syntactic information, i.e., a tree that does not include any empty nodes.,,
(CITATION discusses the recovery of one kind of empty node, viz., WH-traces).,,

Pattern matching and substitution can be defined more rigorously using tree automata CITATION, but for reasons of space these definitions are not given here.,,
It can also be regarded as a kind of tree transformation, so the overall system architecture (including the parser) is an instance of the transform-detransform approach advocated by CITATION.,,

This is a standard technique for discounting success probabilities from small sample size data CITATION.,,
