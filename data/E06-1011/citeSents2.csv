Online learning algorithms have been shown to be robust even with approximate rather than exact inference in problems such as word alignment CITATION, sequence analysis (DaumCITATION; CITATIONa) and phrase-structure parsing CITATION,,
We use the common method of setting the final weight vector as the average of the weight vectors after each iteration CITATION, which has been shown to alleviate overfitting,,
The algorithm is an extension of the Margin Infused Relaxed Algorithm (MIRA) CITATION to learning with structured outputs, in the present case dependency structures,,
est scoring tree (CITATIONb) or even all possible trees by using factored representations (CITATION; CITATIONc),,
We parse this instance to obtain a predicted dependency graph, and find the smallest-norm update to the weight vector w that ensures that the training graph outscores the predicted graph by a margin proportional to the loss of the predicted graph relative to the training graph, which is the number of words with incorrect parents in the predicted tree (CITATIONb),,
This algorithm can thus be viewed as a large-margin version of the perceptron algorithm for structured outputs CITATION,,
