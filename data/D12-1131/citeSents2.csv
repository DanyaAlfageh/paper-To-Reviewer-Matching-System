Skip-chain CRFs and collective inference have been applied to problems in IE, and RMNs to named entity recognition (NER) CITATION,,
The most similar models to our work are skip-chain CRFs CITATION, relational markov networks CITATION, and collective inference with symmetric clique potentials CITATION,,
Another line of work that integrates corpus-level declarative information into sentence-level models includes the posterior regularization (CITATION; CITATION), generalized expectation (CITATION; Mann and McCallum, ), and Ba,,
CITATION also integrated non-local information into entity annotation algorithms using Gibbs sampling,,
