 We did not used any post-processing methods described by CITATION (unambiguous gazetteer chunker, heuristic chunker) because they were tuned for the specific set of NE categories,,
 In the first more common CITATION schema, all PNs are divided into four MUC categories, i,,
pl/liner2 schema, assuming a separate phases for PN recognition and classification CITATION, we mapped all the PN categories to a single category, namely NAM,,
 However, in some NLP tasks like recognition of semantic relations between PNs CITATION, coreference resolution (CITATION; CITATIONa), machine translation (CITATIONa) or sensitive data anonymization (CITATIONb) the recall is much more important than the fine-grained categorization of PNs,,

 According to the ACE (Automatic Content Extraction) English Annotation Guidelines for Entities CITATION there are several types of named entities, including: proper names, definite descriptions and noun phrases,,
 CITATION presented a hybrid model (a statistical model combined with some heuristics) which obtained 70,,
44% precision for a limited set of PN categories (first names, last names, names of countries, cities and roads) tested on the CEN corpus1 CITATION,,

1 Extended gazetteer features The reference model CITATION uses only five gazetteers of PNs (first names, last names, names of countries, cities and roads),,
 In order to avoid this problem we used an unambiguous gazetteer look-up CITATION,,
