 We use Bikels implementation CITATION of Collins parser CITATION in order to carry out these experiments, using the non-deficient Collins settings,,
2 NP Bracketing Results With our new data set, we began running experiments similar to those carried out in the literature CITATION,,
 We draw our counts from a corpus of n-gram counts calculated over 1 trillion words from the web CITATION,,
 We used the PARC700 Dependency Bank CITATION which consists of 700 Section 23 sentences annotated with labelled dependencies,,
 We use the CITATION version of DepBank, a 560 sentence subset used to evaluate the RASP parser,,
 We map the brackets to dependencies by finding the head of the NP, using the CITATION head finding rules, and then creating a dependency between each other childs head and this head,,
 We check the correctness of the corpus by measuring interannotator agreement, by reannotating the first section, and by comparing against the sub-NP structure in DepBank CITATION,,
 Finally, we test the utility of the extended Treebank for training statistical models on two tasks: NP bracketing (CITATION; CITATION) and full parsing CITATION,,

1 Annotation Process Our annotation guidelines1 are based on those developed for annotating full sub-NP structure in the biomedical domain CITATION,,
 CITATION has demonstrated superior performance of the dependency model using a test set of 244 (216 unique) noun compounds drawn from Groliers encyclopedia,,
 CITATION derive estimates from web counts, and only compare at a lexical level, achieving 78,,
 CITATION also use web counts, but incorporate additional counts from several variations on simple bigram queries, including queries for the pairs of words concatenated or joined by a hyphen,,

kground The NP bracketing task has often been posed in terms of choosing between the left or right branching structure of three word noun compounds: (a) (world (oil prices)) Right-branching (b) ((crude oil) prices) Left-branching Most approaches to the problem use unsupervised methods, based on competing association strength between two of the words in the compound (CITATION, p,,
