synchronous tree substitution grammar (STSG) CITATION,,
Nevertheless, CITATION report that 5% of the sentence pairs in an aligned parallel ChineseEnglish corpus contained inside-out alignments,,
Inside-out alignments (Wu, 1997), such as the one in Example 1.3, cannot be induced by any of these theories; in fact, there seems to be no useful synchronous grammar formalisms available that handle inside-out alignments, with the possible exceptions of synchronous tree-adjoining grammars CITATION, CITATION and generalized multitext grammars CITATION, which are all way more complex than ITG, STSG and (2,2)-BRCG,,
