 It modifies the original CYK algorithm CITATION in four ways: (i) It uses two charts; one for the source string (s) and one for the target string (t),,
 The first point is motivated by studies such as CITATION and simply reflects that in order to induce multiword translation units in this kind of synchronous grammars, it is useful to be able to introduce multiple terminals simultaneously,,
