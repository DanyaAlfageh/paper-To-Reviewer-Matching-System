Transliteration of a name, for the purpose of this work, is defined as its transcription in a different language, preserving the phonetics, perhaps in a different orthography [CITATION] 1 .,,
While traditional transliteration systems have relied on hand-crafted linguistic rules, more recently, statistical machine learning techniques have been shown to be effective in transliteration tasks [CITATION] [CITATION] [Virga and Kudhanpur , 2003] [CITATION].,,
Corpus Time Period Size Articles Words New Indian Express (English) 2007.01.01 to 2007.08.31 2,359 347,050 Dinamani (Tamil) 2007.01.01 to 2007.08.31 2,359 256,456 Table 1: Statistics on Comparable Corpora From the above corpora, we first extracted all the NEs from the English side, using the Stanford NER tool [CITATION].,,

6 Related Work Our work essentially follows a similar procedure as reported in [CITATION] paper, but applied to English-Tamil language pair.,,
[CITATION] outlined methodologies based on time distribution of terms in a corpus to identify NEs, but only in English.,,
While a large body of literature exists on transliteration, we merely point out that the focus of this work (based on [CITATION]) is not on transliteration, but mining transliteration pairs, which may be used for developing a transliteration system.,,
4.2 Classifier for Transliteration Pair Identification We used SVM-light [CITATION], a Supportvector Machine (SVM) from Cornell University, to identify near transliterations between English and Tamil.,,

While traditional transliteration systems have relied on hand-crafted linguistic rules, more recently, statistical machine learning techniques have been shown to be effective in transliteration tasks [CITATION] [CITATION] [Virga and Kudhanpur , 2003] [CITATION].,,
We adopt a methodology parallel to that of [CITATION], but we focus instead on mining parallel named entity transliteration pairs, using a well-trained linear classifier to identify transliteration pairs.,,
Recently, [CITATION] outlined an approach by leveraging the availability of articlealigned news corpora between English and Russian, and tools in English, for discovering transliteration pairs between the two languages, and progressively refining the discovery process.,,
As in [CITATION] no language specific knowledge was used to refine our mining process, making the approach broadly applicable.,,
2 Transliteration Pairs Discovery In this section, we outline briefly the methodology presented in [CITATION], and refer interested readers to the source for details.,,
3 Adoption for Transliteration Pairs Mining We adopt the basic methodology presented in [CITATION], but we focus on three specific issues described in the introduction.,,
3.1 Mining of Transliteration Pairs We start with comparable corpora in English and Tamil, similar in size to that used in [CITATION], and using the English side of this corpora, first, we extract all the NEs that occur more than a given threshold parameter, FE, using a standard NER tool.,,
5 Open Issues in NE pair Mining In this paper, we outline our experience in mining parallel NEs between English and Tamil, in an approach similar to the one discussed in [CITATION].,,
