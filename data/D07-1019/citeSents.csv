Traditionally candidate ranking is based on manually tuned scores such as assigning alternative weights to different edit operations or leveraging candidate frequencies (CITATION; CITATION),,
CITATION presented an improved error model over the one proposed by (Kernighan et al., 1990) by allowing generic string-to-string edit operations, which helps with modeling major cognitive errors such as the confusion between le and al,,
Via explicit modeling of phonetic information of English words, CITATION further investigated this issue,,
Actually misspelled queries are rather commonly observed in query logs, as shown in previous investigations into the search engines log data that around 10%~15% queries were misspelled CITATION,,
CITATION first investigated this issue and proposed to use query logs to infer correct spellings of misspelled terms,,
Using a pre-defined confusion set is a common strategy for this task, such as in the work of CITATION and (Mangu and Brill, 1997),,
The complexity of query spelling correction task requires the combination of these types of evidence, as done in (CITATION; CITATION),,
This task can leverage conventional spelling correction methods such as generating candidates based on edit distance CITATION or phonetic similarity CITATION,,

s can be optimized using the numerical optimization algorithms such as the Generalized Iterative Scaling (GIS) algorithm CITATION by maximizing the posterior probability of the training set which contains a manually labeled set of query-truth pairs: = argmax c,q log Pr (c|q) (3) The advantage of maximum entropy model is that it provides a natural way and unified framework to integrate all available information sources,,

There has been a long history of general-purpose spelling correction research in natural language processing and information retrieval literature CITATION, but its application to web search 181 \x0cquery is still a new challenge,,
