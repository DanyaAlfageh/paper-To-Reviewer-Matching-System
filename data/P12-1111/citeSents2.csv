Based on experiments carried out 1 Our implementation of this feature set is basically the same as the version used in CITATION,,
We adopt the basic feature set used in CITATION and CITATION,,
This replicates the feature set B used in CITATION,,
Our baseline model, which uses CITATIONs feature set and conducts a beam (=5) search in the unconstrained,,
In CITATION, lookahead features may be available for use during decoding since searching is bidirectional instead of left-to-right as in Viterbi decoding,,
parameter estimation of , we use the averaged perceptron as described in CITATION,,

The baseline for speed in all cases is the unconstrained tagger using CITATIONs feature and conducting a beam (=5) search,,
As introduced in Section 2.2, we adopt a very compact feature set used in CITATION1,,
As discussed in CITATION, categorical information of neighbouring words on both sides of w0 help resolve POS ambiguity of w0,,
