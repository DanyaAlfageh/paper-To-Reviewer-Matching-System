It has been successfully applied to German-toEnglish and Chinese-to-English SMT (CITATION; CITATION),,
Similarly, for Arabic-to-English, CITATION, and CITATION show that various segmentation schemes lead to improvements that decrease with increasing parallel corpus size.,,
We then proceed to split the data into smaller sentences and tag them using Ratnaparkhis Maximum Entropy Tagger CITATION,,
Similarly, for Arabic-to-English, CITATION, and CITATION show that various segmentation schemes lead to improvements that decrease with in,,
CITATION present a similar approach, with a notable difference: the re-ordering rules are automatically learned from aligning parse trees for both the source and target sentences,,
e segmented Arabic target using the standard MOSES CITATION configuration of GIZA++ CITATION, which is IBM Model 4, and decoding is done using the phrasebased SMT system MOSES,,
CITATION) that morphological segmentation of Arabic improves the translation performance for both Arabic-to-English and English-to-Arabic by addressing the problem of sparsity of the Arabic side,,
CITATION enrich the English side by adding a feature to the Factored Model that models noun case agreement and verb person conjugation, and show that it leads t,,
Much like CITATION, we parse the English side of our corpora and reorder using predefined rules,,
4 Preprocessing Techniques 4.1 Arabic Segmentation and Recombination It has been shown previously work (CITATION; CITATION) that morphological segment,,
rk CITATION that syntactic reordering does not improve translation if the parse quality is not good enough,,
CITATION propose Factored Translation Models, which extend phrase-based statistical machine translation by allowing the integration of additional morphological features at the word level,,
Similarly, for Arabic-to-English, CITATION, and CITATION show that various segmentation schemes lead to improvements that decrease with increasing parallel corpus size,,
CITATION automatically learns syntactic reordering rules that are then applied to the Arabic side of the parallel corpora,,
90 \x0cThe English source is aligned to the segmented Arabic target using the standard MOSES CITATION configuration of GIZA++ CITATION, which is IBM Model 4, and decoding is done using the phrasebased SMT system MOSES,,
90 \x0cThe English source is aligned to the segmented Arabic target using the standard MOSES CITATION configuration of GIZA++ (,,
CITATION enrich the English side by adding a feature to the Factored Model that models noun case agreement and verb person conjugation, and show that it leads to a more grammatically correct output for English-to-Greek and English-to-Czech translation,,
5 Experiments 5.1 System description For the English source, we first tokenize using the Stanford Log-linear Part-of-Speech Tagger CITATION,,
We use the Morphological Analyzer MADA CITATION to decompose the Arabic source,,
CITATION use similar methods to reorder German by looking at the POS tags for German-to-English and German-toSpanish,,
We tune using Ochs algorithm CITATION to optimize weights for the distortion model, language model, phrase translation model and word penalty over the BLEU metric CITATION,,
90 \x0cThe English source is aligned to the segmented Arabic target using the standard MOSES CITATION configuration of GIZA++ CITATION, which is IBM Model 4, and decoding is do,,
The only works on Englishto-Arabic SMT that we are aware of are CITATION, and CITATION,,
Morphological segmentation has been shown to benefit Arabic-to-English CITATION and English-to-Arabic CITATION translation, although the gains tend to decrease with increasing training data size,,
4 Preprocessing Techniques 4.1 Arabic Segmentation and Recombination It has been shown previously work (CITATION; CITATION) that morphological segmentation of Arabic improves the translation performance for both Arabic-to-English and English-to-Arabic by addressing the problem of sparsity of the Arabic side,,
We use the Morphological Analyzer MADA (CITATION,,
Most relevant to the approach in this paper are CITATION and CITATION,,
mum Entropy Tagger CITATION,,
It has been noted in previous work CITATION that syntactic reordering does not improve translation if the parse quality is not good enough,,
They use a trigram language model and the Arabic morphological analyzer MADA CITATION respectively, to segment the Arabic side of their corpora,,
We parse the data using the Collins Parser CITATION, and then tag person, location and organization names using the Stanford Named Entity Recognizer CITATION,,
