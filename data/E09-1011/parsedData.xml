Syntactic Reordering of the source lan-
guage to better match the phrase struc-
ture of the target language has been
shown to improve the performance of
phrase-based Statistical Machine Transla-
tion. This paper applies syntactic reorder-
ing to English-to-Arabic translation. It in-
troduces reordering rules, and motivates
them linguistically. It also studies the ef-
fect of combining reordering with Ara-
bic morphological segmentation, a pre-
processing technique that has been shown
to improve Arabic-English and English-
Arabic translation. We report on results in
the news text domain, the UN text domain
and in the spoken travel domain.

Phrase-based Statistical Machine Translation has

proven to be a robust and effective approach to
machine translation, providing good performance
without the need for explicit linguistic informa-
tion. Phrase-based SMT systems, however, have
limited capabilities in dealing with long distance
phenomena, since they rely on local alignments.
Automatically learned reordering models, which
can be conditioned on lexical items from both the
source and the target, provide some limited re-
ordering capability when added to SMT systems.
One approach that explicitly deals with long
distance reordering is to reorder the source side
to better match the target side, using predefined
rules. The reordered source is then used as input
to the phrase-based SMT system. This approach
indirectly incorporates structure information since
the reordering rules are applied on the parse trees
of the source sentence. Obviously, the same re-
ordering has to be applied to both training data and
test data. Despite the added complexity of parsing
the data, this technique has shown improvements,
especially when good parses of the source side ex-
ist. It has been successfully applied to German-to-
English and Chinese-to-English SMT (Collins et
al., 2005; Wang et al., 2007).
In this paper, we propose the use of a similar
approach for English-to-Arabic SMT. Unlike most
other work on Arabic translation, our work is in
the direction of the more morphologically com-
plex language, which poses unique challenges. We
propose a set of syntactic reordering rules on the
English source to align it better to the Arabic tar-
get. The reordering rules exploit systematic differ-
ences between the syntax of Arabic and the syntax
of English; they specifically address two syntac-
tic constructs. The first is the Subject-Verb order
in independent sentences, where the preferred or-
der in written Arabic is Verb-Subject. The sec-
ond is the noun phrase structure, where many dif-
ferences exist between the two languages, among
them the order of adjectives, compound nouns
and genitive constructs, as well as the way defi-
niteness is marked. The implementation of these
rules is fairly straightforward since they are ap-
plied to the parse tree. It has been noted in previ-
ous work (Habash, 2007) that syntactic reordering
does not improve translation if the parse quality is
not good enough. Since in this paper our source
language is English, the parses are more reliable,
and result in more correct reorderings. We show
that using the reordering rules results in gains in
the translation scores and study the effect of the
training data size on those gains.
This paper also investigates the effect of using
morphological segmentation of the Arabic target

\x0cin combination with the reordering rules. Mor-
phological segmentation has been shown to benefit
Arabic-to-English (Habash and Sadat, 2006) and
English-to-Arabic (Badr et al., 2008) translation,
although the gains tend to decrease with increas-
ing training data size.
Section 2 provides linguistic motivation for the
paper. It describes the rich morphology of Arabic,
and its implications on SMT. It also describes the
syntax of the verb phrase and noun phrase in Ara-
bic, and how they differ from their English coun-
terparts. In Section 3, we describe some of the rel-
evant previous work. In Section 4, we present the
preprocessing techniques used in the experiments.
Section 5 describes the translation system, the data
used, and then presents and discusses the experi-
mental results from three domains: news text, UN
data and spoken dialogue from the travel domain.
The final section provides a brief summary and
conclusion.

2.1 Arabic Morphology
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.996294181818182">
Arabic has a complex morphology compared to
English. The Arabic noun and adjective are in-
flected for gender and number; the verb is inflected
in addition for tense, voice, mood and person.
Various clitics can attach to words as well: Con-
junctions, prepositions and possessive pronouns
attach to nouns, and object pronouns attach to
verbs. The example below shows the decompo-
sition into stems and clitics of the Arabic verb
phrase wsyqAblhm1 and noun phrase wbydh, both
of which are written as one word:

An Arabic corpus will, therefore, have more
surface forms than an equivalent English corpus,
and will also be sparser. In the LDC news corpora
used in this paper (see Section 5.2), the average
English sentence length is 33 words compared to
the Arabic 25 words.

All examples in this paper are writ-
ten in the Buckwalter Transliteration System
(http://www.qamus.org/transliteration.htm)
Although the Arabic language family consists
of many dialects, none of them has a standard
orthography. This affects the consistency of the
orthography of Modern Standard Arabic (MSA),
the only written variety of Arabic. Certain char-
acters are written inconsistently in different data
sources: Final y is sometimes written as Y (Alif
mqSwrp), and initial Alif hamza (The Buckwal-
ter characters &lt; and {) are written as bare alif
(A). Arabic is usually written without the diacritics
that denote short vowels. This creates an ambigu-
ity at the word level, since a word can have more
than one reading. These factors adversely affect
the performance of Arabic-to-English SMT, espe-
cially in the English-to-Arabic direction.
Simple pattern matching is not enough to per-
form morphological analysis and decomposition,
since a certain string of characters can, in princi-
ple, be either an affixed morpheme or part of the
base word itself. Word-level linguistic information
as well as context analysis are needed. For exam-
ple the written form wly can mean either ruler or
and for me, depending on the context. Only in the
latter case should it be decomposed.

In Arabic, the main sentence usually has
the order Verb-Subject-Object (VSO). The order
Subject-Verb-Object (SVO) also occurs, but is less
frequent than VSO. The verb agrees with the sub-
ject in gender and number in the SVO order, but
only in gender in the VSO order (Examples 2c and

\x0cIn a dependent clause, the order must be SVO,
as illustrated by the ungrammaticality of Exam-

this distinction between dependent and indepen-
dent clauses has to be taken into account when the
syntactic reordering rules are applied.

Noun Phrase
</figure>
<bodyText confidence="0.8799378">
The Arabic noun phrase can have constructs
that are quite different from English. The adjective
in Arabic follows the noun that it modifies, and it
is marked with the definite article, if the head noun
is definite:

The Arabic equivalent of the English posses-
sive, compound nouns and the of-relationship is
the Arabic idafa construct, which compounds two
or more nouns. Therefore, N1s N2 and N2 of N1
are both translated as N2 N1 in Arabic. As Exam-
ple 6b shows, this construct can also be chained
recursively.

The key to the door of the house
Example 6 also shows that an idafa construct is
made definite by adding the definite article Al- to
the last noun in the noun phrase. Adjectives follow
the idafa noun phrase, regardless of which noun in
the chain they modify. Thus, Example 7 is am-
biguous in that the adjective kbyr (big) can modify
any of the preceding three nouns. The same is true
for relative clauses that modify a noun.

These and other differences between the Arabic
and English syntax are likely to affect the qual-
ity of automatic alignments, since corresponding
words will occupy positions in the sentence that
are far apart, especially when the relevant words
(e.g. the verb and its subject) are separated by sub-
ordinate clauses. In such cases, the lexicalized dis-
tortion models used in phrase-based SMT do not
have the capability of performing reorderings cor-
rectly. This limitation adversely affects the trans-
lation quality.

3 Previous Work
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.991279777777778">
Most of the work in Arabic machine translation
is done in the Arabic-to-English direction. The
other direction, however, is also important, since
it opens the wealth of information in different do-
mains that is available in English to the Arabic
speaking world. Also, since Arabic is a morpho-
logically richer language, translating into Arabic
poses unique issues that are not present in the
opposite direction. The only works on English-
to-Arabic SMT that we are aware of are Badr et
al. (2008), and Sarikaya and Deng (2007). Badr
et al. show that using segmentation and recom-
bination as pre- and post- processing steps leads
to significant gains especially for smaller train-
ing data corpora. Sarikaya and Deng use Joint
Morphological-Lexical Language Models to re-
rank the output of an English-to-Arabic MT sys-
tem. They use regular expression-based segmen-
tation of the Arabic so as not to run into recombi-
nation issues on the output side.
Similarly, for Arabic-to-English, Lee (2004),
and Habash and Sadat (2006) show that vari-
ous segmentation schemes lead to improvements
that decrease with increasing parallel corpus size.
They use a trigram language model and the Ara-
bic morphological analyzer MADA (Habash and
Rambow, 2005) respectively, to segment the Ara-
bic side of their corpora. Other work on Arabic-
to-English SMT tries to address the word reorder-
ing problem. Habash (2007) automatically learns
syntactic reordering rules that are then applied to
the Arabic side of the parallel corpora. The words
are aligned in a sentence pair, then the Arabic sen-
tence is parsed to extract reordering rules based on
how the constituents in the parse tree are reordered
on the English side. No significant improvement is

\x0cshown with reordering when compared to a base-
line that uses a non-lexicalized distance reordering
model. This is attributed in the paper to the poor
quality of parsing.
Syntax-based reordering as a preprocessing step
has been applied to many language pairs other
than English-Arabic. Most relevant to the ap-
proach in this paper are Collins et al. (2005)
and Wang et al. (2007). Both parse the source
side and then reorder the sentence based on pre-
defined, linguistically motivated rules. Signifi-
cant gain is reported for German-to-English and
Chinese-to-English translation. Both suggest that
reordering as a preprocessing step results in bet-
ter alignment, and reduces the reliance on the dis-
tortion model. Popovic and Ney (2006) use sim-
ilar methods to reorder German by looking at the
POS tags for German-to-English and German-to-
Spanish. They show significant improvements on
test set sentences that do get reordered as well
as those that dont, which is attributed to the im-
provement of the extracted phrases. (Xia and
McCord, 2004) present a similar approach, with
a notable difference: the re-ordering rules are au-
tomatically learned from aligning parse trees for
both the source and target sentences. They report
a 10% relative gain for English-to-French trans-
lation. Although target-side parsing is optional
in this approach, it is needed to take full advan-
tage of the approach. This is a bigger issue when
no reliable parses are available for the target lan-
guage, as is the case in this paper. More generally,
the use of automatically-learned rules has the ad-
vantage of readily applicable to different language
pairs. The use of deterministic, pre-defined rules,
however, has the advantage of being linguistically
motivated, since differences between the two lan-
guages are addressed explicitly. Moreover, the im-
plementation of pre-defined transfer rules based
on target-side parses is relatively easy and cheap
to implement in different language pairs.
Generic approaches for translating from En-
glish to more morphologically complex languages
have been proposed. Koehn and Hoang (2007)
propose Factored Translation Models, which ex-
tend phrase-based statistical machine translation
by allowing the integration of additional morpho-
logical features at the word level. They demon-
strate improvements for English-to-German and
English-to-Czech. Tighter integration of fea-
tures is claimed to allow for better modeling of
the morphology and hence is better than using
pre-processing and post-processing techniques.
Avramidis and Koehn (2008) enrich the English
side by adding a feature to the Factored Model that
models noun case agreement and verb person con-
jugation, and show that it leads to a more gram-
matically correct output for English-to-Greek and
English-to-Czech translation. Although Factored
Models are well equipped for handling languages
that differ in terms of morphology, they still use
the same distortion reordering model as a phrase-
based MT system.

4.1 Arabic Segmentation and Recombination
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999116361111111">
It has been shown previously work (Badr et al.,
2008; Habash and Sadat, 2006) that morphologi-
cal segmentation of Arabic improves the transla-
tion performance for both Arabic-to-English and
English-to-Arabic by addressing the problem of
sparsity of the Arabic side. In this paper, we use
segmented and non-segmented Arabic on the tar-
get side, and study the effect of the combination of
segmentation with reordering.
As mentioned in Section 2.1, simple pattern
matching is not enough to decompose Arabic
words into stems and affixes. Lexical information
and context are needed to perform the decompo-
sition correctly. We use the Morphological Ana-
lyzer MADA (Habash and Rambow, 2005) to de-
compose the Arabic source. MADA uses SVM-
based classifiers of features (such as POS, num-
ber, gender, etc.) to score the different analyses
of a given word in context. We apply morpho-
logical decomposition before aligning the training
data. We split the conjunction and preposition pre-
fixes, as well as possessive and object pronoun suf-
fixes. We then glue the split morphemes into one
prefix and one suffix, such that any given word is
split into at most three parts: prefix+ stem +suffix.
Note that plural markers and subject pronouns are
not split. For example, the word wlAwlAdh (and
for his children) is segmented into wl+ AwlAd
+P:3MS.
Since training is done on segmented Arabic, the
output of the decoder must be recombined into its
original surface form. We follow the approach of
Badr et. al (2008) in combining the Arabic out-
put, which is a non-trivial task for several reasons.
First, the ending of a stem sometimes changes
when a suffix is attached to it. Second, word end-

\x0cings are normalized to remove orthographic incon-
sistency between different sources (Section 2.1).
Finally, some words can recombine into more than
one grammatically correct form. To address these
issues, a lookup table is derived from the training
data that maps the segmented form of the word to
its original form. The table is also useful in re-
combining words that are erroneously segmented.
If a certain word does not occur in the table, we
back off to a set of manually defined recombina-
tion rules. Word ambiguity is resolved by picking
the more frequent surface form.

4.2 Arabic Reordering Rules
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.965787133333333">
This section presents the syntax-based rules used
for re-ordering the English source to better match
the syntax of the Arabic target. These rules are
motivated by the Arabic syntactic facts described
in Section 2.2.
Much like Wang et al. (2007), we parse the En-
glish side of our corpora and reorder using prede-
fined rules. Reordering the English can be done
more reliably than other source languages, such
as Arabic, Chinese and German, since the state-
of-the-art English parsers are considerably better
than parsers of other languages. The following
rules for reordering at the sentence level and the
noun phrase level are applied to the English parse
tree:
</bodyText>
<listItem confidence="0.861672">
1. NP: All nouns, adjectives and adverbs in the
noun phrase are inverted. This rule is moti-
vated by the order of the adjective with re-
spect to its head noun, as well as the idafa
construct (see Examples 6 and 7 in Section
2.2. As a result of applying this rule, the
phrase the blank computer screen becomes
the screen computer blank .
2. PP: All prepositional phrases of the form
</listItem>
<equation confidence="0.938131">
N1 ofN2 ...ofNn are transformed to
N1 N2 ...Nn. All Ni are also made indefi-
</equation>
<bodyText confidence="0.9665879">
nite, and the definite article is added to Nn,
the last noun in the chain. For example, the
phrase the general chief of staff of the armed
forces becomes general chief staff the armed
forces. We also move all adjectives in the
top noun phrase to the end of the construct.
So the real value of the Egyptian pound
becomes value the Egyptian pound real. This
rule is motivated by the idafa construct and
its properties (see Example 6).
</bodyText>
<listItem confidence="0.758768">
3. the: The definite article the is replicated be-

<bodyText confidence="0.9327908">
fore adjectives (see Example 5 above). So the
blank computer screen becomes the blank the
computer the screen. This rule is applied af-
ter NP rule abote. Note that we do not repli-
cate the before proper names.
4. VP: This rule transforms SVO sentences to
VSO. All verbs are reordered on the condi-
tion that they have their own subject noun
phrase and are not in the participle form,
since in these cases the Arabic subject occurs
before the verb participle. We also check that
the verb is not in a relative clause with a that
complementizer (Example 3 above). The fol-
lowing example illustrates all these cases: the
health minister stated that 11 police officers
were wounded in clashes with the demonstra-
tors stated the health minister that 11 po-
lice officers were wounded in clashes with the
demonstrators. If the verb is negated, the
negative particle is moved with the verb (Ex-
ample 4. Finally, if the object of the reordered
verb is a pronoun, it is reordered with the
verb. Example: the authorities gave us all
the necessary help becomes gave us the au-
thorities all the necessary help.
The transformation rules 1, 2 and 3 are applied
in this order, since they interact although they do
not conflict. So, the real value of the Egyptian
pound value the Egyptian the pound the real
The VP reordering rule is independent.

For the English source, we first tokenize us-

ger (Toutanova et al., 2003). We then proceed
to split the data into smaller sentences and tag
them using Ratnaparkhis Maximum Entropy Tag-
ger (Ratnaparkhi, 1996). We parse the data us-
ing the Collins Parser (Collins, 1997), and then
tag person, location and organization names us-
ing the Stanford Named Entity Recognizer (Finkel
et al., 2005). On the Arabic side, we normalize
the data by changing final Y to y, and chang-
ing the various forms of Alif hamza to bare Alif,
since these characters are written inconsistently in
some Arabic sources. We then segment the data
using MADA according to the scheme explained
in Section 4.1.

\x0cThe English source is aligned to the seg-
mented Arabic target using the standard
MOSES (MOSES, 2007) configuration of
GIZA++ (Och and Ney, 2000), which is IBM
Model 4, and decoding is done using the phrase-
based SMT system MOSES. We use a maximum
phrase length of 15 to account for the increase
in length of the segmented Arabic. We also
use a lexicalized bidirectional reordering model
conditioned on both the source and target sides,
with a distortion limit set to 6. We tune using
Ochs algorithm (Och, 2003) to optimize weights
for the distortion model, language model, phrase
translation model and word penalty over the
BLEU metric (Papineni et al., 2001). For the
segmented Arabic experiments, we experiment
with tuning using non-segmented Arabic as a
reference. This is done by recombining the output
before each tuning iteration is scored and has been
shown by Badr et. al (2008) to perform better than
using segmented Arabic as reference.

5.2 Data Used
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.99955932">
We report results on three domains: newswire text,
UN data and spoken dialogue from the travel do-
main. It is important to note that the sentences
in the travel domain are much shorter than in the
news domain, which simplifies the alignment as
well as reordering during decoding. Also, since
the travel domain contains spoken Arabic, it is
more biased towards the Subject-Verb-Object sen-
tence order than the Verb-Subject-Object order
more common in the news domain. Also note
that since most of our data was originally intended
for Arabic-to-English translation, our test and tun-
ing sets have only one reference, and therefore,
the BLEU scores we report are lower than typi-
cal scores reported in the literature on Arabic-to-
English.
The news training data consists of several LDC
corpora2. We construct a test set by randomly
picking 2000 sentences. We pick another 2000
sentences randomly for tuning. Our final training
set consists of 3 million English words. We also
test on the NIST MT 05 test set while tuning on
both the NIST MT 03 and 04 test sets. We use the
first English reference of the NIST test sets as the
source, and the Arabic source as our reference. For

the language model, we use 35 million words from
the LDC Arabic Gigaword corpus, plus the Arabic
side of the 3 million word training corpus. Exper-
imentation with different language model orders
shows that the optimal model orders are 4-grams
for the baseline system and 6-grams for the seg-
mented Arabic. The average sentence length is 33
for English, 25 for non-segmented Arabic and 36
for segmented Arabic.
To study the effect of syntactic reordering on
larger training data sizes, we use the UN English-
Arabic parallel text (LDC2003T05). We experi-
ment with two training data sizes: 30 million and
3 million words. The test and tuning sets are
comprised of 1500 and 500 sentences respectively,
chosen at random.
For the spoken domain, we use the BTEC 2007
Arabic-English corpus. The training set consists
of 200K words, the test set has 500 sentences and
the tuning set has 500 sentences. The language
model consists of the Arabic side of the training
data. Because of the significantly smaller data
size, we use a trigram LM for the baseline, and
a 4-gram for segmented Arabic. In this case, the
average sentence length is 9 for English, 8 for Ara-
bic, and 10 for segmented Arabic.

ric. It is important to note that the gain that we
report in terms of BLEU are more significant that
comparable gains on test sets that have multiple
references, since our test sets have only one refer-
ence. Any amount of gain is a result of additional
n-gram precision with one reference. We note that
the gain achieved from the reordering of the non-
segmented and segmented systems are compara-
ble. Replicating the before adjectives hurts the
scores, possibly because it increases the sentence
length noticeably, and thus deteriorates the align-
ments quality. We note that the gains achieved by
reordering on the NIST test set are smaller than
the improvements on the random test set. This is
due to the fact that the sentences in the NIST test
set are longer, which adversely affects the parsing
quality. The average English sentence length is 33
words in the NIST test set, while the random test
set has an average sentence length of 29 words.
Table 2 shows the reordering gains of the non-
segmented Arabic by sentence length. Short sen-
tences are sentences that have less that 40 words of
English, while long sentences have more than 40
words. Out of the 1055 sentence in the NIST test
set 719 are short and 336 are long. We also report
oracle scores in Table 3 for combining the base-
line system with the reordering systems, as well
as the percentage of oracle sentences produced by
the reordered system. The oracle score is com-
puted by starting with the reordered systems can-
didate translations and iterating over all the sen-
tences one by one: we replace each sentence with
its corresponding baseline system translation then

compute the total BLEU score of the entire set. If
the score improves, then the sentence in question
is replaced with the baseline systems translation,
otherwise it remains unchanged and we move on
to the next one.
In Table 4, we report results on the UN corpus
for different training data sizes. It is important to
note that although gains from VP reordering stay
constant when scaled to larger training sets, gains
from NP+PP reordering diminish. This is due to
the fact that NP reordering tend to be more local-
ized then VP reorderings. Hence with more train-
ing data the lexicalized reordering model becomes
more effective in reordering NPs.
In Table 5, we report results on the BTEC
corpus for different segmentation and reordering
scheme combinations. We should first point out
that all sentences in the BTEC corpus are short,
simple and easy to align. Hence, the gain intro-
duced by reordering might not be enough to offset
the errors introduced by the parsing. We also note
that spoken Arabic usually prefers the Subject-
Verb-Object sentence order, rather than the Verb-
Subject-Object sentence order of written Arabic.
This explains the fact that no gain is observed
when the verb phrase is reordered. Noun phrase
reordering produces a significant gain with non-
segmented Arabic. Replicating the definite arti-
cle the in the noun phrase does not create align-
ment problems as is the case with the newswire
data, since the sentences are considerably shorter,
and hence the 0.74 point gain observed on the seg-
mented Arabic system. That gain does not trans-
late to the non-segmented Arabic system since in
that case the definite article Al remains attached to
its head word.

Generic approaches for translating from English to more morphologically complex languages have been proposed. Koehn and Hoang (2007) propose Factored Translation Models, which extend phrase-based statistical machine translation by allowing the integration of additional morphological features at the word level. They demonstrate improvements for English-to-German and English-to-Czech. Tighter integration of features is claimed to allow for better modeling of the morphology and hence is better than using pre-processing and post-processing techniques. Avramidis and Koehn (2008) enrich the English side by adding a feature to the Factored Model that models noun case agreement and verb person conjugation, and show that it leads to a more grammatically correct output for English-to-Greek and English-to-Czech translation. Although Factored Models are well equipped for handling languages that differ in terms of morphology, they still use the same distortion reordering model as a phrasebased MT system. 4 Preprocessing Techniques 4.1 Arabic Segmentation and Recombination It has been shown previously work (Badr et al., 2008; Habash and Sadat, 2006) that morphological segment</context>

Section 2 provides linguistic motivation for the paper. It describes the rich morphology of Arabic, and its implications on SMT. It also describes the syntax of the verb phrase and noun phrase in Arabic, and how they differ from their English counterparts. In Section 3, we describe some of the relevant previous work.

This limitation adversely affects the translation quality. 3 Previous Work Most of the work in Arabic machine translation is done in the Arabic-to-English direction. The other direction, however, is also important, since it opens the wealth of information in different domains that is available in English to the Arabic speaking world. Also, since Arabic is a morphologically richer language, translating into Arabic poses unique issues that are not present in the opposite direction. The only works on Englishto-Arabic SMT that we are aware of are Badr et al. (2008), and Sarikaya and Deng (2007). Badr et al. show that using segmentation and recombination as pre- and post- processing steps leads to significant gains especially for smaller training data corpora. Sarikaya and Deng use Joint Morphological-Lexical Language Models to rerank the output of an English-to-Arabic MT system. They use regular expression-based segmentation of the Arabic so as not to run into recombination issues on the output side. Similarly, for Arabic-to-English, Lee (2004), and Habash and Sadat (2006) show that various segmentation schemes lead to improvements that decrease with in</context>

In this paper, we use segmented and non-segmented Arabic on the target side, and study the effect of the combination of segmentation with reordering. As mentioned in Section 2.1, simple pattern matching is not enough to decompose Arabic words into stems and affixes. Lexical information and context are needed to perform the decomposition correctly.

The reordered source is then used as input to the phrase-based SMT system. This approach indirectly incorporates structure information since the reordering rules are applied on the parse trees of the source sentence. Obviously, the same reordering has to be applied to both training data and test data. Despite the added complexity of parsing the data, this technique has shown improvements, especially when good parses of the source side exist. It has been successfully applied to German-toEnglish and Chinese-to-English SMT (Collins et al., 2005; Wang et al., 2007). In this paper, we propose the use of a similar approach for English-to-Arabic SMT. Unlike most other work on Arabic translation, our work is in the direction of the more morphologically complex language, which poses unique challenges. We propose a set of syntactic reordering rules on the English source to align it better to the Arabic target. The reordering rules exploit systematic differences between the syntax of Arabic and the syntax of English; they specifically address two syntactic constructs. The first is the Subject-Verb order in independent sentences, where the p</context>

The words are aligned in a sentence pair, then the Arabic sentence is parsed to extract reordering rules based on how the constituents in the parse tree are reordered on the English side. No significant improvement is 88 \x0cshown with reordering when compared to a baseline that uses a non-lexicalized distance reordering model. This is attributed in the paper to the poor quality of parsing. Syntax-based reordering as a preprocessing step has been applied to many language pairs other than English-Arabic. Most relevant to the approach in this paper are Collins et al. (2005) and Wang et al. (2007). Both parse the source side and then reorder the sentence based on predefined, linguistically motivated rules. Significant gain is reported for German-to-English and Chinese-to-English translation. Both suggest that reordering as a preprocessing step results in better alignment, and reduces the reliance on the distortion model. Popovic and Ney (2006) use similar methods to reorder German by looking at the POS tags for German-to-English and German-toSpanish. They show significant improvements on test set sentences that do get reordered as well as those that dont, which i</context>

The first is the Subject-Verb order in independent sentences, where the preferred order in written Arabic is Verb-Subject. The second is the noun phrase structure, where many differences exist between the two languages, among them the order of adjectives, compound nouns and genitive constructs, as well as the way definiteness is marked. The implementation of these rules is fairly straightforward since they are applied to the parse tree. It has been noted in previous work (Habash, 2007) that syntactic reordering does not improve translation if the parse quality is not good enough. Since in this paper our source language is English, the parses are more reliable, and result in more correct reorderings. We show that using the reordering rules results in gains in the translation scores and study the effect of the training data size on those gains. This paper also investigates the effect of using morphological segmentation of the Arabic target 86 \x0cin combination with the reordering rules.

They use regular expression-based segmentation of the Arabic so as not to run into recombination issues on the output side. Similarly, for Arabic-to-English, Lee (2004), and Habash and Sadat (2006) show that various segmentation schemes lead to improvements that decrease with increasing parallel corpus size. They use a trigram language model and the Arabic morphological analyzer MADA (Habash and Rambow, 2005) respectively, to segment the Arabic side of their corpora. Other work on Arabicto-English SMT tries to address the word reordering problem.

As mentioned in Section 2.1, simple pattern matching is not enough to decompose Arabic words into stems and affixes. Lexical information and context are needed to perform the decomposition correctly. We use the Morphological Analyzer MADA (Habash and Rambow, 2005) to decompose the Arabic source. MADA uses SVMbased classifiers of features (such as POS, number, gender, etc.) to score the different analyses of a given word in context. We apply morphological decomposition before aligning the training data. We split the conjunction and preposition prefixes, as well as possessive and object pronoun suffixes. We then glue the split morphemes into one prefix and one suffix, such that any given word is split into at most three parts: prefix+ stem +suffix. Note that plural markers and subject pronouns are not split. For example, the word wlAwlAdh (and for his ch</context>

Since in this paper our source language is English, the parses are more reliable, and result in more correct reorderings. We show that using the reordering rules results in gains in the translation scores and study the effect of the training data size on those gains. This paper also investigates the effect of using morphological segmentation of the Arabic target 86 \x0cin combination with the reordering rules. Morphological segmentation has been shown to benefit Arabic-to-English (Habash and Sadat, 2006) and English-to-Arabic (Badr et al., 2008) translation, although the gains tend to decrease with increasing training data size. Section 2 provides linguistic motivation for the paper. It describes the rich morphology of Arabic, and its implications on SMT. It also describes the syntax of the verb phrase and noun phrase in Arabic, and how they differ from their English counterparts. In Section 3, we describe some of the relevant previous work.

More generally, the use of automatically-learned rules has the advantage of readily applicable to different language pairs. The use of deterministic, pre-defined rules, however, has the advantage of being linguistically motivated, since differences between the two languages are addressed explicitly. Moreover, the implementation of pre-defined transfer rules based on target-side parses is relatively easy and cheap to implement in different language pairs. Generic approaches for translating from English to more morphologically complex languages have been proposed. Koehn and Hoang (2007) propose Factored Translation Models, which extend phrase-based statistical machine translation by allowing the integration of additional morphological features at the word level. They demonstrate improvements for English-to-German and English-to-Czech. Tighter integration of features is claimed to allow for better modeling of the morphology and hence is better than using pre-processing and post-processing techniques.

The other direction, however, is also important, since it opens the wealth of information in different domains that is available in English to the Arabic speaking world. Also, since Arabic is a morphologically richer language, translating into Arabic poses unique issues that are not present in the opposite direction. The only works on Englishto-Arabic SMT that we are aware of are Badr et al. (2008), and Sarikaya and Deng (2007).

The reordered source is then used as input to the phrase-based SMT system. This approach indirectly incorporates structure information since the reordering rules are applied on the parse trees of the source sentence. Obviously, the same reordering has to be applied to both training data and test data. Despite the added complexity of parsing the data, this technique has shown improvements, especially when good parses of the source side exist. It has been successfully applied to German-toEnglish and Chinese-to-English SMT (Collins et al., 2005; Wang et al., 2007). In this paper, we propose the use of a similar approach for English-to-Arabic SMT. Unlike most other work on Arabic translation, our work is in the direction of the more morphologically complex language, which poses unique challenges. We propose a set of syntactic reordering rules on the English source to align it better to the Arabic target. The reordering rules exploit systematic differences between the syntax of Arabic and the syntax of English; they specifically address two syntactic constructs. The first is the Subject-Verb order in independent sentences, where the preferred order in wr</context>

The words are aligned in a sentence pair, then the Arabic sentence is parsed to extract reordering rules based on how the constituents in the parse tree are reordered on the English side. No significant improvement is 88 \x0cshown with reordering when compared to a baseline that uses a non-lexicalized distance reordering model. This is attributed in the paper to the poor quality of parsing. Syntax-based reordering as a preprocessing step has been applied to many language pairs other than English-Arabic. Most relevant to the approach in this paper are Collins et al. (2005) and Wang et al. (2007). Both parse the source side and then reorder the sentence based on predefined, linguistically motivated rules. Significant gain is reported for German-to-English and Chinese-to-English translation. Both suggest that reordering as a preprocessing step results in better alignment, and reduces the reliance on the distortion model. Popovic and Ney (2006) use similar methods to reorder German by looking at the POS tags for German-to-English and German-toSpanish. They show significant improvements on test set sentences that do get reordered as well as those that dont, which is attributed to the imp</context>

The table is also useful in recombining words that are erroneously segmented. If a certain word does not occur in the table, we back off to a set of manually defined recombination rules. Word ambiguity is resolved by picking the more frequent surface form. 4.2 Arabic Reordering Rules This section presents the syntax-based rules used for re-ordering the English source to better match the syntax of the Arabic target. These rules are motivated by the Arabic syntactic facts described in Section 2.2. Much like Wang et al. (2007), we parse the English side of our corpora and reorder using predefined rules. Reordering the English can be done more reliably than other source languages, such as Arabic, Chinese and German, since the stateof-the-art English parsers are considerably better than parsers of other languages. The following rules for reordering at the sentence level and the noun phrase level are applied to the English parse tree: 1. NP: All nouns, adjectives and adverbs in the noun phrase are inverted.

Significant gain is reported for German-to-English and Chinese-to-English translation. Both suggest that reordering as a preprocessing step results in better alignment, and reduces the reliance on the distortion model. Popovic and Ney (2006) use similar methods to reorder German by looking at the POS tags for German-to-English and German-toSpanish. They show significant improvements on test set sentences that do get reordered as well as those that dont, which is attributed to the improvement of the extracted phrases. (Xia and McCord, 2004) present a similar approach, with a notable difference: the re-ordering rules are automatically learned from aligning parse trees for both the source and target sentences. They report a 10% relative gain for English-to-French translation. Although target-side parsing is optional in this approach, it is needed to take full advantage of the approach. This is a bigger issue when no reliable parses are available for the target language, as is the case in this paper. More generally, the use of automatically-learned rules has the advantage of readily applicable to different language pairs. The use o</context>
