The challenges of Named Entities Recogni-
tion (NER) for tweets lie in the insufficient
information in a tweet and the unavailabil-
ity of training data. We propose to com-
bine a K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) classi-
fier with a linear Conditional Random Fields
(CRF) model under a semi-supervised learn-
ing framework to tackle these challenges. The
KNN based classifier conducts pre-labeling to
collect global coarse evidence across tweets
while the CRF model conducts sequential la-
beling to capture fine-grained information en-
coded in a tweet. The semi-supervised learn-
ing plus the gazetteers alleviate the lack of
training data. Extensive experiments show the
advantages of our method over the baselines
as well as the effectiveness of KNN and semi-
supervised learning.

1 Introduction
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.990445531914894">
Named Entities Recognition (NER) is generally un-
derstood as the task of identifying mentions of rigid
designators from text belonging to named-entity
types such as persons, organizations and locations
(Nadeau and Sekine, 2007). Proposed solutions to
NER fall into three categories: 1) The rule-based
(Krupka and Hausman, 1998); 2) the machine learn-
ing based (Finkel and Manning, 2009; Singh et al.,
2010) ; and 3) hybrid methods (Jansche and Abney,
2002). With the availability of annotated corpora,
such as ACE05, Enron (Minkov et al., 2005) and
This work has been done while the author was visiting
Microsoft Research Asia.
CoNLL03 (Tjong Kim Sang and De Meulder, 2003),
the data driven methods now become the dominating
methods.
However, current NER mainly focuses on for-
mal text such as news articles (Mccallum and Li,
2003; Etzioni et al., 2005). Exceptions include stud-
ies on informal text such as emails, blogs, clini-
cal notes (Wang, 2009). Because of the domain
mismatch, current systems trained on non-tweets
perform poorly on tweets, a new genre of text,
which are short, informal, ungrammatical and noise
prone. For example, the average F1 of the Stan-
ford NER (Finkel et al., 2005) , which is trained
on the CoNLL03 shared task data set and achieves
state-of-the-art performance on that task, drops from
90.8% (Ratinov and Roth, 2009) to 45.8% on tweets.
Thus, building a domain specific NER for tweets
is necessary, which requires a lot of annotated tweets
or rules. However, manually creating them is tedious
and prohibitively unaffordable. Proposed solutions
to alleviate this issue include: 1) Domain adaption,
which aims to reuse the knowledge of the source do-
main in a target domain. Two recent examples are
Wu et al. (2009), which uses data that is informa-
tive about the target domain and also easy to be la-
beled to bridge the two domains, and Chiticariu et
al. (2010), which introduces a high-level rule lan-
guage, called NERL, to build the general and do-
main specific NER systems; and 2) semi-supervised
learning, which aims to use the abundant unlabeled
data to compensate for the lack of annotated data.
Suzuki and Isozaki (2008) is one such example.
Another challenge is the limited information in
tweet. Two factors contribute to this difficulty. One

\x0cis the tweets informal nature, making conventional
features such as part-of-speech (POS) and capital-
ization not reliable. The performance of current
NLP tools drops sharply on tweets. For example,
OpenNLP 1, the state-of-the-art POS tagger, gets
only an accuracy of 74.0% on our test data set. The
other is the tweets short nature, leading to the ex-
cessive abbreviations or shorthand in tweets, and
the availability of very limited context information.
Tackling this challenge, ideally, requires adapting
related NLP tools to fit tweets, or normalizing tweets
to accommodate existing tools, both of which are
hard tasks.
We propose a novel NER system to address these
challenges. Firstly, a K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)
based classifier is adopted to conduct word level
classification, leveraging the similar and recently
labeled tweets. Following the two-stage predic-
tion aggregation methods (Krishnan and Manning,
2006), such pre-labeled results, together with other
conventional features used by the state-of-the-art
NER systems, are fed into a linear Conditional Ran-
dom Fields (CRF) (Lafferty et al., 2001) model,
which conducts fine-grained tweet level NER. Fur-
thermore, the KNN and CRF model are repeat-
edly retrained with an incrementally augmented
training set, into which high confidently labeled
tweets are added. Indeed, it is the combination of
KNN and CRF under a semi-supervised learning
framework that differentiates ours from the exist-
ing. Finally, following Lev Ratinov and Dan Roth
(2009), 30 gazetteers are used, which cover com-
mon names, countries, locations, temporal expres-
sions, etc. These gazetteers represent general knowl-
edge across domains. The underlying idea of our
method is to combine global evidence from KNN
and the gazetteers with local contextual information,
and to use common knowledge and unlabeled tweets
to make up for the lack of training data.
12,245 tweets are manually annotated as the test
data set. Experimental results show that our method
outperforms the baselines. It is also demonstrated
that integrating KNN classified results into the CRF
model and semi-supervised learning considerably
boost the performance.
Our contributions are summarized as follows.

\x0can entity, respectively) schema is applied. Other
methods, such as classification based on Maximum
Entropy models and sequential application of Per-
ceptron or Winnow (Collins, 2002), are also prac-
ticed. The state-of-the-art system, e.g., the Stanford
NER, can achieve an F1 score of over 92.0% on its
test set.
Biomedical NER represents another line of active
research. Machine learning based systems are com-
monly used and outperform the rule based systems.
A state-of-the-art biomedical NER system (Yoshida
and Tsujii, 2007) uses lexical features, orthographic
features, semantic features and syntactic features,
such as part-of-speech (POS) and shallow parsing.
A handful of work on other domains exists. For
example, Wang (2009) introduces NER on clinical
notes. A data set is manually annotated and a linear
CRF model is trained, which achieves an F-score of
81.48% on their test data set; Downey et al. (2007)
employ capitalization cues and n-gram statistics to
locate names of a variety of classes in web text;
most recently, Chiticariu et al. (2010) design and im-
plement a high-level language NERL that is tuned
to simplify the process of building, understanding,
and customizing complex rule-based named-entity
annotators for different domains.
Ratinov and Roth (2009) systematically study
the challenges in NER, compare several solutions
and report some interesting findings. For exam-
ple, they show that a conditional model that does
not consider interactions at the output level per-
forms comparably to beam search or Viterbi, and
that the BILOU (Beginning, the Inside and the Last
tokens of multi-token chunks as well as Unit-length
chunks) encoding scheme significantly outperforms
the BIO schema (Beginning, the Inside and Outside
of a chunk).
In contrast to the above work, our study focuses
on NER for tweets, a new genre of texts, which are
short, noise prone and ungrammatical.

2.3 Semi-supervised Learning for NER
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.9995019375">
Semi-supervised learning exploits both labeled and
un-labeled data. It proves useful when labeled data
is scarce and hard to construct while unlabeled data
is abundant and easy to access.
Bootstrapping is a typical semi-supervised learn-
ing method. It iteratively adds data that has been
confidently labeled but is also informative to its
training set, which is used to re-train its model. Jiang
and Zhai (2007) propose a balanced bootstrapping
algorithm and successfully apply it to NER. Their
method is based on instance re-weighting, which
allows the small amount of the bootstrapped train-
ing sets to have an equal weight to the large source
domain training set. Wu et al. (2009) propose an-
other bootstrapping algorithm that selects bridging
instances from an unlabeled target domain, which
are informative about the target domain and are also
easy to be correctly labeled. We adopt bootstrapping
as well, but use human labeled tweets as seeds.
Another representative of semi-supervised learn-
ing is learning a robust representation of the input
from unlabeled data. Miller et al. (2004) use word
clusters (Brown et al., 1992) learned from unla-
beled text, resulting in a performance improvement
of NER. Guo et al. (2009) introduce Latent Seman-
tic Association (LSA) for NER. In our pilot study of
NER for tweets, we adopt bag-of-words models to
represent a word in tweet, to concentrate our efforts
on combining global evidence with local informa-
tion and semi-supervised learning. We leave it to
our future work to explore which is the best input
representation for our task.

4 Our Method
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.9992205">
Now we present our solution to the challenging task
of NER for tweets. An overview of our method
is first given, followed by detailed discussion of its
core components.
</bodyText>
<subsectionHeader confidence="0.999538">
4.1 Method Overview
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999336">
NER task can be naturally divided into two sub-
tasks, i.e., boundary detection and type classifica-
tion. Following the common practice , we adopt
a sequential labeling approach to jointly resolve
these sub-tasks, i.e., for each word in the input
tweet, a label is assigned to it, indicating both the
boundary and entity type. Inspired by Ratinov and
Roth (2009), we use the BILOU schema.
Algorithm 1 outlines our method, where: trains
and traink denote two machine learning processes
to get the CRF labeler and the KNN classifier, re-
spectively; reprw converts a word in a tweet into a
bag-of-words vector; the reprt function transforms
a tweet into a feature matrix that is later fed into the
CRF model; the knn function predicts the class of
a word; the update function applies the predicted
class by KNN to the inputted tweet; the crf function
conducts word level NE labeling; and represent
the minimum labeling confidence of KNN and CRF,
respectively, which are experimentally set to 0.1 and
0.001; N (1,000 in our work) denotes the maximum
number of new accumulated training data.
Our method, as illustrated in Algorithm 1, repeat-
edly adds the new confidently labeled tweets to the
training set 4 and retrains itself once the number
of new accumulated training data goes above the
threshold N. Algorithm 1 also demonstrates one
striking characteristic of our method: A KNN clas-
sifier is applied to determine the label of the current
word before the CRF model. The labels of the words
that confidently assigned by the KNN classifier are
treated as visible variables for the CRF model.

<bodyText confidence="0.991276555555556">
Our model is hybrid in the sense that a KNN clas-
sifier and a CRF model are sequentially applied to
the target tweet, with the goal that the KNN classi-
fier captures global coarse evidence while the CRF
model fine-grained information encoded in a single
tweet and in the gazetteers. Algorithm 2 outlines the
training process of KNN, which records the labeled
word vector for every type of label.

for KNNs incapability to capture fine-grained evi-
dence involving multiple decision points.
The Linear CRF model is used as the fine model,
with the following considerations: 1) It is well-
studied and has been successfully used in state-of-
the-art NER systems (Finkel et al., 2005; Wang,
2009); 2) it can output the probability of a label
sequence, which can be used as the labeling con-
fidence that is necessary for the semi-supervised
learning framework.
In our experiments, the CRF++ 5 toolkit is used to
train a linear CRF model. We have written a Viterbi
decoder that can incorporate partially observed la-
bels to implement the crf function in Algorithm 1.

Given a word in a tweet, the KNN classifier consid-

word, our CRF model extracts similar features as
Wang (2009) and Ratinov and Roth (2009), namely,
orthographic features, lexical features and gazetteers
related features. In our work, we use the gazetteers
provided by Ratinov and Roth (2009).
Two points are worth noting here. One is that
before feature extraction for either the KNN or the
CRF, stop words are removed. The stop words
used here are mainly from a set of frequently-used

4.4 Discussion
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.996244076923077">
We now discuss several design considerations re-
lated to the performance of our method, i.e., addi-
tional features, gazetteers and alternative models.
Additional Features. Features related to chunking
and parsing are not adopted in our final system, be-
cause they give only a slight performance improve-
ment while a lot of computing resources are required
to extract such features. The ineffectiveness of these
features is linked to the noisy and informal nature of
tweets. Word class (Brown et al., 1992) features are
not used either, which prove to be unhelpful for our
system. We are interested in exploring other tweet
representations, which may fit our NER task, for ex-
ample the LSA models (Guo et al., 2009).
Gazetteers. In our work, gazetteers prove to be sub-
stantially useful, which is consistent with the obser-
vation of Ratinov and Roth (2009). However, the
gazetteers used in our work contain noise, which
hurts the performance. Moreover, they are static,
directly from Ratinov and Roth (2009), thus with
a relatively lower coverage, especially for person
names and product names in tweets. We are devel-
oping tools to clean the gazetteers. In future, we plan
to feed the fresh entities correctly identified from
tweets back into the gazetteers. The correctness of
an entity can rely on its frequency or other evidence.
Alternative Models. We have replaced KNN by
other classifiers, such as those based on Maximum
Entropy and Support Vector Machines, respectively.
KNN consistently yields comparable performance,
while enjoying a faster retraining speed. Similarly,
to study the effectiveness of the CRF model, it is re-
placed by its alternations, such as the HMM labeler
and a beam search plus a maximum entropy based
classifier. In contrast to what is reported by Ratinov
and Roth (2009), it turns out that the CRF model
gives remarkably better results than its competitors.
Note that all these evaluations are on the same train-
ing and testing data sets as described in Section 5.1.

Here TYPE is PERSON, PRODUCT, ORGANIZA-
TION or LOCATION. 3555 tweets are dropped be-
cause of inconsistent annotation. Finally we get
12,245 tweets, forming the gold-standard data set.
Figure 1 shows the portion of named entities of dif-
ferent types. On average, a named entity has 1.2
words. The gold-standard data set is evenly split into
two parts: One for training and the other for testing.

<bodyText confidence="0.998788083333333">
For every type of named entity, Precision (Pre.), re-
call (Rec.) and F1 are used as the evaluation met-
rics. Precision is a measure of what percentage the
output labels are correct, and recall tells us to what
percentage the labels in the gold-standard data set
are correctly labeled, while F1 is the harmonic mean
of precision and recall. For the overall performance,
we use the average Precision, Recall and F1, where
the weight of each name entity type is proportional
to the number of entities of that type. These metrics
are widely used by existing NER systems to evaluate
their performance.

Errors made by our system on the test set fall into
three categories. The first kind of error, accounting
for 35.5% of all errors, is largely related to slang ex-
pressions and informal abbreviations. For example,
our method identifies Cali, which actually means
California, as a PERSON in the tweet i love Cali

component to handle such slang expressions and in-
formal abbreviations.
The second kind of error, accounting for 37.2%
of all errors, is mainly attributed to the data sparse-
ness. For example, for this tweet come to see jaxon
someday, our method mistakenly labels jaxon
as a LOCATION, which actually denotes a PER-
SON. This error is understandable somehow, since
this tweet is one of the earliest tweets that mention
jaxon, and at that time there was no strong evi-
dence supporting that it represents a person. Possi-
ble solutions to these errors include continually en-
riching the gazetteers and aggregating additional ex-
ternal knowledge from other channels such as tradi-
tional news.
The last kind of error, which represents 27.3%
of all errors, somehow links to the noise prone na-
ture of tweets. Consider this tweet wesley snipes
ws cought 4 nt payin tax coz ths celebz dnt take it
cirus., in which wesley snipes is not identified
as a PERSON but simply ignored by our method,
because this tweet is too noisy to provide effective
features. Tweet normalization technology seems a
possible solution to alleviate this kind of error.

6 Conclusions and Future work
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.9994215">
We propose a novel NER system for tweets, which
combines a KNN classifier with a CRF labeler under
a semi-supervised learning framework. The KNN
classifier collects global information across recently
labeled tweets while the CRF labeler exploits infor-
mation from a single tweet and from the gazetteers.
A serials of experiments show the effectiveness of
our method, and particularly, show the positive ef-
fects of KNN and semi-supervised learning.
In future, we plan to further improve the per-
formance of our method through two directions.
Firstly, we hope to develop tweet normalization
technology to make tweets friendlier to the NER
task. Secondly, we are interested in integrating
new entities from tweets or other channels into the
gazetteers.

<abstract confidence="0.997327263157895">The challenges of Named Entities Recognition (NER) for tweets lie in the insufficient information in a tweet and the unavailability of training data. We propose to combine a K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) classifier with a linear Conditional Random Fields (CRF) model under a semi-supervised learning framework to tackle these challenges. The KNN based classifier conducts pre-labeling to collect global coarse evidence across tweets while the CRF model conducts sequential labeling to capture fine-grained information encoded in a tweet. The semi-supervised learning plus the gazetteers alleviate the lack of training data. Extensive experiments show the advantages of our method over the baselines as well as the effectiveness of KNN and semisupervised learning.</abstract>

Wu et al. (2009) propose another bootstrapping algorithm that selects bridging instances from an unlabeled target domain, which are informative about the target domain and are also easy to be correctly labeled. We adopt bootstrapping as well, but use human labeled tweets as seeds. Another representative of semi-supervised learning is learning a robust representation of the input from unlabeled data. Miller et al. (2004) use word clusters (Brown et al., 1992) learned from unlabeled text, resulting in a performance improvement of NER. Guo et al. (2009) introduce Latent Semantic Association (LSA) for NER. In our pilot study of NER for tweets, we adopt bag-of-words models to represent a word in tweet, to concentrate our efforts on combining global evidence with local information and semi-supervised learning. We leave it to our future work to explore which is the best input representation for our task. 3 Task Definition We first introduce some background about tweets, then give a formal definition of the task. 3.1 The Tweets A tweet is a short text me</context>

Hash tags are treated as common words. 4.4 Discussion We now discuss several design considerations related to the performance of our method, i.e., additional features, gazetteers and alternative models. Additional Features. Features related to chunking and parsing are not adopted in our final system, because they give only a slight performance improvement while a lot of computing resources are required to extract such features. The ineffectiveness of these features is linked to the noisy and informal nature of tweets. Word class (Brown et al., 1992) features are not used either, which prove to be unhelpful for our system. We are interested in exploring other tweet representations, which may fit our NER task, for example the LSA models (Guo et al., 2009). Gazetteers. In our work, gazetteers prove to be substantially useful, which is consistent with the observation of Ratinov and Roth (2009). However, the gazetteers used in our work contain noise, which hurts the performance. Moreover, they are static, directly from Ratinov and Roth (2009), thus with a relatively lower coverage, especially for person names and product names in tweets. We a</context>

Thus, building a domain specific NER for tweets is necessary, which requires a lot of annotated tweets or rules. However, manually creating them is tedious and prohibitively unaffordable. Proposed solutions to alleviate this issue include: 1) Domain adaption, which aims to reuse the knowledge of the source domain in a target domain. Two recent examples are Wu et al. (2009), which uses data that is informative about the target domain and also easy to be labeled to bridge the two domains, and Chiticariu et al. (2010), which introduces a high-level rule language, called NERL, to build the general and domain specific NER systems; and 2) semi-supervised learning, which aims to use the abundant unlabeled data to compensate for the lack of annotated data. Suzuki and Isozaki (2008) is one such example. Another challenge is the limited information in tweet. Two factors contribute to this difficulty. One 359 \x0cis the tweets informal nature, making conventional features such as part-of-speech (POS) and capitalization not reliable. The performance of current NLP tools drops sharply on tweets. For example, OpenNLP</context>

A state-of-the-art biomedical NER system (Yoshida and Tsujii, 2007) uses lexical features, orthographic features, semantic features and syntactic features, such as part-of-speech (POS) and shallow parsing. A handful of work on other domains exists. For example, Wang (2009) introduces NER on clinical notes. A data set is manually annotated and a linear CRF model is trained, which achieves an F-score of 81.48% on their test data set; Downey et al. (2007) employ capitalization cues and n-gram statistics to locate names of a variety of classes in web text; most recently, Chiticariu et al. (2010) design and implement a high-level language NERL that is tuned to simplify the process of building, understanding, and customizing complex rule-based named-entity annotators for different domains. Ratinov and Roth (2009) systematically study the challenges in NER, compare several solutions and report some interesting findings. For example, they show that a conditional model that does not consider interactions at the output level performs comparably to beam search or Viterbi, and that the BILOU (Beginning, the Inside and the Last tokens of multi-token chunks as well as Unit-length chunks) encod</context>

Machine learning based systems are commonly used and outperform the rule based systems. A state-of-the-art biomedical NER system (Yoshida and Tsujii, 2007) uses lexical features, orthographic features, semantic features and syntactic features, such as part-of-speech (POS) and shallow parsing. A handful of work on other domains exists. For example, Wang (2009) introduces NER on clinical notes. A data set is manually annotated and a linear CRF model is trained, which achieves an F-score of 81.48% on their test data set; Downey et al. (2007) employ capitalization cues and n-gram statistics to locate names of a variety of classes in web text; most recently, Chiticariu et al. (2010) design and implement a high-level language NERL that is tuned to simplify the process of building, understanding, and customizing complex rule-based named-entity annotators for different domains. Ratinov and Roth (2009) systematically study the challenges in NER, compare several solutions and report some interesting findings. For example, they show that a conditional model that does not consider interactions at the output level performs comparably to be</context>

The Linear CRF model is used as the fine model, with the following considerations: 1) It is wellstudied and has been successfully used in state-ofthe-art NER systems (Finkel et al., 2005; Wang, 2009); 2) it can output the probability of a label sequence, which can be used as the labeling confidence that is necessary for the semi-supervised learning framework. In our experiments, the CRF++ 5 toolkit is used to train a linear CRF model. We have written a Viterbi decoder that can incorporate partially observed labels to implement the crf function in Algorithm 1. 4.3 Features Given a word in a tweet, the KNN classifier considers a text window of size 5 with the word in the middle (Zhang and Johnson, 2003), and extracts bag-ofword features from the window as features.

We adopt bootstrapping as well, but use human labeled tweets as seeds. Another representative of semi-supervised learning is learning a robust representation of the input from unlabeled data. Miller et al. (2004) use word clusters (Brown et al., 1992) learned from unlabeled text, resulting in a performance improvement of NER. Guo et al. (2009) introduce Latent Semantic Association (LSA) for NER. In our pilot study of NER for tweets, we adopt bag-of-words models to represent a word in tweet, to concentrate our efforts on combining global evidence with local information and semi-supervised learning. We leave it to our future work to explore which is the best input representation for our task. 3 Task Definition We first introduce some background about tweets, then give a formal definition of the task. 3.1 The Tweets A tweet is a short text message containing no more than 140 characters in Twitter, the biggest micro-blog service.

Features related to chunking and parsing are not adopted in our final system, because they give only a slight performance improvement while a lot of computing resources are required to extract such features. The ineffectiveness of these features is linked to the noisy and informal nature of tweets. Word class (Brown et al., 1992) features are not used either, which prove to be unhelpful for our system. We are interested in exploring other tweet representations, which may fit our NER task, for example the LSA models (Guo et al., 2009). Gazetteers. In our work, gazetteers prove to be substantially useful, which is consistent with the observation of Ratinov and Roth (2009). However, the gazetteers used in our work contain noise, which hurts the performance. Moreover, they are static, directly from Ratinov and Roth (2009), thus with a relatively lower coverage, especially for person names and product names in tweets. We are developing tools to clean the gazetteers. In future, we plan to feed the fresh entities correctly identified from tweets back into the gazetteers.

In contrast to the above work, our study focuses on NER for tweets, a new genre of texts, which are short, noise prone and ungrammatical. 2.3 Semi-supervised Learning for NER Semi-supervised learning exploits both labeled and un-labeled data. It proves useful when labeled data is scarce and hard to construct while unlabeled data is abundant and easy to access. Bootstrapping is a typical semi-supervised learning method. It iteratively adds data that has been confidently labeled but is also informative to its training set, which is used to re-train its model. Jiang and Zhai (2007) propose a balanced bootstrapping algorithm and successfully apply it to NER. Their method is based on instance re-weighting, which allows the small amount of the bootstrapped training sets to have an equal weight to the large source domain training set. Wu et al. (2009) propose another bootstrapping algorithm that selects bridging instances from an unlabeled target domain, which are informative about the target domain and are also easy to be correctly labeled.

The other is the tweets short nature, leading to the excessive abbreviations or shorthand in tweets, and the availability of very limited context information. Tackling this challenge, ideally, requires adapting related NLP tools to fit tweets, or normalizing tweets to accommodate existing tools, both of which are hard tasks. We propose a novel NER system to address these challenges. Firstly, a K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) based classifier is adopted to conduct word level classification, leveraging the similar and recently labeled tweets. Following the two-stage prediction aggregation methods (Krishnan and Manning, 2006), such pre-labeled results, together with other conventional features used by the state-of-the-art NER systems, are fed into a linear Conditional Random Fields (CRF) (Lafferty et al., 2001) model, which conducts fine-grained tweet level NER. Furthermore, the KNN and CRF model are repeatedly retrained with an incrementally augmented training set, into which high confidently labeled tweets are added. Indeed, it is the combination of KNN and CRF under a semi-supervised learning framework that differentiates ours from the existing.

(2009) propose another bootstrapping algorithm that selects bridging instances from an unlabeled target domain, which are informative about the target domain and are also easy to be correctly labeled. We adopt bootstrapping as well, but use human labeled tweets as seeds. Another representative of semi-supervised learning is learning a robust representation of the input from unlabeled data.

In our pilot study of NER for tweets, we adopt bag-of-words models to represent a word in tweet, to concentrate our efforts on combining global evidence with local information and semi-supervised learning. We leave it to our future work to explore which is the best input representation for our task. 3 Task Definition We first introduce some background about tweets, then give a formal definition of the task. 3.</context>

Proposed solutions to alleviate this issue include: 1) Domain adaption, which aims to reuse the knowledge of the source domain in a target domain. Two recent examples are Wu et al. (2009), which uses data that is informative about the target domain and also easy to be labeled to bridge the two domains, and Chiticariu et al. (2010), which introduces a high-level rule language, called NERL,</context>

For example, Wang (2009) introduces NER on clinical notes. A data set is manually annotated and a linear CRF model is trained, which achieves an F-score of 81.48% on their test data set; Downey et al. (2007) employ capitalization cues and n-gram statistics to locate names of a variety of classes in web text; most recently, Chiticariu et al.

Ratinov and Roth (2009) systematically study the challenges in NER, compare several solutions and report some interesting findings. For example, they show that a conditional model that does not consider interactions at the output level performs comparably to beam search or Viterbi, and that the BILOU (Beginning, the Inside and the Last tokens of multi-token chunks as well as Unit-length chunks) encoding scheme significantly outperforms the BIO schema (Beginning, the Inside and Outside of a chunk). In contrast to the above work, our study focuses on NER for tweets, a new genre of texts, which are short, noise prone a</context>

An overview of our method is first given, followed by detailed discussion of its core components. 4.1 Method Overview NER task can be naturally divided into two subtasks, i.e., boundary detection and type classification. Following the common practice , we adopt a sequential labeling approach to jointly resolve these sub-tasks, i.e., for each word in the input tweet, a label is assigned to it, indicating both the boundary and entity type. Inspired by Ratinov and Roth (2009), we use the BILOU schema. Algorithm 1 outlines our method, where: trains and traink denote two machine learning processes to get the CRF labeler and the KNN classifier, respectively; reprw converts a word in a tweet into a bag-of-words vector; the reprt function transforms a tweet into a feature matrix that is later fed into the CRF model; the knn function predicts the class of a word; the update function applies the predicted class by KNN to the inputted tweet; the crf function conducts word level NE labeling; and represent the minimum labeling confidence of KNN and CRF, respectively, which </context>
<context position="18720" citStr="Ratinov and Roth (2009)" startWordPosition="3090" endWordPosition="3093">uence, which can be used as the labeling confidence that is necessary for the semi-supervised learning framework. In our experiments, the CRF++ 5 toolkit is used to train a linear CRF model. We have written a Viterbi decoder that can incorporate partially observed labels to implement the crf function in Algorithm 1. 4.3 Features Given a word in a tweet, the KNN classifier considers a text window of size 5 with the word in the middle (Zhang and Johnson, 2003), and extracts bag-ofword features from the window as features. For each word, our CRF model extracts similar features as Wang (2009) and Ratinov and Roth (2009), namely, orthographic features, lexical features and gazetteers related features. In our work, we use the gazetteers provided by Ratinov and Roth (2009). Two points are worth noting here. One is that before feature extraction for either the KNN or the CRF, stop words are removed. The stop words used here are mainly from a set of frequently-used words 6. The other is that tweet meta data is normalized, that is, every link becomes *LINK* and every 5 http://crfpp.sourceforge.net/ 6 http://www.textfixer.com/resources/common-englishwords.txt 363 \x0caccount name becomes *ACCOUNT*. Hash tags are tr</context>

The ineffectiveness of these features is linked to the noisy and informal nature of tweets. Word class (Brown et al., 1992) features are not used either, which prove to be unhelpful for our system. We are interested in exploring other tweet representations, which may fit our NER task, for example the LSA models (Guo et al., 2009). Gazetteers. In our work, gazetteers prove to be substantially useful, which is consistent with the observation of Ratinov and Roth (2009). However, the gazetteers used in our work contain noise, which hurts the performance. Moreover, they are static, directly from Ratinov and Roth (2009), thus with a relatively lower coverage, especially for person names and product names in tweets. We are developing tools to clean the gazetteers. In future, we plan to feed the fresh entities correctly identified from tweets back into the gazetteers. The correctness of an entity can rely on its frequency or other evidence. Alternative Models. We have replaced KNN by other classifiers, such as those based on Maximum Entropy and Support Vector Ma</context>

As is opposite to the finding of Ratinov and Roth (2009), the CRF model gives remarkably better results, i.e., 2.1% higher in F1 than its best followers (with p &lt; 0.001). Table 7 shows the overall performance of the CRF labeler with various feature set combinations, where Fo, Fl and Fg denote the orthographic features, the lexical features and the gazetteers related features, respectively. It can be seen from Table 7 that the lexical and gazetteer related features are helpful. Other advanced features such as chunking are also explored but with no significant improvement. 5.7 Effects of Semi-supervised Learning Table 8 compares our method with its m</context>

In our experiments, the CRF++ 5 toolkit is used to train a linear CRF model. We have written a Viterbi decoder that can incorporate partially observed labels to implement the crf function in Algorithm 1. 4.3 Features Given a word in a tweet, the KNN classifier considers a text window of size 5 with the word in the middle (Zhang and Johnson, 2003), and extracts bag-ofword features from the window as features. For each word, our CRF model extracts similar features as Wang (2009) and Ratinov and Roth (2009), namely, orthographic features, lexical features and gazetteers related features. In our work, we use the gazetteers provided by Ratinov and Roth (2009). Two points are worth noting here. One is that before feature extraction for either the KNN or the CRF, stop words are removed. The stop words used here are mainly from a set of frequently-used words 6. The other is that tweet meta data is normalized, that is, every link becomes *LINK</context>
