For example, the average F1 of the Stanford NER CITATION , which is trained on the CoNLL03 shared task data set and achieves state-of-the-art performance on that task, drops from 90.8% CITATION to 45.8% on tweets,,
For example, CITATION use manual rules to extract entities of predefined types; Zhou and Ju (2002) adopt Hidden Markov Models (HMM) while CITATION use CRF to train a sequential NE labeler, in which the BIO (meaning Beginning, the Inside and the Outside of 2 https://www.mturk.com/mturk/ 3 http://crowdflower.com/ 360 \x0can entity, respectively) schema is applied,,
Other methods, such as classification based on Maximum Entropy models and sequential application of Perceptron or Winnow CITATION, are also practiced,,
However, current NER mainly focuses on formal text such as news articles (CITATION; CITATION),,
The Linear CRF model is used as the fine model, with the following considerations: 1) It is wellstudied and has been successfully used in state-ofthe-art NER systems (CITATION; CITATION); 2) it can output the probability of a label sequence, which can be used as the labeling confidence that is necessary for the semi-supervised learning framework,,
Two recent examples are CITATION, which uses data that is informative about the tar,,
4.3 Features Given a word in a tweet, the KNN classifier considers a text window of size 5 with the word in the middle CITATION, and extracts bag-ofword features from the window as features,,
Exceptions include studies on informal text such as emails, blogs, clinical notes CITATION,,
