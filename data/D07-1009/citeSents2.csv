This measure was first introduced in the context of sentence ordering by CITATION,,
4 Features Features used in our experiments are inspired by previous work on corpus-based approaches for discourse analysis (CITATION; CITATION; CITATION),,
In fact, when the perceptron update rule of CITATION which modifies the weights of every divergent node along the predicted and true paths is used in the ranking framework, it becomes virtually identical with the standard, flat, ranking perceptron of CITATION.5 In contrast, our approach shares the idea of (CITATIONa) that if a parent class has been predicted wrongly, then errors in the children should not be taken into account,,
parser CITATION,,
The degree of variability observed in this experiment is consistent with human performance on other text structuring tasks such as sentence ordering (CITATION; CITATION),,
2 Related Work Text Structuring The insertion task is closely related to the extensively studied problem of sentence ordering.3 Most of the existing algorithms represent text structure as a linear sequence and are driven by local coherence constraints (CITATION; CITATION; CITATION; Barzilay and CITATION; CITATION; CITATION),,
The model weights are trained using the standard ranking perceptron CITATION,,
To make sentencelevel insertion decisions, we use a local model in line with previous sentence-ordering work (CITATION; CITATION),,
To eliminate spam, we place constraints on inserted sentences: (1) a sentence has at least 8 tokens and at most 120 tokens; (2) the MINIPAR parser CITATION can identify a subject or an object in a sentence,,
Relative to other corpora used in text structuring research (CITATION; CITATION; CITATION), texts in 6 Insertion is only one type of recorded update, others include deletions and sentence rewriting,,
Given a hierarchically structured text composed of sections and paragraphs, the sentence insertion model determines the best paragraph within 5 The main remaining difference is that CITATION use a passive-aggressive update rule CITATION and in doing so enforce a margin based on tree distance,,
We also view this as one of the key ideas of the incremental perceptron algorithm of CITATION, which searches through a complex decision space step-by-step and is immediately updated at the first wrong move,,
To identify the exact location of the sentence within the chosen paragraph, local ordering methods such as CITATION could be used,,
