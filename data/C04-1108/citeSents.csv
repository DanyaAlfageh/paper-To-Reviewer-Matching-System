We consider topical segmentation and chronological ordering to be fundamental to sentence ordering as well as conventional ordering techniques CITATION and make an attempt to refine the ordering,,
Lapata CITATION proposes another approach to information ordering based on a probabilistic model that assumes the probability of any given sentence is determined by its adjacent sentence and learns constraints on sentence order from a corpus of domain specific texts,,
After measuring distance or dissimilarity between two articles #x and #y: distance(Dx, Dy) = 1 Dx Dy |Dx||Dy| , (1) we apply the nearest neighbor method CITATION to merge a pair of clusters when their minimum distance is lower than a given parameter = 0.3 (determined empirically),,
Although it is convenient that we can obtain a great number of documents with a search engine, this situation also presents the information pollution problem: Who is willing to take the tedious burden of reading all those text documents? Automatic text summarization CITATION, is one solution to the problem, providing users with a condensed version of the original text,,
Although there has been a great deal of research on extraction since the early stage of natural language processing CITATION, research on post-processing of automatic summarization is relatively small in number,,
Discourse coherence as typified by rhetorical relation CITATION and coherence relation CITATION is of help to this question,,
CITATION address the problem of sentence ordering in the context of multi-document summarization and the impact of sentence ordering on readability of a summary,,
Because a method for multi-document summarization (e.g., MMR CITATION) makes effort to acquire information coverage and refuse redundant information at the same time, it is quite natural that the method does not choose both sentence c and c in terms of redundancy and prefers sentence c as c in terms of information coverage,,
Although resolving temporal expressions in sentences (e.g., yesterday, the next year, etc.) (CITATION; CITATION) may give a more precise estimation of these relations, it is not an easy task,,
