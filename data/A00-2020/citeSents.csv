The method used in this paper is based on a method for anomaly detection which detects anomalies in noisy data CITATION,,1
The log likelihood for our case is: LL(D) = IMI log(1 - A) + ~[] log(PM(xi)) xiEM +lAIlogA + ~ log(PA(xj)) (3) xj EA \x0cIn order to determine which elements are anomalies, we use a general principal for determining outliers in multivariate data CITATION,,0
