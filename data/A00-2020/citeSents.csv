We use a &quot;mixture model&quot; for explaining the presence of anomalies, one of several popular models in statistics for explaining outliers CITATION,,
Adwait CITATION estimates a probability distribution for tagging using a maximum entropy approach,,
This includes transformation-based tagging (CITATION; CITATION),,
We evaluate this method over the part of speech tagged portion of the Penn Treebank corpus CITATION,,

The sparse Markov transducer probability modeling method is an extension of adaptive mixtures of probabilistic transducers (CITATION; CITATION),,
The sparse Markov transducer probability modeling method is an extension of adaptive mixtures of probabilistic transducers (CITATION; Pereira and S,,
The method used in this paper is based on a method for anomaly detection which detects anomalies in noisy data CITATION,,
The log likelihood for our case is: LL(D) = IMI log(1 - A) + ~[] log(PM(xi)) xiEM +lAIlogA + ~ log(PA(xj)) (3) xj EA \x0cIn order to determine which elements are anomalies, we use a general principal for determining outliers in multivariate data CITATION,,
Regarding error detection in corpora, CITATION discusses inconsistencies in the Penn Treebank and relates them to interannotator differences in tagging style,,

Typically anomaly detection methods are applied to detect attacks by comparing the activity during an attack to the activity under normal use (CITATION; CITATION),,
