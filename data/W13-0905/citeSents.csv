The algorithm is described in two implementations (or pipelines) corresponding, respectively, to the use of WN and VerbNet (CITATION; CITATION) as semantic knowledge-bases, and to their replacement by our automatically recomputed form of WN, which enables predictions about the preference behavior (see below) of English verbs and adjectives to be better founded than in VerbNet (VN) and on a much larger scale,,
2 Background on Metaphor Detection using Preference Violation as Cue In early work on metaphor detection, long preceding access to large-scale or annotated corpora, it was suggested as sufficient a criterion for being a metaphor that a semantic preference of a verb or adjective was violated CITATION,,

But many are simply part of the history of the language, and are novel only to those who do not happen to know them already: for example Tom is a brick taken to mean that he is a reliable man, but which cannot be literally true is actually encoded as a sense of brick in WordNet (WN) CITATION even though it is more familiar to UK than US English speakers,,
