to other NLP problems (CITATION; Toutanova et al., 2008; CITATION; CITATION; CITATION; CITATION),,
CITATION apply a similar approach by aggregating local classification decisions using tempo880 \x0cral constraints (e.g., mutual exclusion, containment, and succession) and joint inference,,
We use the Stanford Core NLP suite (CITATION; CITATION; CITATION; CITATION) to annotate each document with POS and NER tags, parse trees, and coreference chains,,
The search process assumes that if a fluents entity and slot value co-occur in a sentence,5 that sentence is typically a positive example of the fluent.6 This is sometimes known as distant supervision (CITATION; CITATION),,
Other questions can be asked at the fluent level rather than the boundary level CITATION,,
The CUNY and UNED systems (CITATION; CITATION) for this task used classifiers to determine the relation between temporal expressions and fluents,,
Much of this work uses the Allen interval relations CITATION which richly describe partial orderings of fluents,,
CITATION which uses label propagation, a graphbased semi-supervised method to extend positive and negative seed examples over the graph,,
y of related work that focuses on ordering events or classifying temporal relations between them (CITATION; CITATION; CITATION; CITATION, inter alia),,
Two recent examples in information extraction include using Markov Logic for temporal ordering CITATION and using dualdecomposition for event extraction CITATION,,
Other participants used rule-based and pattern matching approaches (CITATION; CITATION; CITATION),,

4.2 Baselines and oracle The simplest baseline is the null baseline, proposed in CITATION,,
We use both the original depen875 \x0cdency paths and their collapsed Stanford Dependencies forms (de Marneffe and CITATION),,
This can be seen in the temporal slot filling track in the TAC-KBP 2011 shared task CITATION,,
Features for the classifier include many of those in CITATION,,

For example, CITATION uses the HOLDS metarelation,,
On top of this, we apply a rule-based temporal expression extractor CITATION,,
4.1 Evaluation metric Our evaluation metric is adapted from the Temporal KBP metric CITATION to work with 2-tuples for temporal representations rather than the 4-tuples in Temporal KBP,,
The first baseline, basic aggregation, is along the same lines as the aggregation method used in CITATION, a state-ofthe-art system,,
