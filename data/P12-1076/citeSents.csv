Since two entities mentioned in a sentence do not always have a relation, we select entity pairs from a corpus when: (i) the path of the dependency parse tree between the corresponding two named entities in the sentence is no longer than 4 and (ii) the path does not contain a sentence-like boundary, such as a relative clause1 (CITATION; CITATION),,

We compared the following methods: logistic regression with the labeled data cleaned by the proposed method (PROP), logistic regression with the standard DS labeled data (LR), and MultiR proposed in CITATION as a state-of-the-art multiinstance learning system.7 For logistic regression, when more than one relation is assigned to a sentence, we simply copied the feature vector and created a training example for each relation,,
Ideally, the parameters such as a threshold for scoring function should be determined for each relation, but there are no principled methods CITATION,,
