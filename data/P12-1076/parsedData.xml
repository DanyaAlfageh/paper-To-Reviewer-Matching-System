In relation extraction, distant supervision
seeks to extract relations between entities
from text by using a knowledge base, such as
Freebase, as a source of supervision. When
a sentence and a knowledge base refer to the
same entity pair, this approach heuristically la-
bels the sentence with the corresponding re-
lation in the knowledge base. However, this
heuristic can fail with the result that some sen-
tences are labeled wrongly. This noisy labeled
data causes poor extraction performance. In
this paper, we propose a method to reduce
the number of wrong labels. We present a
novel generative model that directly models
the heuristic labeling process of distant super-
vision. The model predicts whether assigned
labels are correct or wrong via its hidden vari-
ables. Our experimental results show that this
model detected wrong labels with higher per-
formance than baseline methods. In the ex-
periment, we also found that our wrong label
reduction boosted the performance of relation
extraction.

Machine learning approaches have been developed
to address relation extraction, which is the task of
extracting semantic relations between entities ex-
pressed in text. Supervised approaches are limited in
scalability because labeled data is expensive to pro-
duce. A particularly attractive approach, called dis-
tant supervision (DS), creates labeled data by heuris-
tically aligning entities in text with those in a knowl-
edge base, such as Freebase (Mintz et al., 2009).

per sentence: correct labeling; lower sentence: incorrect
labeling.
With DS it is assumed that if a sentence contains
an entity pair in a knowledge base, such a sentence
actually expresses the corresponding relation in the
knowledge base.
However, the DS assumption can fail, which re-
sults in noisy labeled data and this causes poor ex-
traction performance. An entity pair in a target text
generally expresses more than one relation while
a knowledge base stores a subset of the relations.
The assumption ignores this possibility. For in-
stance, consider the place of birth relation between
Michael Jackson and Gary in Figure 1. The upper
sentence indeed expresses the place of birth relation
between the two entities. In DS place of birth is as-
signed to the sentence, and it becomes a useful train-
ing example. On the other hand, the lower sentence
does not express this relation between the two enti-
ties, but the DS heuristic wrongly labels the sentence
as expressing it.
Riedel et al. (2010) relax the DS assumption as
at least one sentence containing an entity pair ex-

\x0cpressing the corresponding relation in the knowl-
edge base. They cast the relaxed assumption as
multi-instance learning. However, even the relaxed
assumption can fail. The relaxation is equivalent to
the DS assumption when a labeled pair of entities
is mentioned once in a target corpus (Riedel et al.,
2010). In fact, 91.7% of entity pairs appear only
once in Wikipedia articles (see Section 7).
In this paper, we propose a method to reduce the
number of wrong labels generated by DS without
using either of these assumptions. Given the labeled
corpus created with the DS assumption, we first pre-
dict whether each pattern, which frequently appears
in text to express a relation (see Section 4), expresses
a target relation. Patterns that are predicted not to ex-
press the relation are used to form a negative pattern
list for removing wrong labels of the relation.
The main contributions of this paper are as fol-
lows:
To make the pattern prediction, we propose a
generative model that directly models the pro-
cess of automatic labeling in DS. Without any
strong assumptions like Riedel et al. (2010)s,
the model predicts whether each pattern ex-
presses each relation via hidden variables (see
Section 5).
Our variational inference for our generative
model lets us automatically calibrate parame-
ters for each relation, which are sensitive to the
performance (see Section 6).
We applied our method to Wikipedia articles
using Freebase as a knowledge base and found
that (i) our model identified patterns express-
ing a given relation more accurately than base-
line methods and (ii) our method led to bet-
ter extraction performance than the original DS
(Mintz et al., 2009) and MultiR (Hoffmann et
al., 2011), which is a state-of-the-art multi-
instance learning system for relation extraction
(see Section 7).

The increasingly popular approach, called distant
supervision (DS), or weak supervision, utilizes a
knowledge base to heuristically label a corpus (Wu
and Weld, 2007; Bellare and McCallum, 2007; Pal
et al., 2007). Our work was inspired by Mintz et al.
(2009) who used Freebase as a knowledge base by
making the DS assumption and trained relation ex-
tractors on Wikipedia. Previous works (Hoffmann
et al., 2010; Yao et al., 2010) have pointed out that
the DS assumption generates noisy labeled data, but
did not directly address the problem. Wang et al.
(2011) applied a rule-based method to the problem
by using popular entity types and keywords for each
relation. In (Bellare and McCallum, 2007; Riedel et
al., 2010; Hoffmann et al., 2011), they used multi-
instance learning, which deals with uncertainty of
labels, to relax the DS assumption. However, the re-
laxed assumption can fail when a labeled entity pair
is mentioned only once in a corpus (Riedel et al.,
2010). Our approach relies on neither of these as-
sumptions.
Bootstrapping for relation extraction (Riloff and
Jones, 1999; Pantel and Pennacchiotti, 2006; Carl-
son et al., 2010) is related to our method. In boot-
strapping, seed entity pairs of the target relation are
given in order to select reliable patterns, which are
used to extract new entity pairs. To avoid the selec-
tion of unreliable patterns, bootstrapping introduces
scoring functions for each pattern candidate. This
can be applied to our approach, which seeks to re-
duce the number of unreliable patterns by using a set
of given entity pairs. However, the bootstrapping-
like approach suffers from sensitive parameters that
are critical to its performance. Ideally, the parame-
ters such as a threshold for scoring function should
be determined for each relation, but there are no
principled methods (Komachi et al., 2008). In our
approach, parameters are calibrated for each rela-
tion by maximizing the likelihood of our generative
model.

In this section, we describe DS for relation extrac-
tion. We use the term relation as the relation be-
tween two entities. A relation instance is a tuple
consisting of two entities and relation r. For exam-
ple, place of birth(Michael Jackson, Gary) in Fig-
ure 1 is a relation instance.
Relation extraction seeks to extract relation in-
stances from text. An entity is mentioned as a named
entity in text. We extract a relation instance from a

\x0csingle sentence. For example, from the upper sen-
tence in Figure 1 we extract place of birth(Michael
Jackson, Gary). Since two entities mentioned in a
sentence do not always have a relation, we select en-
tity pairs from a corpus when: (i) the path of the de-
pendency parse tree between the corresponding two
named entities in the sentence is no longer than 4
and (ii) the path does not contain a sentence-like
boundary, such as a relative clause1 (Banko et al.,
2007; Banko and Etzioni, 2008). Banko and Et-
zioni (2008) found that a set of eight lexico-syntactic
forms covers nearly 95% of relation phrases in their
corpus. (Fader et al. (2011) found that this set covers
69% of their corpus). Our rule is designed to cover
at least the eight lexico-syntactic forms. We use the
entity pairs extracted by this rule.
DS uses a knowledge base to create labeled data
for relation extraction by heuristically matching en-
tity pairs. A knowledge base is a set of relation
instances about predefined relations. For each sen-
tence in the corpus, we extract all of its entity pairs.
Then, for each entity pair, we try to retrieve the rela-
tion instances about the entity pair from the knowl-
edge base. If we found such a relation instance, then
the set of its relation, the entity pair, and the sentence
is stored as a positive example. If not, then the set of
the entity pair and the sentence is stored as a nega-
tive example. Features of an entity pair are extracted
from the sentence containing the entity pair.
As mentioned in Section 1, the assumption of DS
can fail, resulting in wrong assignments of a relation
to sentences that do not express the relation. We call
such assignments wrong labels. An example of a
wrong label is place of birth assigned to the lower
sentence in Figure 1.

ent relations with the same dependency path, such
as ABBA was formed in Stockholm. and ABBA
was formed in 1970.
Our aim is to remove wrong labels assigned to
frequent patterns, which cause poor precision. In-
deed, in our Wikipedia corpus, more than 6% of the
sentences containing the pattern [Person] moved to
[Location], which does not express place of death,
are labeled as place of death, and the labels as-
signed to these sentences hurt extraction perfor-
mance (see Section 7.3.3). We would like to remove
place of death from the sentences that contain this
pattern.
In our method, we reduce the number of wrong
labels as follows: (i) given a labeled corpus with the
DS assumption, we first predict whether a pattern
expresses a relation and then (ii) remove wrong la-
bels using the negative pattern list, which is defined
as patterns that are predicted not to express the rela-
tion. In the first step, we introduce the novel gener-
ative model that directly models DSs labeling pro-
cess and make the prediction (see Section 5). The
second step is formally described in Algorithm 1.
For relation extraction, we train a classifier for en-
tity pairs using the resultant labeled data.

Using a simple example, we describe how we model
brs, the probability with which DS assigns relation r
to pattern s via entity pairs when pattern s does not
express relation r.
Consider two patterns: pattern 1 that expresses re-
lation r and pattern 2 that does not (i.e., zr1 = 1 and
zr2 = 0). We also assume that there are entity pairs
that appear with pattern 1 as well as with pattern 2 in
different places in the corpus (for example, Michael
Jackson and Gary in Figure 1). When such entity
pairs are labeled, relation r is assigned to pattern 1
and at the same time to wrong pattern 2. Such entity
pairs are observed as elements in the intersection of
the two sets of entity pairs, E1 and E2. Here, Es is
the set of entity pairs that appear with pattern s in
the corpus. This situation is described in Figure 3.
We model probability br2 as follows. In E1, an
entity pair is labeled with probability ar. We as-
sume that entity pairs in the intersection, E1 E2,
are also labeled with ar. From the viewpoint of E2,
entity pairs in its subset, E1 E2, are labeled with
ar. Therefore, br2 is modeled as

To infer zrs, we would like to calculate the pos-

is intractable because each zrs depends on the oth-
ers, {(zrt)|t 6= s}, as shown in Eqs.2 and 3. This
prevents us from using the EM algorithm. Instead,
we apply variational approximation to the posterior

Our learning algorithm is derived by calculating
the stationary condition of the resultant evaluation
function with respect to each parameter. We have the
exact solution for r. For each rs and dr, we derive
a fixed point iteration. We update ar by using the
steepest ascent. We update each parameter in turn
while keeping the other parameters fixed. Parameter
updating proceeds until a termination condition is
met.
After learning, we have rs for each pair of rela-
tion r and pattern s. The greater the value of rs is,
the more likely it is that pattern s expresses relation
r. We set a threshold and determine zrs = 0 when
rs is less than the threshold.

We performed two sets of experiments.
Experiment 1 aimed to evaluate the performance of
our generative model itself, which predicts whether
a pattern expresses a relation, given a labeled corpus
created with the DS assumption.
Experiment 2 aimed to evaluate how much our
wrong label reduction in Section 4 improved the per-
formance of relation extraction. In our method, we
trained a classifier with a labeled corpus cleaned by
Algorithm 1 using the negative pattern list predicted
by the generative model.

terms of ability to predict patterns that express a

The input of this task was Xrs, which expresses
whether or not each entity pair appearing with each
pattern is labeled with relation r, as explained in
Section 5. In Experiment 1, since we needed entity
types for patterns, we restricted ourselves to entities
matched with Freebase, which also provides entity
types for entities. We used patterns that appear more

We compared the following methods:
Baseline: This method assigns relation r to a pat-
tern when the pattern is mentioned with at least one
entity pair corresponding to relation r in Freebase.
This method is based on the DS assumption.
Ratio-based Selection (RS): Given relation r and
pattern s, this method calculates nrs/Ns, which is
the ratio of the number of labeled entity pairs ap-
pearing with pattern s to the number of entity pairs
including unlabeled ones. RS then selects the top
n patterns (RS(rank)). We also tested a version us-
ing a real-valued threshold (RS(value)). In train-
ing, we selected the threshold that maximized the
F value. Some bootstrapping approaches (Carlson et
al., 2010) use a rank-based threshold like RS(rank).
Proposed Model (PROP): Using the training data,
we determined the two hyperparameters, and the
threshold to round rs to 1 or 0, so that they max-
imized the F value. When rs is greater than the
threshold, we select pattern s as one expressing re-
lation r.

The results of Experiment 1 are shown in Table 2.
Our model achieved the best precision, recall, and F

completely removed more than one infrequent rela-

real situations. RS(rank) achieved the second high-
est precision. However, its recall, which is also im-
portant in our task, was the lowest and its F value
was almost the same as naive Baseline.
The thresholds of RS, which directly affect their
performance, should be calibrated for each relation,
but it is hard to do this in advance. On the other

features (i.e., features obtained from the dependency
parse tree of a sentence) and lexical features, and en-
tity types, which essentially correspond to the ones
developed by Mintz et al. (2009).
We compared the following methods: logistic re-
gression with the labeled data cleaned by the pro-
posed method (PROP), logistic regression with the
standard DS labeled data (LR), and MultiR proposed
in (Hoffmann et al., 2011) as a state-of-the-art multi-

when more than one relation is assigned to a sen-

avoided this mistake. For place of death, LR and
MultiR wrongly extracted entity pairs with [Per-

does not work for wrong labels assigned to entity
pairs that appear only once in a corpus. In fact, 72%
of entity pairs that appeared with this pattern and
were wrongly labeled as place of death appeared
only once in the corpus. Only PROP avoided mis-
takes of this kind because our method works in such

8 Conclusion
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999605666666667">
We proposed a method that reduces the number of
wrong labels created with the DS assumption, which
is widely applied. Our generative model directly
models the labeling process of DS and predicts pat-
terns that are wrongly labeled with a relation. The
predicted patterns are used for wrong label reduc-
tion. The experimental results show that this method
successfully reduced the number of wrong labels
and boosted the performance of relation extraction.

<abstract confidence="0.99584825">In relation extraction, distant supervision seeks to extract relations between entities from text by using a knowledge base, such as Freebase, as a source of supervision. When a sentence and a knowledge base refer to the same entity pair, this approach heuristically labels the sentence with the corresponding relation in the knowledge base. However, this heuristic can fail with the result that some sentences are labeled wrongly. This noisy labeled data causes poor extraction performance. In this paper, we propose a method to reduce the number of wrong labels. We present a novel generative model that directly models the heuristic labeling process of distant supervision. The model predicts whether assigned labels are correct or wrong via its hidden variables. Our experimental results show that this model detected wrong labels with higher performance than baseline methods. In the experiment, we also found that our wrong label reduction boosted the performance of relation extraction.</abstract>

Since two entities mentioned in a sentence do not always have a relation, we select entity pairs from a corpus when: (i) the path of the dependency parse tree between the corresponding two named entities in the sentence is no longer than 4 and (ii) the path does not contain a sentence-like boundary, such as a relative clause1 (Banko et al., 2007; Banko and Etzioni, 2008). Banko and Etzioni (2008) found that a set of eight lexico-syntactic forms covers nearly 95% of relation phrases in their corpus. (Fader et al. (2011) found that this set covers 69% of their corpus). Our rule is designed to cover at least the eight lexico-syntactic forms. We use the entity pairs extracted by this rule. DS uses a knowledge base to create labeled data for relation extraction by heuristically matching entity pairs. A knowledge base is a set of relation instances about predefined relations. For each sentence in the corpus, we extract all of its entity pa</context>

(2011) applied a rule-based method to the problem by using popular entity types and keywords for each relation. In (Bellare and McCallum, 2007; Riedel et al., 2010; Hoffmann et al., 2011), they used multiinstance learning, which deals with uncertainty of labels, to relax the DS assumption. However, the relaxed assumption can fail when a labeled entity pair is mentioned only once in a corpus (Riedel et al., 2010). Our approach relies on neither of these assumptions. Bootstrapping for relation extraction (Riloff and Jones, 1999; Pantel and Pennacchiotti, 2006; Carlson et al., 2010) is related to our method. In bootstrapping, seed entity pairs of the target relation are given in order to select reliable patterns, which are used to extract new entity pairs. To avoid the selection of unreliable patterns, bootstrapping introduces scoring functions for each pattern candidate. This can be applied to our approach, which seeks to reduce the number of unreliable patterns by using a set of given entity pairs. However, the bootstrappinglike approach suffers from sensitive parameters that are critical to its performance. Ideally, the parameters such as a threshold for scoring funct</context>

This method is based on the DS assumption. Ratio-based Selection (RS): Given relation r and pattern s, this method calculates nrs/Ns, which is the ratio of the number of labeled entity pairs appearing with pattern s to the number of entity pairs including unlabeled ones. RS then selects the top n patterns (RS(rank)). We also tested a version using a real-valued threshold (RS(value)). In training, we selected the threshold that maximized the F value. Some bootstrapping approaches (Carlson et al., 2010) use a rank-based threshold like RS(rank). Proposed Model (PROP): Using the training data, we determined the two hyperparameters, and the threshold to round rs to 1 or 0, so that they maximized the F value. When rs is greater than the threshold, we select pattern s as one expressing relation r. 7.2.3 Result and Discussion The results of Experiment 1 are shown in Table 2. Our model achieved the best precision, recall, and F value. RS(value) had the second best F value, but it completely removed more than one infrequent relation on average in test sets. This is problematic for real situations. R</context>

This can be applied to our approach, which seeks to reduce the number of unreliable patterns by using a set of given entity pairs.

In our approach, parameters are calibrated for each relation by maximizing the likelihood of our generative model. 3 Knowledge-based Distant Supervision In this section, we describe DS for relation extraction. We use the term relation as the relation between two entities. A relation instance is a tuple consisting of two entities and relation r. For example, place of birth(Michael Jackson, Gary) in Figure 1 is a relation instance. Relation extraction seeks to extract relation instances from text.

In the experiment, we also found that our wrong label reduction boosted the performance of relation extraction. 1 Introduction Machine learning approaches have been developed to address relation extraction, which is the task of extracting semantic relations between entities expressed in text. Supervised approaches are limited in scalability because labeled data is expensive to produce. A particularly attractive approach, called distant supervision (DS), creates labeled data by heuristically aligning entities in text with those in a knowledge base, such as Freebase (Mintz et al., 2009). \x01 \x02\x03\x04\x05\x06\x07 \x07\x04\x05\x04\x08\t \x07\x04\x05\x04\x08 \x0c\x02\x03\x0b \x06\x0e \x0f\x05\x01\x04\x10 \x12\x05\x0b\x10\x03 \x02 \x11\x03\x0b\x13\x14\x06\x07 \x17\x03\x01\x08 \x15\x15\x15 \x15\x15\x15 \x15\x15\x15 \x13\x07\x06\x16\x02 \x18\x19 \x0f\x03\x14 \x1a\x1b\x1c\x1d\x1e\x1f !\x1e\x1c&amp;quot;#$% &amp;\&amp;apos;( )*+, -, .\x1e/0 1 \x1a\x1b\x1c\x1d\x1e\x1f !\x1e\x1c&amp;quot;#$% 2*345 6+*2 .\x1e/0 1 \x04 7\x04 89\&amp;apos;:4;*6;)-+&amp;lt;= 89\&amp;apos;:4;*6;)-+&amp;lt;= &amp;gt;?@AB&amp;gt;@CD E&amp;gt;FGECHI Figure 1: Automatic labeling by distant supervision.

The former pattern had higher brs, the probability with which relation r is wrongly assigned to pattern s via entity pairs, because there were more entity pairs that appeared not only with this pattern but also with patterns that was predicted to express place of birth. 7.3 Experiment 2: Relation Extraction We investigated the performance of relation extraction using our wrong label reduction, which uses the results of the pattern prediction. Following Mintz et al. (2009), we performed an automatic held-out evaluation and a manual evaluation.

Our work was inspired by Mintz et al. (2009) who used Freebase as a knowledge base by making the DS assumption and trained relation extractors on Wikipedia. Previous works (Hoffmann et al., 2010; Yao et al., 2010) have pointed out that the DS assumption generates noisy labeled data, but did not directly address the problem. Wang et al.

To avoid the selection of unreliable patterns, bootstrapping introduces scoring functions for each pattern candidate.

The assumption ignores this possibility. For instance, consider the place of birth relation between Michael Jackson and Gary in Figure 1. The upper sentence indeed expresses the place of birth relation between the two entities. In DS place of birth is assigned to the sentence, and it becomes a useful training example. On the other hand, the lower sentence does not express this relation between the two entities, but the DS heuristic wrongly labels the sentence as expressing it. Riedel et al. (2010) relax the DS assumption as at least one sentence containing an entity pair ex721 \x0cpressing the corresponding relation in the knowledge base. They cast the relaxed assumption as multi-instance learning. However, even the relaxed assumption can fail. The relaxation is equivalent to the DS assumption when a labeled pair of entities is mentioned once in a target corpus (Riedel et al., 2010). In fact, 91.7% of entity pairs appear only once in Wikipedia articles (see Section 7).
