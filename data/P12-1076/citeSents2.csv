Our work was inspired by CITATION who used Freebase as a knowledge base by making the DS assumption and trained relation extractors on Wikipedia,,
We applied Open NLP POS tagger5 and MaltParser CITATION to sentences containing more 4 The first-order information becomes zero in ,,
Previous works (CITATION; CITATION) have pointed out that,,
7.1 Dataset Following CITATION, we carried out our experiments using Wikipedia as the target corpus and Freebase (September, 2009, CITATION) as the knowledge base,,
hout any strong assumptions like CITATIONs, the model predicts whether each pattern expresses each relation via hidden variables (see Section 5),,
2 Related Work The increasingly popular approach, called distant supervision (DS), or weak supervision, utilizes a knowledge base to heuristically label a corpus (CITATION; CITATION; CITATION),,
A particularly attractive approach, called distant supervision (DS), creates labeled data by heuristically aligning entities in text with those in a knowledge base, such as Freebase CITATION,,
We applied our method to Wikipedia articles using Freebase as a knowledge base and found that (i) our model identified patterns expressing a given relation more accurately than baseline methods and (ii) our method led to better extraction performance than the original DS CITATION and MultiR CITATION, which is a state-of-the-art multiinstance learning system for relation extraction (see Section 7),,
Following CITATION, we performed an automatic held-out evaluation and a manual evaluation,,
In Wikipedia articles, named entities were identified by anchor text linking to another article and starting with a capital letter CITATION,,
7.3.1 Configuration of Classifiers Following CITATION, we used a multiclass logistic classifier optimized using L-BFGS with Gaussian regularization to classify entity pairs to the predefined 24 relations and NONE,,
We used more than 1,300,000 Wikipedia articles in the wex dump data (September, 2009, (Metaweb CITATION)),,
