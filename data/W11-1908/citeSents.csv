it Abstract Because there is no generally accepted metric for measuring the performance of anaphora resolution systems, a combination of metrics was proposed to evaluate submissions to the 2011 CONLL Shared Task CITATION,,
 1 Introduction Many evaluation metrics have been proposed for anaphora resolution (CITATION; CITATION; CITATION; CITATION; CITATION),,
 This makes it difficult to compare systems, as dramatically demonstrated by the results of the Coreference Task at SEMEVAL 2010 CITATION,,
 We also discuss how the default mention extraction techniques of the system we used for this submission, BART CITATION, were modified to handle the all-mention annotation in the OntoNotes corpus,,
 In this paper, we first briefly provide some background on optimization for anaphora resolution, on genetic algorithms, and on the method for multiobjective optimization we used, Non-Dominated Sorting Genetic Algorithm II CITATION,,
 The first systematic attempt at automatic optimization of anaphora resolution we are aware of was carried out by CITATION, who used genetic algorithms for automatic optimization of both feature selection and of learning parameters, also considering 61 \x0ctwo different machine learners, TimBL and Ripper,,
 Genetic algorithms are known to be more effective for solving MOO than classical methods such as weighted metrics, goal programming CITATION, because of their population-based nature,,
 A particularly popular genetic algorithm of this type is NSGAII CITATION, which we used for our runs,,
1 The BART System For our experiments, we use BART CITATION, a modular toolkit for anaphora resolution that supports state-of-the-art statistical approaches to the task and enables efficient feature engineering,,
 In particular, we have investigated Non-Dominated Sorting Genetic Algorithm II CITATION for multiobjective optimization,,

 And as it happens, techniques for doing just that have been developed in the area of Genetic Algorithmsso-called multi-objective optimization techniques (MOO) CITATION,,
 In a previous study CITATION, we show that our MOO-based approach yields more robust results than single-objective optimization,,
3 Multi-objective Optimization Multi-objective optimization (MOO) can be formally stated as follows CITATION,,

 NP chunks are computed from the parse trees provided in the CoNLL distribution, Named entities are extracted with the Stanford NER tool CITATION,,
 A form of multi-objective optimization was applied to coreference by CITATION,,
 CITATION did not propose to train models so as to simultaneously optimize according to multiple metrics; instead, they used ensemble selection to learn to choose among previously trained models the best model for each example,,
2 Genetic Algorithms Genetic algorithms (GAs) CITATION are randomized search and optimization techniques guided by the principles of evolution and natural genetics,,

 For MOO, the objective functions corresponding to a particular chromosome are F1 = F-measureMUC (for the MUC metric), F2 = F-measure3 (for CEAF using the 3 entity alignment function CITATION) and F3 = F-measure4 (for CEAF using the 3 entity alignment function),,
