In previous work, supertag disambigua-
tion has been presented as a robust, par-
tial parsing technique. In this paper
we present two approaches: contextual
models, which exploit a variety of fea-
tures in order to improve supertag per-
formance, and class-based models, which
assign sets of supertags to words in order
to substantially improve accuracy with
only a slight increase in ambiguity.

1 Introduction

<bodyText confidence="0.990355246376812">
Many natural language applications are beginning
to exploit some underlying structure of the lan-
guage. Roukos (1996) and Jurafsky et al. (1995)
use structure-based language models in the
context of speech applications. Grishman (1995)
and Hobbs et al. (1995) use phrasal information
in information extraction. Alshawi (1996) uses
dependency information in a machine translation
system. The need to impose structure leads to
the need to have robust parsers. There have
been two main robust parsing paradigms: Fi-
nite State Grammar-based approaches (such
as Abney (1990), Grishman (1995), and
Hobbs et al. (1997)) and Statistical Parsing
(such as Charniak (1996), Magerman (1995), and
Collins (1996)).
Srinivas (1997a) has presented a different ap-
proach called supertagging that integrates linguis-
tically motivated lexical descriptions with the ro-
bustness of statistical techniques. The idea un-
derlying the approach is that the computation
of linguistic structure can be localized if lexical
items are associated with rich descriptions (Su-
pertags) that impose complex constraints in a lo-
cal context. Supertag disambiguation is resolved
&amp;quot;Supported by NSF grants ~SBR-9710411 and
~GER-9354869
by using statistical distributions of supertag co-
occurrences collected from a corpus of parses. It
results in a representation that is effectively a
parse (almost parse).
Supertagging has been found useful for a num-
ber of applications. For instance, it can be
used to speed up conventional chart parsers be-
cause it reduces the ambiguity which a parser
must face, as described in Srinivas (1997a).
Chandrasekhar and Srinivas (1997) has shown
that supertagging may be employed in informa-
tion retrieval. Furthermore, given a sentence
aligned parallel corpus of two languages and al-
most parse information for the sentences of one
of the languages, one can rapidly develop a gram-
mar for the other language using supertagging, as
suggested by Bangalore (1998).
In contrast to the aforementioned work in su-
pertag disambiguation, where the objective was
to provide a-direct comparison between trigram
models for part-of-speech tagging and supertag-
ging, in this paper our goal is to improve the per-
formance of supertagging using local techniques
which avoid full parsing. These supertag disam-
biguation models can be grouped into contextual
models and class based models. Contextual mod-
els use different features in frameworks that ex-
ploit the information those features provide in
order to achieve higher accuracies in supertag-
ging. For class based models, supertags are first
grouped into clusters and words are tagged with
clusters of supertags. We develop several auto-
mated clustering techniques. We then demon-
strate that with a slight increase in supertag ambi-
guity that supertagging accuracy can be substan-
tially improved.
The layout of the paper is as follows. In Sec-
tion 2, we briefly review the task of supertagging
and the results from previous work. In Section 3,
we explore contextual models. In Section 4, we
outline various class based approaches. Ideas for
future work are presented in Section 5. Lastly, we

Supertags, the primary elements of the LTAG
formalism, attempt to localize dependencies, in-
cluding long distance dependencies. This is ac-
complished by grouping syntactically or semanti-
cally dependent elements to be within the same
structure. Thus, as seen in Figure 1, supertags
contain more information than standard part-of-
speech tags, and there are many more supertags
per word than part-of-speech tags. In fact, su-
pertag disambiguation may be characterized as
providing an almost parse, as shown in the bottom
part of Figure 1.
Local statistical information, in the form of a
trigram model based on the distribution of su-
pertags in an LTAG parsed corpus, can be used
to choose the most appropriate supertag for any
given word. Joshi and Srinivas (1994) define su-
pertagging as the process of assigning the best
supertag to each word. Srinivas (1997b) and
Srinivas (1997a) have tested the performance of a
trigram model, typically used for part-of-speech
tagging on supertagging, on restricted domains
such as ATIS and less restricted domains such as
Wall Street Journal (WSJ).
In this work, we explore a variety of local
techniques in order to improve the performance
of supertagging. All of the models presented
here perform smoothing using a Good-Turing dis-
counting technique with Katz\&amp;apos;s backoff model.
With exceptions where noted, our models were
trained on one million words of Wall Street Jour-
nal data and tested on 48K words. The data
and evaluation procedure are similar to that used
in Srinivas (1997b). The data was derived by
mapping structural information from the Penn
Treebank WSJ corpus into supertags from the
XTAG grammar (The XTAG-Group (1995)) us-
ing heuristics (Srinivas (1997a)). Using this data,
the trigram model for supertagging achieves an
accuracy of 91.37%, meaning that 91.37% of the
words in the test corpus were assigned the correct
supertag.1

]eared their country might split again&amp;quot; the pres-
ence of might influences the choice of the supertag
for ]eared, an influence that is not accounted for by
the trigram model. As described below, we show
that the introduction of features which take into
account aspects of head-dependency relationships
improves the accuracy of supertagging.

3.1 One Pass Head Trigram Model
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.9886208">
In a head model, the prediction of the current su-
pertag is conditioned not on the immediately pre-
ceding two supertags, but on the supertags for the
two previous head words. This model may thus
be considered to be using a context of variable
length. 2 The sentence &amp;quot;Many Indians feared their
country might split again&amp;quot; shows a head model\&amp;apos;s
strengths over the trigram model. There are at
least two frequently assigned supertags for the
word ]eared: a more frequent one corresponding
to a subcategorization of NP object (as ~n of
Figure 1) and a less frequent one to a S comple-
ment. The supertag for the word might, highly
probable to be modeled as an auxiliary verb in
this case, provides strong evidence for the latter.
Notice that might and ]eared appear within a head
model\&amp;apos;s two head window, but not within the tri-
gram model\&amp;apos;s two word window. We may there-
fore expect that a head model would make a more
accurate prediction.
Srinivas (1997b) presents a two pass head tri-
gram model. In the first pass, it tags words as
either head words or non-head words. Training
data for this pass is obtained using a head percola-
tion table (Magerman (1995)) on bracketed Penn
Treebank sentences. After training, head tagging
is performed according to Equation 1, where 15is
the estimated probability and H(i) is a charac-
teristic function which is true iff word i is a head
word.

The second pass then takes the words with this

ePart of speech tagging models have not used heads
in this manner to achieve variable length contexts.
Variable length n-gram models, one of which is de-
scribed in Niesler and Woodland (1996), have been
used instead.

This model achieves an accuracy of 87%, lower
than the trigram model\&amp;apos;s accuracy.
Our current approach differs significantly. In-
stead of having heads be defined through the use
of the head percolation table on the Penn Tree-
bank, we define headedness in terms of the su-
pertags themselves. The set of supertags can nat-
urally be partitioned into head and non-head su-
pertags. Head supertags correspond to those that
represent a predicate and its arguments, such as
a3 and a7. Conversely, non-head supertags corre-
spond to those supertags that represent modifiers
or adjuncts, such as ~1 and ~2.
Now, the tree that is assigned to a word during
supertagging determines whether or not it is to
be a head word. Thus, a simple adaptation of the
Viterbi algorithm suffices to compute Equation 2
in a single pass, yielding a one pass head trigram
model. Using the same training and test data, the
one pass head model achieved 90.75% accuracy,
constituting a 28.8% reduction in error over the
two pass head trigram model. This improvement
may come from a reduction in error propagation
or the richer context that is being used to predict
heads.

3.2 Mixed Head and Trigram Models
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999397772727273">
The head mod.el skips words that it does not con-
sider to be head words and hence may lose valu-
able information. The lack of immediate local con-
text hurts the head model in many cases, such as
selection between head noun and noun modifier,
and is a reason for its lower performance relative
to the trigram model. Consider the phrase &amp;quot;...,
or $ 2.48 a share.&amp;quot; The word 2.48 may either be
associated with a determiner phrase supertag (~1)
or a noun phrase supertag (ag). Notice that 2.48
is immediately preceded by $ which is extremely
likely to be supertagged as a determiner phrase
031). This is strong evidence that 2.48 should be
supertagged as a9. A pure head model cannot
consider this particular fact, however, because 131
is not a head supertag. Thus, local context and
long distance head dependency relationships are
both important for accurate supertagging.
A 5-gram mixed model that includes both the
trigram and the head trigram context is one ap-
proach to this problem. This model achieves a
performance of 91.50%, an improvement over both

We hypothesize that the improvement is limited
because of a large increase in the number of pa-
rameters to be estimated.
As an alternative, we explore a 3-gram mixed
model that incorporates nearly all of the relevant
information. This mixed model may be described
as follows. Recall that we partition the set of
all supertags into heads and modifiers. Modifiers
have been defined so as to share the characteristic
that each one either modifies exactly one item to
the right or one item to the left. Consequently,
we further divide modifiers into left modifiers (134)
and right modifiers. Now, instead of fixing the
conditioning context to be either the two previous
tags (as in the trigram model) or the two pre-
vious head tags (as in the head trigram model)
we allow it to vary according to the identity of
the current tag and the previous conditioning con-
text, as shown in Table 1. Intuitively, the mixed
model is like the trigram model except that a mod-
ifier tag is discarded from the conditioning context
when it has found an object of modification. The
mixed model achieves an accuracy of 91.79%, a
significant improvement over both the head tri-
gram model\&amp;apos;s and the trigram model\&amp;apos;s accuracies,
p &amp;lt; 0.05. Furthermore, this mixed model is com-
putationally more efficient as well as more accu-
rate than the 5-gram model.

The mixed trigram and head word model takes into
account local (supertag) context and long distance
(head word) context. Both of these models ap-
pear to suffer from severe sparse data problems.
It is not surprising, then, that the head word
model achieves an accuracy of only 88.16%, and
the mixed trigram and head word model achieves
an accuracy of 89.46%. We were only able to
train the latter model with 250K of training data
because of memory problems that were caused
by computing the large parameter space of that
model.

the use of more elaborate backoff techniques. On
the other hand, we could consider using decision
trees at choice points in order to decide which fea-
tures are most relevant at each point. However, we
have currently experimented with classifier combi-
nation as a means of ameliorating the sparse data
problem while making use of the feature combina-
tions that we have introduced.

their predictions are combined using various vot-
ing strategies.
The same 1000K word test corpus is used in
models of classifier combination as is used in pre-
vious models. We created three distinct partitions
of this 1000K word corpus, each partition consist-
ing of a 900K word training corpus and a 100K
word tune corpus. In this manner, we ended up
with a total of 300K word tuning data.
We consider three voting strategies suggested
by van Halteren et al. (1998): equal vote, where
each classifier\&amp;apos;s vote is weighted equally, overall
accuracy, where the weight depends on the over-
all accuracy of a classifier, and pair\&amp;apos;wise voting.
Pairwise voting works as follows. First, for each
pair of classifiers a and b, the empirical prob-
ability ~(tcorrectltctassilier_atclassiyier_b) is com-
puted from tuning data, where tclassiyier-a and
tct~ssiy~e~-b are classifier a\&amp;apos;s and classifier b\&amp;apos;s su-
pertag assignment for a particular word respec-
tively, and t.... ect is the correct supertag. Sub-
sequently, on the test data, each classifier pair
votes, weighted by overall accuracy, for the su-
pertag with the highest empirical probability as
determined in the previous step, given each indi-
vidual classifier\&amp;apos;s guess.
The results from these voting strategies are pos-
itive. Equal vote yields an accuracy of 91.89%.
Overall accuracy vote has an accuracy of 91:93%.
Pairwise voting yields an accuracy of 92.19%,
the highest supertagging accuracy that has been
achieved, a 9.5% reduction in error over the tri-
gram model.
The table of accuracy of combinations of pairs
of classifiers is shown in Table 3.3 The effi-
cacy of pairwise combination (which has signifi-
cantly fewer parameters to estimate) in ameliorat-
ing the sparse data problem can be seen clearly.
For example, the accuracy of pairwise combina-
tion of head classifier and trigram classifier ex-
ceeds that of the 5-gram mixed model. It is also

3-gram mixed model. It is also notable that the
pairwise combination of the head word classifier
and the mix word classifier yields a significant im-
provement over either classifier, p &amp;lt; 0.05, consid-
ering the disparity between the accuracies of its
component classifiers.

We also compare various models\&amp;apos; performance
on base-NP detection and PP attachment disam-
biguation. The results will underscore the adroit-
ness of the classifier combination model in using
both local and long distance features. They will
also show that, depending on the ultimate appli-
cation, one model may be more appropriate than
another model.
A base-NP is a non-recursive NP structure
whose detection is useful in many applications,
such as information extraction. We extend our su-
pertagging models to perform this task in a fash-
ion similar to that described in Srinivas (1997b).
Selected models have been trained on 200K words.
Subsequently, after a model has supertagged the
test corpus, a procedure detects base-NPs by scan-
ning for appropriate sequences of supertags. Re-
sults for base-NP detection are shown in Table 4.
Note that the mixed model performs nearly as well
as the trigram model. Note also that the head
trigram model is outperformed by the other mod-
els. We suspect that unlike the trigram model, the
head model does not perform the accurate mod-
eling of local context which is important for base-
NP detection.
In contrast, information about long distance de-
pendencies are more important for the the PP at-
tachment task. In this task, a model must de-
cide whether a PP attaches at the NP or the VP
level. This corresponds to a choice between two
PP supertags: one associated with NP attach-
ment, and another associated with VP attach-
ment. The trigram model, head trigram model,
3-gram mixed model, and classifier combination
model perform at accuracies of 78.53%, 79.56%,
80.16%, and 82.10%, respectively, on the PP at-

<bodyText confidence="0.999746043478261">
Contextual models tag each word with the sin-
gle most appropriate supertag. In many applica-
tions, however, it is sufficient to reduce ambiguity
to a small number of supertags per word. For
example, using traditional TAG parsing methods,
such are described in Schabes (1990), it is ineffi-
cient to parse with a large LTAG grammar for En-
glish such as XTAG (The XTAG-Group (1995)).
In these circumstances, a single word may be as-
sociated with hundreds of supertags. Reducing
ambiguity to some small number k, say k &amp;lt; 5 su-
pertags per word4 would accelerate parsing con-
siderably. 5 As an alternative, once such a reduc-
tion in ambiguity has been achieved, partial pars-
ing or other techniques could be employed to iden-
tify the best single supertag. These are the aims
of class based models, which assign a small set of
supertags to each word. It is related to work by
Brown et al. (1992) where mutual information is
used to cluster words into classes for language
modeling. In our work with class based models,
we have considered only trigram based approaches
so far.

One reason why the trigram model of supertag-
ging is limited in its accuracy is because it con-
siders only a small contextual window around
the word to be supertagged when making its
tagging decision. Instead of using this limited
context to pinpoint the exact supertag, we pos-
tulate that it may be used to predict certain

structural characteristics of the correct supertag
with much higher accuracy. In the context class
model, supertags that share the same character-
istics are grouped into classes and these classes,
rather than individual supertags, are predicted
by a trigram model. This is reminiscent of
Samuelsson and Reich (1999) where some part of
speech tags have been compounded so that each
word is deterministically in one class.
The grouping procedure may be described as
follows. Recall that each supertag corresponds to
a lexicalized tree t E G, where G is a particu-
lar LTAG. Using standard FIRST and FOLLOW
techniques, we may associate t with FOLLOW
and PRECEDE sets, FOLLOW(t) being the set
of supertags that can immediately follow t and
PRECEDE(t) being those supertags that can im-
mediately precede t. For example, an NP tree such
as 81 would be in the FOLLOW set of a supertag
of a verb that subcategorizes for an NP comple-
ment. We partition the set of all supertags into
classes such that all of the supertags in a particu-
lar class are associated with lexicalized trees with
the same PRECEDE and FOLLOW sets. For in-
stance, the supertags tx and t2 corresponding re-
spectively to the NP and S subcategorizations of
a verb ]eared would be associated with the same
class. (Note that a head NP tree would be a mem-
ber of both FOLLOW(t1) and FOLLOW(t2).)
The context class model predicts sets of su-
pertags for words as follows. First, the trigram
model supertags each word wi with supertag ti
that belongs to class Ci.6 Furthermore, using the
training corpus, we obtain set D~ which contains
all supertags t such that ~(wilt) &gt; 0. The word
wi is relabeled with the set of supertags C~ N Di.
The context class model trades off an increased
ambiguity of 1.65 supertags per word on average,
for a higher 92.51% accuracy. For the purpose of
comparison, we may compare this model against
a baseline model that partitions the set of all su-
pertags into classes so that all of the supertags in
one class share the same preterminal symbol, i.e.,
they are anchored by words which share the same
part of speech. With classes defined in this man-
ner, call C~ the set of supertags that belong to
the class which is associated with word w~ in the
test corpus. We may then associate with word w~
the set of supertags C~ gl Di, where Di is defined
as above. This baseline procedure yields an aver-

4.2 Confusion Class Model
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999750244444444">
The confusion class model partitions supertags
into classes according to an alternate procedure.
Here, classes are derived from a confusion matrix
analysis of errors which the trigram model makes
while supertagging. First, the trigram model su-
pertags a tune set. A confusion matrix is con-
structed, recording the number of times supertag
t~ was confused for supertag tj, or vice versa,
in the tune set. Based on the top k pairs of
supertags that are most confused, we construct
classes of supertags that are confused with one
another. For example, let tl and t2 be two PP
supertags which modify an NP and VP respec-
tively. The most common kind of mistake that
the trigram model made on the tune data was to
mistag tl as t2, and vice versa. Hence, tl and t2
are clustered by our method into the same con-
fusion class. The second most common mistake
was to confuse supertags that represent verb mod-
ifier PPs and those that represent verb argument
PPs, while the third most common mistake was to
confuse supertags that represent head nouns and
noun modifiers. These, too, would form their own
classes.
The confusion class model predicts sets of su-
pertags for words in a manner similar to the con-
text class model. Unlike the context class model,
however, in this model we have to choose k, the
number of pairs of supertags which are extracted
from the confusion matrix over which confusion
classes are formed. In our experiments, we have
found that with k = 10, k = 20, and k = 40,
the resulting models attain 94.61% accuracy and
1.86 tags per word, 95.76% accurate and 2.23 tags
per word, and 97.03% accurate and 3.38 tags per
word, respectively/
Results of these, as well as other models dis-
cussed below, are plotted in Figure 2. The n-best
model is a modification of the trigram model in
which the n most probable supertags per word are
chosen. The classifier union result is obtained by

We are considering extending our work in sev-
eral directions. Srinivas (1997b) discussed a
lightweight dependency analyzer which assigns de-
pendencies assuming that each word has been as-
signed a unique supertag. We are extending this
algorithm to work with class based models which
narrows down the number of supertags per word
with much higher accuracy. Aside from the n-
gram modeling that was a focus of this paper,
we would also like to explore using other kinds
of models, such as maximum entropy.

6 Conclusions
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.977662818181818">
We have introduced two different kinds of models
for the task of supertagging. Contextual mod-
els show that features for accurate supertagging
only produce improvements when they are appro-
priately combined. Among these models were: a
one pass head model that reduces propagation of
head detection errors of previous models by using
supertags themselves to identify heads; a mixed
model that combines use of local and long distance
information; and a classifier combination model
that ameliorates the sparse data problem that is
worsened by the introduction of many new fea-
tures. These models achieve better supertagging
accuracies than previously obtained. We have also
introduced class based models which trade a slight
increase in ambiguity for significantly higher accu-
racy. Different class based methods are discussed,
and the tradeoff between accuracy and ambiguity
is demonstrated.

As may be expected, the trigram model performs the worst on this task, presumably because it is restricted to considering purely local information. 4 Class Based Models Contextual models tag each word with the single most appropriate supertag. In many applications, however, it is sufficient to reduce ambiguity to a small number of supertags per word. For example, using traditional TAG parsing methods, such are described in Schabes (1990), it is inefficient to parse with a large LTAG grammar for English such as XTAG (The XTAG-Group (1995)). In these circumstances, a single word may be associated with hundreds of supertags. Reducing ambiguity to some small number k, say k &amp;lt; 5 supertags per word4 would accelerate parsing considerably. 5 As an alternative, once such a reduction in ambiguity has been achieved, partial parsing or other techniques could be employed to identify the best single supertag. These are the aims of class based models, which assign a small set of supertags to each word. It is related to work by Brown et al. </context>

In the first pass, it tags words as either head words or non-head words. Training data for this pass is obtained using a head percolation table (Magerman (1995)) on bracketed Penn Treebank sentences. After training, head tagging is performed according to Equation 1, where 15is the estimated probability and H(i) is a characteristic function which is true iff word i is a head word. n H ~ argmaxH H~(wilH(i))~(H(i)lH(i-1)H(i-2)) i=1 (1) The second pass then takes the words with this head information and supertags them according to Equation 2, where tH(io)</context>

(1995) use structure-based language models in the context of speech applications. Grishman (1995) and Hobbs et al. (1995) use phrasal information in information extraction. Alshawi (1996) uses dependency information in a machine translation system. The need to impose structure leads to the need to have robust parsers. There have been two main robust parsing paradigms: Finite State Grammar-based approaches (such as Abney (1990), Grishman (1995), and Hobbs et al. (1997)) and Statistical Parsing (such as Charniak (1996), Magerman (1995), and Collins (1996)). Srinivas (1997a) has presented a different approach called supertagging that integrates linguistically motivated lexical descriptions with the robustness of statistical techniques. The idea underlying the approach is that the computation of linguistic structure can be localized if lexical items are associated with rich descriptions (Supertags) that impose complex constraints in a local context. Supertag disambiguation is resolved &amp;quot;Supported by NSF grants ~SBR-9710411 and ~GER-9354869 by using statistical distributions of supertag cooccurrences collected from a corpus of parses.

Thus, as seen in Figure 1, supertags contain more information than standard part-ofspeech tags, and there are many more supertags per word than part-of-speech tags. In fact, supertag disambiguation may be characterized as providing an almost parse, as shown in the bottom part of Figure 1. Local statistical information, in the form of a trigram model based on the distribution of supertags in an LTAG parsed corpus, can be used to choose the most appropriate supertag for any given word. Joshi and Srinivas (1994) define supertagging as the process of assigning the best supertag to each word. Srinivas (1997b) and Srinivas (1997a) have tested the performance of a trigram model, typically used for part-of-speech tagging on supertagging, on restricted domains such as ATIS and less restricted domains such as Wall Street Journal (WSJ). In this work, we explore a variety of local techniques in order to improve the performance of supertagging. All of the models presented here perform smoothing using a Good-Turing discounting technique with Katz\&amp;apos;s backoff model. With exceptions where noted, our models were trained on one million words of Wall Street Journal data and tested on 48K words. The data and ev</context>

There are at least two frequently assigned supertags for the word ]eared: a more frequent one corresponding to a subcategorization of NP object (as ~n of Figure 1) and a less frequent one to a S complement. The supertag for the word might, highly probable to be modeled as an auxiliary verb in this case, provides strong evidence for the latter.

All of the models presented here perform smoothing using a Good-Turing discounting technique with Katz\&amp;apos;s backoff model. With exceptions where noted, our models were trained on one million words of Wall Street Journal data and tested on 48K words. The data and evaluation procedure are similar to that used in Srinivas (1997b). The data was derived by mapping structural information from the Penn Treebank WSJ corpus into supertags from the XTAG grammar (The XTAG-Group (1995)) using heuristics (Srinivas (1997a)). Using this data, the trigram model for supertagging achieves an accuracy of 91.37%, meaning that 91.37% of the words in the test corpus were assigned the correct supertag.1 3 Contextual Models As noted in Srinivas (1997b), a trigram model often fails to capture the cooccurrence dependencies 1The supertagging accuracy of 92.2% reported in Srinivas (1997b) was based on a different supertag tagset; specifically, the supertag corpus was reannotated with detailed supertags for punctuation and with a different analysis for subordinating conjunctions. between a </context>

As may be expected, the trigram model performs the worst on this task, presumably because it is restricted to considering purely local information. 4 Class Based Models Contextual models tag each word with the single most appropriate supertag. In many applications, however, it is sufficient to reduce ambiguity to a small number of supertags per word. For example, using traditional TAG parsing methods, such are described in Schabes (1990), it is inefficient to parse with a large LTAG grammar for English such as XTAG (The XTAG-Group (1995)). In these circumstances, a single word may be associated with hundreds of supertags. Reducing ambiguity to some small number k, say k &amp;lt; 5 supertags per word4 would accelerate parsing considerably. 5 As an alternative, once such a reduction in ambiguity has been achieved, partial parsing or other techniques could be employed to identify the best single supertag. These are the aims of class based models, which assign a small set of supertags to each word. It is related to work by Brown et al. (1992) where mutual information is used to cluster words into classes for language modeling. In our wo</context>
