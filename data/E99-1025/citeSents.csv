For instance, it can be used to speed up conventional chart parsers because it reduces the ambiguity which a parser must face, as described in CITATIONa),,
Using this data, the trigram model for supertagging achieves an accuracy of 91.37%, meaning that 91.37% of the words in the test corpus were assigned the correct supertag.1 3 Contextual Models As noted in CITATIONb), a trigram model often fails to capture the cooccurrence dependencies 1The supertagging accuracy of 92.2% reported in CITATIONb) was based on a different supertag tagset; specifically, the supertag corpus was reannotated with detailed supertags for punctuation and with a different analysis for subordinating conjunctions,,
5An alternate approach to TAG parsing that effectively shares the computation associated with each lexicalized elementary tree (supertag) is described in CITATION,,
Furthermore, given a sentence aligned parallel corpus of two languages and almost parse information for the sentences of one of the languages, one can rapidly develop a grammar for the other language using supertagging, as suggested by CITATION,,
The data and evaluation procedure are similar to that used in CITATIONb),,
CITATIONa) has presented a different approach called supertagging that integrates linguistically motivated lexical descriptions with the robustness of statistical techniques,,
The data was derived by mapping structural information from the Penn Treebank WSJ corpus into supertags from the XTAG grammar (The CITATION) using heuristics (CITATIONa)),,
CITATION on bracketed Penn Treebank sentences,,
Variable length n-gram models, one of which is described in CITATION, have been used instead,,
Training data for this pass is obtained using a head percolation table CITATION on bracketed Penn Treebank sentences,,
CITATION has shown that supertagging may be employed in information retrieval,,
For example, using traditional TAG parsing methods, such are described in CITATION, it is inefficient to parse with a large LTAG grammar for English such as XTAG (The CITATION),,
CITATION define supertagging as the process of assigning the best supertag to each word,,
This is reminiscent of CITATION where some part of speech tags have been compounded so that each word is deterministically in one class,,
CITATIONb) and CITATIONa) have tested the performance of a trigram model, typically used for part-of-speech tagging on supertagging, on restricted domains such as ATIS and less restricted domains such as Wall Street Journal (WSJ),,
CITATIONb) presents a two pass head trigram model,,
CITATION and CITATION use phrasal information in information extraction,,
CITATION and CITATION use structure-based language models in the context of speech applications,,
CITATIONa) has presented a different approach called supertagging that integrates linguistically motivated lexical descriptions w,,
We extend our supertagging models to perform this task in a fashion similar to that described in CITATIONb),,
CITATIONa) ,,
CITATIONa) has presented a different a,,
CITATIONa) has presented a different approach called supertagging that integrates linguistically motivated lexical descriptions with the robustness of st,,
CITATIONb) discussed a lightweight dependency analyzer which assigns dependencies assuming that each word has been assigned a unique supertag,,
CITATION uses dependency information in a machine translation system,,
There have been two main robust parsing paradigms: Finite State Grammar-based approaches (such as CITATION, CITATION, and CITATION) and Statistical Parsing (such as CITATION, CITATION, and CITATION),,
