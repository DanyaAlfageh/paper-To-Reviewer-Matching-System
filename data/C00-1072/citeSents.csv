As indicated by CITATION the majority of relevant documents for topic 258 have the query topic as their main theme; while the others mostly have the query topics as their subsidiary themes,,1
We plan to apply text segmentation algorithms such as TextTiling CITATION to segment documents into subtopic units,,1
One can gauge the ecacy 6The mutual information is de\x0cned according to chapter 2 of CITATION and is not the pairwise mutual information used in CITATION,,0
select a con\x0cdence level from the \x1f2 distribution table; determine the cuto\x0b associated weight and the number of terms to be included in the signatures 5 The Corpus The training data derives from the Question and Answering summary evaluation data provided by TIPSTER-SUMMAC CITATION that is a subset of the TREC collections,,1
As discussed in CITATION, we propose using an existing ontology such as SENSUS CITATION to identify signature term relations,,0
For example, the University of Massachusetts CIRCUS system used in the MUC-3 CITATION terrorism domain required about 1500 person-hours to de\x0cne extraction patterns2 (Rilo\x0b, 1996),,0
Instead of \x1f2 , we use likelihood ratio CITATION \x15, since \x15 is more appropriate for sparse data than \x1f2 test and the quantity 2log\x15 is asymptotically \x1f2 distributed5 ,,0
The SUMMONS (SUMMarizing Online NewS articles) system CITATION takes template outputs of information extraction systems developed for MUC conference and generating summaries of multiple news articles,,0
Recent advances in the query expansion CITATION can also shed some light on the creation of topic signatures,,1
3 SUMMARIST SUMMARIST CITATION is a system designed to generate summaries of multilingual input texts,,0
2 Related Work In late 1970\'s, DeJong CITATION developed a system called FRUMP (Fast Reading Understanding and Memory Program) to skim newspaper stories and extract the main details,,1
Text segmentation algorithms such as TextTiling CITATION can be used to \x0cnd subtopic segments in text,,1
