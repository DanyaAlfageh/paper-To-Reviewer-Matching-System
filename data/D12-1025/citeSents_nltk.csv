6 MT Experiments and Results 6.1 Data In our MT experiments, we translate French into Spanish and use the following corpora to learn our translation systems: Europarl Corpus CITATION: The Europarl parallel corpus is extracted from the proceedings of the European Parliament and includes versions in 11 European languages.,,
EMEA Corpus CITATION: EMEA is a parallel corpus made out of PDF documents from the European Me,,
(CITATIONb) propose several modifications to the existing algorithms.,,
We apply slice sampling CITATION to scale up to ciphers with a very large vocabulary.,,
Slice sampling CITATION can solve this problem by automatically adjusting the number of samples to be considered for each sampling operation.,,
3.5 Parallel Sampling Inspired by CITATION, our parallel sampling procedure is described below: Collect bigrams and their counts from ciphertext and split the bigrams into N parts.,,
In the first experiment, we compare our method with (CITATIONb) on their data set to prove correctness of our approach.,,
