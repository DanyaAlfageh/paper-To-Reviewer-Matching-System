ilable for every domain, performance of SMT systems drops significantly when translating out-of-domain texts CITATION,,
Theoretically, we can directly apply EM, as proposed in CITATION, or Bayesian decipherment (CITATIONa) to solve the problem,,
6.2 Results BLEU CITATION is used as a standard evaluation metric,,
(CITATIONb) propose several modifications to the existing algorithms,,
5.1 Baseline SMT System We build a state of the art phrase-based SMT system using Moses CITATION,,
(CITATIONb) propo,,
(CITATIONb) have shown that one can use decipherment to learn a full translation model from non-parallel data,,
Recently, there has been an increasing interest in decipherment work (CITATIONa; CITATION),,
Slice sampling CITATION can solve this problem by automatically adjusting the number of samples to be considered for each sampling operation,,

4.1 Deciphering Transtac Corpus 4.1.1 Data We split the Transtac corpus the same way it was split in (CITATIONb),,
We apply slice sampling CITATION to scale up to ciphers with a very large vocabulary,,
(CITATIONb) propose several modifications to the existing algorith,,
6 MT Experiments and Results 6.1 Data In our MT experiments, we translate French into Spanish and use the following corpora to learn our translation systems: Europarl Corpus CITATION: The Europarl parallel corpus is extracted from the proceedings of the European Parliament and includes versions in 11 European languages,,
EMEA Corpus CITATION: EMEA is a parallel corpus made out of PDF documents from the European Medicines Agency,,
Table 3: Sample Decoding Results on Transtac Corpus from (CITATIONb) to perform the decoding,,
Is it possible to use domain specific monolingual data to improve an MT system trained on parallel texts from a different domain? Some researchers have attempted to do this by adding a domain specific dictionary CITATION, or mining unseen words CITATION using one of several translation lexicon induction techniques (CITATION; CITATION; CITATION),,
3.1 Bayesian Decipherment Bayesian inference has been widely used in natural language processing (CITATION; CITATION; CITATIONb),,
t phrase-based SMT system using Moses CITATION,,
3.5 Parallel Sampling Inspired by CITATION, our parallel sampling procedure is described below: Collect bigrams and their counts from ciphertext and split the bigrams into N parts,,
In the first experiment, we compare our method with (CITATIONb) on their data set to prove correctness of our approach,,
We use Moses CITATION 3 Except for combining the counts to form a new count table, other parameters remain the same,,
Unfortunately, as parallel corpora are expensive and not available for every domain, performance of SMT systems drops significantly when translating out-of-domain texts CITATION,,
