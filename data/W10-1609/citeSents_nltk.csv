We built a set of datasets based on public available datasets for English, together to SPARTE CITATION, an available Corpus in Spanish,,
Another related antecedent was Answer Validation Exercise (AVE), part of Cross Language Evaluation Forum (CLEF), whose objective is to develop systems which are able to decide whether the answer to a question is correct or not CITATION,,
However, some comparison with other results for Spanish could be done in AVE Challenge (Alberto TellezValero et al., 2008; Ferrandez et al., 2008; CITATION), but we will need to modify our system to test AVE 2008 test set and computing different metric for the ranking of the result,,
The string similarity between two lists of tokens is reduced to the problem of bipartite graph matching, performed using the Hungarian algorithm CITATION over this bipartite graph,,
We used four classifiers to learn every development set: (1) Support Vector Machine, (2) Ada Boost, (3) Multilayer Perceptron (MLP) and (4) Decision Tree using the open source WEKA Data Mining Software CITATION,,
The system produces feature vectors for the available development data RTE3, RTE4, RTE5, and SPARTECITATION,,
In the past, RTEs Challenges machine learning algorithms were widely used for the task of recognizing textual entailment (Marneffe et al., 2006; Zanzotto et al., 2007; CITATION) and they have reported goods results for English language,,
Word sense disambiguation using the Lesk algorithm CITATION, based on Wordnet definitions,,
