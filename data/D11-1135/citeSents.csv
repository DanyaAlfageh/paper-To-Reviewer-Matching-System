 However, less explored are open-domain approaches where the set of possible relation types are not fixed and little to no labeled is given for each relation type (CITATION; Banko and Etzioni, 2008),,
 For example, DIRT CITATION aims to discover different representations of the same semantic relation using distributional similarity of dependency paths,,
 CITATION present an Unsupervised semantic parsing (USP) approach to partition dependency trees into meaningful fragments (or parts to use their terminology),,
 The first two models, Rel-LDA and Rel-LDA1 are simple extensions of the standard LDA model CITATION,,
 Following typical EM learningCITATION, we start with a much simpler generative model, expose the model to fewer features first, and iteratively add more features,,
3 Type-LDA model We know that relations can only hold between certain entity types, known as selectional preferences (CITATION; CITATION; CITATION),,
 For instance, knowing that the entity Steve Balmer bears the leaderOf relation to the entity Microsoft, would facilitate question answering CITATION, data mining, and a host of other end-user applications,,
 Due to these many potential applications, relation extraction has gained much attention in information extraction (CITATION; CITATION; CITATION; CITATION; CITATION),,
 First we employ Stanford tools to tokenize, sentence-split and Part-Of-Speech tag CITATION a document,,
 Next we recognize named entities CITATION by labelling tokens with PERSON, ORGANIZATION, LOCATION, MISC and NONE tags,,
 Finally we parse each sentence of a document using MaltParser CITATION and extract dependency paths for each pair of named entity mentions in one sentence,,
 Following DIRT CITATION, we filter out tuples that do not satisfy the following constraints,,
