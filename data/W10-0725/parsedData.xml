Abstract

<bodyText confidence="0.9983973">
This paper describes our experiments of us-
ing Amazons Mechanical Turk to generate
(counter-)facts from texts for certain named-
entities. We give the human annotators a para-
graph of text and a highlighted named-entity.
They will write down several (counter-)facts
about this named-entity in that context. The
analysis of the results is performed by com-
paring the acquired data with the recognizing
textual entailment (RTE) challenge dataset.

1 Motivation
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.99959">
The task of RTE (Dagan et al., 2005) is to say
whether a person would reasonably infer some short
passage of text, the Hypothesis (H), given a longer
passage, the Text (T). However, collections of such
T-H pairs are rare to find and these resources are the
key to solving the problem.
The datasets used in the RTE task were collected
by extracting paragraphs of news text and manu-
ally constructing hypotheses. For the data collected
from information extraction task, the H is usually
a statement about a relation between two named-
entities (NEs), which is written by expertise. Simi-
larly, the H in question answering data is constructed
using both the question and the (in)correct answers.
Therefore, the research questions we could ask are,
</bodyText>
<listItem confidence="0.994766">
1. Are these hypotheses really those ones people
interested in?
2. Are hypotheses different if we construct them
in other ways?
3. What would be a good negative hypotheses
</listItem>
<bodyText confidence="0.996507916666667">
compared with the positive ones?
In this paper, we address these issues by using
Amazons Mechanical Turk (MTurk), online non-
expert annotators (Snow et al., 2008). Instead of
constructing the hypotheses targeted to IE or QA, we
just ask the human annotators to come up with some
facts they consider as relevant to the given text. For
negative hypotheses, we change the instruction and
ask them to write counter-factual but still relevant
statements. In order to narrow down the content of
the generated hypotheses, we give a focused named-
entity (NE) for each text to guide the annotators.

The early related research was done by Cooper et al.
(1996), where they manually construct a textbook-
style corpus aiming at different semantic phenom-
ena involved in inference. However, the dataset is
not large enough to train a robust machine-learning-
based RTE system. The recent research from the
RTE community focused on acquiring large quan-
tities of textual entailment pairs from news head-
lines (Burger and Ferro, 2005) and negative exam-
ples from sequential sentences with transitional dis-
course connectives (Hickl et al., 2006). Although
the quality of the data collected were quite good,
most of the positive examples are similar to summa-
rization and the negative examples are more like a
comparison/contrast between two sentences instead
of a contradiction. Those data are the real sen-
tences used in news articles, but the way of obtain-
ing them is not necessarily the (only) best way to

\x0cfind entailment pairs. In this paper, we investigate
an alternative inexpensive way of collecting entail-
ment/contradiction text pairs by crowdsourcing.
In addition to the information given by the text,
common knowledge is also allowed to be involved
in the inference procedure. The Boeing-Princeton-
ISI (BPI) textual entailment test suite1 is specifically
designed to look at entailment problems requiring
world knowledge. We will also allow this in the de-
sign of our task.

3 Design of the Task
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999815730769231">
The basic idea of the task is to give the human an-
notators a paragraph of text with one highlighted
named-entity and ask them to write some (counter-
)facts about it. In particular, we first preprocess
an existing RTE corpus using a named-entity rec-
ognizer to mark all the named-entities appearing in
both T and H. When we show the texts to Turkers,
we highlight one named-entity and give them one of
these two sets of instructions:
Facts: Please write several facts about the high-
lighted words according to the paragraph. You
may add additional common knowledge (e.g.
Paris is in France), but please mainly use the
information contained in the text. But please
do not copy and paste!
Counter-Facts: Please write several statements that
are contradictory to the text. Make your state-
ments about the highlighted words. Please use
the information mainly in the text. Avoid using
words like not or never.
Then there are three blank lines given for the annota-
tors to fill in facts or counter-factual statements. For
each HIT, we gather facts or counter-facts for five
texts, and for each text, we ask three annotators to
perform the task. We give Turkers one example as a
guide along with the instructions.

2009), and we preprocess the data using the Stan-
ford named-entity recognizer (Finkel et al., 2005).
In all, it contains 600 T-H pairs, and we use the texts
to generate facts and counter-facts and hypotheses as
references. We put our task online through Crowd-
Flower2, and on average, we pay one cent for each
(counter-)fact to the Turkers. CrowdFlower can help
with finding trustful Turkers and the data were col-
lected within a few hours.
To get a sense of the quality of the data we collect,
we mainly focus on analyzing the following three
aspects: 1) the statistics of the datasets themselves;
2) the comparison between the data we collect and
the original RTE dataset; and 3) the comparison be-
tween the facts and the counter-facts.
Table 1 show some basic statistics of the data we
collect. After excluding invalid and trivial ones3, we
acquire 790 facts and 203 counter-facts. In general,
the counter-facts seem to be more difficult to obtain
than the facts, since both the total number and the
average number of the counter-facts are less than
those of the facts. Notice that the NEs are not many
since they have to appear in both T and H.
The comparison between our data and the original
RTE data is shown in Table 2. The average length of
the generated hypotheses is longer than the original
hypotheses, for both the facts and the counter-facts.
Counter-facts seem to be more verbose, since addi-
tional (contradictory) information is added. For in-
stance, example ID 425 in Table 4, Counter Fact 1
can be viewed as the more informative but contra-
dictory version of Fact 1 (and the original hypoth-

Invalid data include empty string or single words; and the
trivial ones are those sentences directly copied from the texts.

\x0cesis). The average bag-of-words similarity scores
are calculated by dividing the number of overlap-
ping words of T and H by the total number of words
in H. In the original RTE dataset, the entailed hy-
potheses have a higher BoW score than the contra-
dictory ones; while in our data, facts have a lower
score than the counter-facts. This might be caused
by the greater variety of the facts than the counter-
facts. Fact 1 of example ID 425 in Table 4 is almost
the same as the original hypothesis, and Fact 2 of
example ID 374 as well, though the latter has some
slight differences which make the answer different
from the original one. The NE position in the sen-
tence is another aspect to look at. We find that peo-
ple tend to put the NEs at the beginning of the sen-
tences more than other positions, while in the RTE
datasets, NEs appear in the middle more frequently.
In order to get a feeling of the quality of the
data, we randomly sampled 50 generated facts and
counter-facts and manually compared them with the
original hypotheses. Table 3 shows that generated
facts are easier for the systems to recognize, and the
counter-facts have the same difficulty on average.
Although it is subjective to evaluate the difficulty
of the data by human reading, in general, we follow
</bodyText>
<listItem confidence="0.9422734">
the criteria that
1. Abstraction is more difficult than extraction;
2. Inference is more difficult than the direct en-
tailment;
3. The more sentences in T are involved, the more
</listItem>
<bodyText confidence="0.981808333333333">
difficult that T-H pair is.
Therefore, we view the Counter Fact 1 in example
ID 16 in Table 4 is more difficult than the original
hypothesis, since it requires more inference than the
direct fact validation. However, in example ID 374,
Fact 1 is easier to be verified than the original hy-
pothesis, and same as those facts in example ID 506.
Similar hypotheses (e.g. Fact 1 in example ID 425
and the original hypothesis) are treated as being at
the same level of difficulty.
After the quantitive analysis, lets take a closer
look at the examples in Table 4. The facts are usually
constructed by rephrasing some parts of the text (e.g.
in ID 425, after a brief inspection is paraphrased
by investigated by in Fact 2) or making a short

summary (e.g. Fact 1 in ID 374, George Stranahan
spoke of Thompsons death.). For counter-facts, re-
moving the negation words or changing into another
adjective is one common choice, e.g. in ID 374,
Counter Fact 1 removed nt and Counter Fact 3
changed never into fully. The antonyms can
also make the contradiction, as rotten to great
in Counter Fact 2 in ID 374.
Example ID 506 in Table 4 is another interest-
ing case. There are many facts about Yemen, but
no valid counter-facts are generated. Furthermore,
if we compare the generated facts with the original
hypothesis, we find that people tend to give straight-
forward facts instead of abstracts4.
At last, we show some preliminary results on test-
ing a baseline RTE system on this dataset. For
the sake of comparison, we extract a subset of the
dataset, which is balanced on entailment and con-
tradiction text pairs, and compare the results with
the same system on the original RTE-5 dataset. The
baseline system uses a simple BoW-based similar-
ity measurement between T and H (Bentivogli et al.,
2009) and the results are shown in Table 5.
The results indicate that our data are slightly eas-
ier than the original RTE-5 dataset, which is consis-
tent with our human evaluation on the sampled data

5 Conclusion and Future Work
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.99967375">
In this paper, we report our experience of using
MTurk to collect facts and counter-facts about the
given NEs and texts. We find that the generated hy-
potheses are not entirely the same as the original
hypotheses in the RTE data. One direct extension
would be to use more than one NE at one time, but it
may also cause problems, if those NEs do not have
any relations in-between. Another line of research
would be to test this generated resources using some
real existing RTE systems and compare the results
with the original RTE datasets, and also further ex-
plore the potential application of this resource.

For each HIT, we gather facts or counter-facts for five texts, and for each text, we ask three annotators to perform the task. We give Turkers one example as a guide along with the instructions. 4 Experiments and Results The texts we use in our experiments are the development set of the RTE-5 challenge (Bentivogli et al., 1 http://www.cs.utexas.edu/ pclark/ bpi-test-suite/ Total Average (per Text) Extracted NEs Facts 244 1.19 Counter-Facts 121 1.11 Generated Hypotheses Facts 790 3.85 Counter-Facts 203 1.86 Table 1: The statistics of the (valid) data we collect. The Total column presents the number of extracted NEs and generated hypotheses and the Average column shows the average numbers per text respectively. 2009), and we preprocess the data using the Stanford named-entity recognizer (Finkel et al., 2005). In all, it contains 600 T-H pairs, and we use the texts to generate facts and counter-facts and hypotheses as references. We put our task online through Crowd- Flower2, and on average, we pay one cent for each (counter-)fact to the Turkers. CrowdFlower can help with finding trustful Turkers and the data were collected within a few hours. To get a sense of the quality of the data we collect, we mainly focus on analyzing the following three aspects: 1) the statistics of the datasets themselves; 2) the comparison between the data we collect and the original RTE dataset; and 3) the comparison between the facts and the counter-facts. Table 1 show some basic statistics of the data we collect. After excluding invalid and trivial ones3, we acquire 790 facts and 203 counter-facts. In general, the counter-facts seem to be more difficult to obtain than the facts, since both the total number and the average number of the counter-facts are less than those of the facts. Notice that the NEs are not many since they have to appear in both T and H. The comparison between our data and the original RTE data is shown in Table 2. The average length of the generated hypotheses is longer than the original hypotheses, for both the facts and the counter-facts. Counter-facts seem to be more verbose, since additional (contradictory) information is added. For instance, example ID 425 in Table 4, Counter Fact 1 can be viewed as the more informative but contradictory version of Fact 1 (and the original hypoth- 2 http://crowdflower.com/ 3 Invalid data include empty string or single words; and the trivial ones are those sentences directly copied from the texts. 164 \x0cesis). The average bag-of-words similarity scores are calculated by dividing the number of overlapping words of T and H by the total number of words in H. In the original RTE dataset, the entailed hypotheses have a higher BoW score than the contradictory ones; while in our data, facts have a lower score than the counter-facts. This might be caused by the greater variety of the facts than the counterfacts. Fact 1 of example ID 425 in Table 4 is almost the same as the original hypothesis, and Fact 2 of example ID 374 as well, though the latter has some slight differences which make the answer different from the original one. The NE position in the sentence is another aspect to look at. We find that people tend to put the NEs at the beginning of the sentences more than other positions, while in the RTE datasets, NEs appear in the middle more frequently. In order to get a feeling of the quality of the data, we randomly sampled 50 generated facts and counter-facts and manually compared them with the original hypotheses. Table 3 shows that generated facts are easier for the systems to recognize, and the counter-facts have the same difficulty on average. Although it is subjective to evaluate the difficulty of the data by human reading, in general, we follow the criteria that 1. Abstraction is more difficult than extraction; 2. Inference is more difficult than the direct entailment; 3. The more sentences in T are involved, the more difficult that T-H pair is. Therefore, we view the Counter Fact 1 in example ID 16 in Table 4 is more difficult than the original hypothesis, since it requires more inference than the direct fact validation. However, in example ID 374, Fact 1 is easier to be verified than the original hypothesis, and same as those facts in example ID 506. Similar hypotheses (e.g. Fact 1 in example ID 425 and the original hypothesis) are treated as being at the same level of difficulty. After the quantitive analysis, lets take a closer look at the examples in Table 4. The facts are usually constructed by rephrasing some parts of the text (e.g. in ID 425, after a brief inspection is paraphrased by investigated by in Fact 2) or making a short Valid Harder Easier Same Facts 76% 16% 24% 36% Counter-Facts 84% 36% 36% 12% Table 3: The comparison of the generated (counter-)facts with the original hypotheses. The Valid column shows the percentage of the valid (counter-)facts; and other columns present the distribution of harder, easier cases than the original hypotheses or with the same difficulty. RTE-5 Our Data Counter-/Facts 300/300 178/178 All YES 50% 50% BoW Baseline 57.5% 58.4% Table 5: The results of baseline RTE systems on the data we collected, compared with the original RTE-5 dataset. The Counter-/Facts row shows the number of the T-H pairs contained in the dataset; and the other scores in percentage are accuracy of the systems. summary (e.g. Fact 1 in ID 374, George Stranahan spoke of Thompsons death.). For counter-facts, removing the negation words or changing into another adjective is one common choice, e.g. in ID 374, Counter Fact 1 removed nt and Counter Fact 3 changed never into fully. The antonyms can also make the contradiction, as rotten to great in Counter Fact 2 in ID 374. Example ID 506 in Table 4 is another interesting case. There are many facts about Yemen, but no valid counter-facts are generated. Furthermore, if we compare the generated facts with the original hypothesis, we find that people tend to give straightforward facts instead of abstracts4. At last, we show some preliminary results on testing a baseline RTE system on this dataset. For the sake of comparison, we extract a subset of the dataset, which is balanced on entailment and contradiction text pairs, and compare the results with the same system on the original RTE-5 dataset. The baseline system uses a simple BoW-based similarity measurement between T and H (Bentivogli et al., 2009) and the results are shown in Table 5. The results indicate that our data are slightly easier than the original RTE-5 dataset, which is consistent with our human evaluation on the sampled data 4 But this might also be caused by the design of our task.</abstract>

However, it is still too early to draw conclusions based on the simple baseline results. 5 Conclusion and Future Work In this paper, we report our experience of using MTurk to collect facts and counter-facts about the given NEs and texts. We find that the generated hypotheses are not entirely the same as the original hypotheses in the RTE data. One direct extension would be to use more than one NE at one time, but it may also cause problems, if those NEs do not have any relations in-between. Another line of research would be to test this generated resources using some real existing RTE systems and compare the results with the original RTE datasets, and also further explore the potential application of this resource.

Charles Street (CSEB 226-B) Baltimore, MD 21218, USA ccb@cs.jhu.com.edu Abstract This paper describes our experiments of using Amazons Mechanical Turk to generate (counter-)facts from texts for certain namedentities. We give the human annotators a paragraph of text and a highlighted named-entity. They will write down several (counter-)facts about this named-entity in that context. The analysis of the results is performed by comparing the acquired data with the recognizing textual entailment (RTE) challenge dataset. 1 Motivation The task of RTE (Dagan et al., 2005) is to say whether a person would reasonably infer some short passage of text, the Hypothesis (H), given a longer passage, the Text (T). However, collections of such T-H pairs are rare to find and these resources are the key to solving the problem. The datasets used in the RTE task were collected by extracting paragraphs of news text and manually constructing hypotheses. For the data collected from information extraction task, the H is usually a statement about a relation between two namedentities (NEs), which is written by expertise. Similarly, the H in question answering data is constructed </context>

What would be a good negative hypotheses compared with the positive ones? In this paper, we address these issues by using Amazons Mechanical Turk (MTurk), online nonexpert annotators (Snow et al., 2008).
