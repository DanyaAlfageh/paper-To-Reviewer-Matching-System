For example, simply adding whether each word is part of a noun or verb phrase using the handannotated parse tree (the so-called GOV feature from CITATION) improves the performance of our system from 83.95% to 85.8%,,
Many current solutions are complicated, consist of several stages and handbuilt features, and are too slow to be applied as part of real applications that require such semantic labels, partly because of their use of a syntactic parser (CITATION; CITATION),,
In CITATION the authors presented a statistical approach to learning (for FrameNet), with some success,,
CITATION,,
They proposed to take advantage of the syntactic tree structure that can be predicted by a parser, such as Charniaks parser CITATION,,
5.2 Argument Classification Accuracy So far we have not used the same accuracy measures as in previous work (CITATION; CITATION),,
We measured the argument classification accuracy of our network, assuming the correct segmentation is given to our system, as in CITATION, by post-processing our per-word tags to form a majority vote over each segment,,
