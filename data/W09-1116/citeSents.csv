Both CITATION and CITATION show that learned gender is the most important feature in their pronoun resolution systems,,
Thus previous approaches rely on either hand-crafted coreferenceindicating patterns CITATION, or iteratively guess and improve gender models through expectation maximization of pronoun resolution (Cherry and CITATION; CITATION),,
We use the approach of CITATION, both because it achieves state-of-the-art gender classification performance, and because a database of the obtained noun genders is available online.1 CITATION use an unsupervised algorithm to identify syntactic paths along which a noun and pronoun are highly likely to corefer,,
Since the training pairs are acquired from a sparse and imperfect model of gender, what can we gain by training over them? We can regard the CITATION approach and our discriminative system as two orthogonal views of gender, in a co-training sense CITATION,,
Some of these may yield to more sophisticated joint classification of coreference and gender, perhaps along the lines of work in named-entity classification CITATION or anaphoricity CITATION,,
While gender has been shown to be the key feature for statistical pronoun resolution (CITATION; CITATION), it remains to be seen whether the exceptional accuracy obtained here will translate into improvements in resolution performance,,
