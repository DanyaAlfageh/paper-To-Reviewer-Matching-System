Different from CITATION, we employ a large-scale entity repository to extract more meaningful and interpretable key terms (entities), which make each subtopic much easier to understand,,
In addition, we compare our approach with Stanford NER CITATION and fine-grained entity recognition (FIGER) CITATION,,
For short-text NER, CITATION proposed a graphical model,,
For cross-domain NER, CITATION employed search engines,,
A common approach is to utilize a Named Entity Recognition (NER) system like Stanford NER CITATION, which recognizes the names of things (e.g., person and product names) from texts,,
To address the problem, CITATION defined a fine-grained set of 112 tags based on Freebase for entity extraction,,
The metro maps proposed in CITATION are also related to our work,,
