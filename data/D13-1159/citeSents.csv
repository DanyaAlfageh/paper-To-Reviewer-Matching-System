These categories give shallow semantics of UGC, and boosts the performance of information retrieval (CITATION; CITATION; CITATION) and recommendation (CITATION; CITATION),,
To construct similarity functions, pattern-based approaches (CITATION; CITATION) utilize first-order co-occurrences while distributional similarity approaches (CITATION; CITATION) emplo,,
8; CITATION),,
Given two entities ta and tb, PB calculates their similarity based on the number of RASCs containing both of them CITATION: Sim(ta, tb) = log(1 + rab X i=1 Pabi )) p idf(ta) idf(tb), (2) where idf(ta) = ,,
10 Following CITATION, we set to 0.2,,
The metro maps proposed in CITATION are also related to our work,,
However, tags are not widely applicable and tags are usually sparse CITATION,,
Topic models, such as latent Dirichlet allocation (LDA) CITATION, are widely applied in document clustering and classification, However, it is not trivial to control the granularity of topics CITATION,,
In addition, we compare our approach with Stanford NER CITATION and fine-grained entity recognition (FIGER) CITATION,,
In the following, we briefly introduce the patternbased approach (PB) and the distributional similarity approach (DS) in CITATION,,
e metro maps proposed in CITATION are also related to our work,,
CITATION found that PB performed better when dealing with proper nouns; while DS was relatively good at estimating similarity of other types of entities,,
ties is computed using the approach in CITATION, which estimates the similarity of two terms according to their firstorder and second-order co-occurrences,,
ory hierarchy CITATION to make content within the same category more topically cohesive,,
However, for topic models, it is not easy to control the granularity of topics, and it is hard for users to interpret a topic only based on the multinomial distribution CITATION,,
With new content kept adding into a hierarchy, we need to maintain category hierarchy CITATION to make content within the same category more topically cohesive,,
For cross-domain NER, CITATION employed search engines,,
Whats more, it is generally difficult to understand a topic only from the multinomial distribution CITATION,,
(CITATIONa) proposed an entity-based classification for tweets,,
Besides, (CITATIONb) proposed an entitybased translation language model and demonstrated that it outperformed classical translation language model in question retrieval,,
The similarity function in our ER follows the suggestion of CITATION: if at least one entity is proper noun, PB is employed; otherwise DS is used,,
Social tagging provides an alternative approach in document organization CITATION,,
For social tagging, it is not applicable in many sites and has sparsity problem CITATION,,
Different from CITATION, we employ a large-scale entity reposit,,
Traditionally, we can utilize topic models CITATION or social tagging to structuralize UGC,,
nce of information retrieval (CITATION; CITATION; CITATION) and recommendation (CITATION; CITATION),,
In addition, entity-based retrieval models were proposed and applied in both QA archives (CITATIONa) and tweets (CITATIONb),,
In this paper, we follow the work in CITATION and employ an agglomerative clustering algorithm for two reasons: 1) it is easy to implement and its time complexity is O(N2); 2) there is no need to set the number of clusters,,
ng the approach in CITATION, which estimates the similarity of two terms according to their firstorder and second-order co-occurrences,,
The work in CITATION, which automatically generates and updates topic terms to organize UGC, is mostly related to our work,,
Given two entities ta and tb, PB calculates their similarity based on the number of RASCs containing both of them CITATION: Sim(ta, tb) = log(1 + rab X i=1 Pabi )) p idf(,,
As reported in CITATION, B-cubed metrics are more suitable than traditional metrics, such as NMI and purity,,
CITATION utilized Wikipedia to classify documents,,
In our entity repository, the similarity between two entities is computed using the approach in CITATION, which estimates the similarity of two terms according to their firstorder and second-order co-occurrences,,
However, in CITATION more external sources are utilized to identify subtopics,,
The work in CITATION, which automatically generates and updates topic terms to organize UGC, i,,
cial tagging provides an alternative approach in document organization CITATION,,
Following the work in CITATION, we collect information from 5 aspects: familiarity, easiness, satisfaction, adequate time, and helpfulness,,
For short-text NER, CITATION proposed a graphical model,,
Different from CITATION, we employ a large-scale entity repository to extract more meaningful and interpretable key terms (entities), which make each subtopic much easier to understand,,
Any other advanced algorithms like spectral clustering CITATION can also be applied, but that is not the emphasis of this paper,,
To construct similarity functions, pattern-based approaches (CITATION; CITATION) utilize first-order co-occurrences while distributional similarity approaches (CITATION; CITATION) employ second-order co-occurrences,,
However, traditional question retrieval models CITATION such as QLLM and VSM do not capture key semantics and give more weights for entity terms,,
A common approach is to utilize a Named Entity Recognition (NER) system like Stanford NER CITATION, which recognizes the names of things (e.g., person and product names) from texts,,
To address the problem, CITATION defined a fine-grained set of 112 tags based on Freebase for entity extraction,,
