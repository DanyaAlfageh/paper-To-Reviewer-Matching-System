6.1 Text Encoding We encode our text similarly to CITATION,,
CITATION provided us with their list of reported speech verbs; 3,,
We used the POS tagger from CITATION; 4,,
6.2 Features In our experiments we use the feature set from CITATION,,
The work most similar to ours is the work by CITATION,,
To identify potential speakers they used the Stanford NER tagger CITATION and a method outlined in CITATION that allowed them to find nominal character references,,
In the news domain, both CITATION and CITATION proposed rulebased systems that work over large volumes of text,,
More recently, SAPIENS, a Frenchlanguage quote extraction and attribution system, was developed by de La CITATION,,
In related work, CITATION built a lexicon of French reported speech verbs, and conducted some analysis of different types of quotes,,
CITATION approached the task with a three stage method,,
CITATION is the only study that directly uses machine learning in quote attribution, treating the task as a classification task, where each quote is attributed independently of other quotes,,

To identify potential speakers they used the Stanford NER tagger CITATION and a method outlined in CITATION that allowed them to find nominal character references,,
While the results of CITATION appear encouraging, they are misleading for two reasons,,
3.1 Columbia Quoted Speech Attribution Corpus (LIT) The first corpus we use was originally created by CITATION,,
These documents had already been annotated with named entities as part of a separate research project CITATION, which includes manually constructed coreference chains,,
3.4 Corpus Comparisons In order to compare the corpora we categorise the quotes into the categories defined by CITATION, as shown in Table 1,,
p We use two classifiers: a logistic regression implementation available in LIBLINEAR CITATION, and a Conditional Random Field (CRF) from CRFSuite CITATION,,

ifferent quote, or a reported speech verb Quote features about q itself, including whether s is mentioned within it, whether other speakers are mentioned within it, how far the quote is from the start of its paragraph and the length in words of q Sequence features that depend on the speakers chosen for the previous quotes, includes number of quotes in the 10 paragraphs preceding and including the paragraph where q appears that were attributed to s, and the number that were attributed to other speakers 6.3 Elson and McKeown Reimplementation As part of our study we reproduce the core results of CITATION (E&M ), as we believe it is a state-of-the-art system,,
Using a binary class with reconciliation in a greedy decoding model is equivalent to the method in CITATION, except that the gold standard sequence features are replaced with predicted sequence features,,
10 Conclusion In this paper, we present the first large-scale evaluation of a quote attribution system on newswire from the 1989 Wall Street Journal (WSJ) and the 2009 Sydney Morning Herald (SMH), as well as comparing against previous work CITATION on 19th-century literature,,

It also has the advantage of avoiding the label bias problem that would be present in the equivalent Hidden Markov Model CITATION,,
790 \x0c2 Background Early work into quote attribution by CITATION focused on identifying when different characters were talking in childrens stories, so that a speech synthesis system could read the quoted parts in different voices,,
CITATION conducted similar research on childrens stories written in Portuguese,,
In the news domain, both CITATION and CITATION proposed rulebased systems that work over large volumes of text,,
6 Experimental Setup We use two classifiers: a logistic regression implementation available in LIBLINEAR CITATION, and a Conditional Random Field (CRF) from CRFSuite CITATION,,
6.1 Text Encoding We encode our text similarly to CITATION,,
Recent work by CITATION conducted further annotation of this corpus, including reconstructing attributions that were only partially annotated, and introducing additional information,,
For the set of potential speakers we use the BBN pronoun coreference and entity type corpus CITATION, with automatically coreferred pronouns,,

The two new corpora are from news articles from the Wall Street Journal and the Sydney Morning Herald respectively, while the third corpus is an extension to the classic literature corpus from CITATION,,
