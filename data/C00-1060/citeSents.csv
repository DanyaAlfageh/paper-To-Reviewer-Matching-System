However, recent advances in HPSG parsing CITATION enabled us to obtain a unique parse tree with our system in 0.5 sec,,1
For comparison, we applied our method to the same 1,246 sentences that CITATION used,,1
This idea is similar to that of CITATIONs study, which restricts the candidates to five, but in his case, without a grammar,,1
CITATION, and JUMANs outputs are used for POS classification,,0
These models are estimated by the ChoiceMaker Maximum Entropy Estimator CITATION,,0
This idea is similar to that of CITATIONs study, which restricts the candidates to five, but ,,0
The decision tree model CITATION achieves around 85%, the integrated model of lexical/syntactic information CITATION achieves around 86%, and the lexicalized statistical model CITATION achieves 86.8% in bunsetsu accuracy,,0
In general lines, this model corresponds to models such as (CITATION; CITATION; CITATION),,0
 3.1 Restriction of Modification Candidates CITATION report that when modification candidates are enumerated according to SLUNG, 98.6% of the correct modifiees are in one of the following three positions among the candidates: the nearest one from the modifier, the second nearest one, and the farthest one,,0
CITATION proposed a model using posterior context,,0
2.3 SLUNG : Japanese Grammar The Japanese grammar which we adopted, SLUNG CITATION, is an HPSG-based underspecified grammar,,0
4.1 Environments We used the EDR Japanese Corpus CITATION for training and evaluation of parsing accuracy,,1
There are some models which calculate the likelihood values of a dependency between bunsetsu i and j as in (6), such as a decision tree model CITATION, a maximum entropy model CITATION, a model based on distance and lexical information CITATION,,0
Some of them (CITATION; CITATION) treat information on contexts, but the contextual information is derived only from a structure to which the parser is trying to assign a likelihood value,,1
HPSG-based Japanese grammar, SLUNG CITATION and the maximum entropy method (Berger et al., 1996),,0
P(i cn) def = P(n |i, c1 , c2 ) (n = 1, 2) (8) P(i cn) def = P(n |i, c1 , c2 , cl ) (n = 1, 2, l)(9) 2This heuristics is a Japanese version of a left-association rule: see CITATION for detail,,0
CITATION), it may be thought more reasonable to use high-level grammars just for postprocessing which maps results of shallow syntactical analyses onto deep analyses,,0
CITATION also used the Kyoto corpus, and their accuracy was 87.9%,,1

1 Introduction There have been many attempts to combine handcrafted high-level grammars, such as FB-LTAG, HPSG and LFG, and statistical disambiguation techniques to obtain precise linguistic structures (CITATION; CITATION; CITATION),,0
2.2 Statistical Approaches with a grammar There have been many proposals for statistical frameworks particularly designed for parsers with hand-crafted grammars (CITATION; CITATION; CITATION; CITATION),,0
(1998) used the Kyoto University text corpus CITATION for evaluation and achieved around 86%,,0
CITATION discussed the precision of argument structures,,0
