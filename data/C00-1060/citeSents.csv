 1 Introduction There have been many attempts to combine handcrafted high-level grammars, such as FB-LTAG, HPSG and LFG, and statistical disambiguation techniques to obtain precise linguistic structures (CITATION; CITATION; CITATION),,
 CITATION), it may be thought more reasonable to use high-level grammars just for postprocessing which maps results of shallow syntactical analyses onto deep analyses,,
2 Statistical Approaches with a grammar There have been many proposals for statistical frameworks particularly designed for parsers with hand-crafted grammars (CITATION; CITATION; CITATION; CITATION),,
 Some of them (CITATION; CITATION) treat information on contexts, but the contextual information is derived only from a structure to which the parser is trying to assign a likelihood value,,
 These models are estimated by the ChoiceMaker Maximum Entropy Estimator CITATION,,
 CITATION, and JUMANs outputs are used for POS classification,,

 However, recent advances in HPSG parsing CITATION enabled us to obtain a unique parse tree with our system in 0,,
 CITATION discussed the precision of argument structures,,
1 Environments We used the EDR Japanese Corpus CITATION for training and evaluation of parsing accuracy,,
 There are some models which calculate the likelihood values of a dependency between bunsetsu i and j as in (6), such as a decision tree model CITATION, a maximum entropy model CITATION, a model based on distance and lexical information CITATION,,
 CITATION proposed a model using posterior context,,
 In general lines, this model corresponds to models such as (CITATION; CITATION; CITATION),,
 The decision tree model CITATION achieves around 85%, the integrated model of lexical/syntactic information CITATION achieves around 86%, and the lexicalized statistical model CITATION achieves 86,,
 (1998) used the Kyoto University text corpus CITATION for evaluation and achieved around 86%,,
 CITATION also used the Kyoto corpus, and their accuracy was 87,,
 For comparison, we applied our method to the same 1,246 sentences that CITATION used,,

1 Restriction of Modification Candidates CITATION report that when modification candidates are enumerated according to SLUNG, 98,,
 This idea is similar to that of CITATIONs study, which restricts the candidates to five, but ,,

 HPSG-based Japanese grammar, SLUNG CITATION and the maximum entropy method (Berger et al,,

3 SLUNG : Japanese Grammar The Japanese grammar which we adopted, SLUNG CITATION, is an HPSG-based underspecified grammar,,
 P(i cn) def = P(n |i, c1 , c2 ) (n = 1, 2) (8) P(i cn) def = P(n |i, c1 , c2 , cl ) (n = 1, 2, l)(9) 2This heuristics is a Japanese version of a left-association rule: see CITATION for detail,,

1 Restriction of Modification Candidates CITATION report that when modification candidates are enumerated according to SLUNG, 98,,
 This idea is similar to that of CITATIONs study, which restricts the candidates to five, but in his case, without a grammar,,
