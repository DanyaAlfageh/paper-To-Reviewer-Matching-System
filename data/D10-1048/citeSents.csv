 1 Introduction Recent work on coreference resolution has shown that a rich feature space that models lexical, syntactic, semantic, and discourse phenomena is crucial to successfully address the task (CITATION; CITATION; Haghighi and Klein, 2010),,
 When such a rich representation is available, even a simple deterministic model can achieve state-of-the-art performance CITATION,,
 2 Related Work This work builds upon the recent observation that strong features outweigh complex models for coreference resolution, in both supervised and unsupervised learning setups (CITATION; CITATION),,
 Most coreference resolution approaches perform the task by aggregating local decisions about pairs of mentions (CITATION; CITATION; CITATION; Stoyanov, 2010),,
 Two recent works that diverge from this pattern are CITATION and CITATION,,

 We use the following attributes for these constraints: Number we assign number attributes based on: (a) a static list for pronouns; (b) NER labels: mentions marked as a named entity are considered singular with the exception of organizations, which can be both singular or plural; (c) part of speech tags: NN*S tags are plural and all other NN* tags are singular; and (d) a static dictionary from CITATION,,

 We sort candidate antecedents using syntactic information provided by the Stanford parser, as follows: Same Sentence Candidates in the same sentence are sorted using left-to-right breadth-first traversal of syntactic trees CITATION,,

 Subjects are more probable antecedents for pronouns CITATION,,

, one cannot be a child NP in the others NP constituent CITATION,,
 The CITATION numbers have two variants: with semantics (+S) and without (S),,
 Amongst the comparisons, several are supervised (CITATION; CITATION; CITATION),,
 The system of CITATION +S uses a lexicon of semantically-compatible noun pairs acquired transductively, i,,
 Our system does not rely on labeled corpora for training (like supervised approaches) nor access to corpora during testing (like CITATION),,
 The system that is closest to ours is CITATION S,,
 To understand if the difference is due to the multi-pass architecture or the richer feature set we compared CITATION S against both our multi-pass system and its single-pass variant,,
 The comparison indicates that both these contributions help: our single-pass system outperforms CITATION consistently, and the multi-pass architecture further improves the performance of our single-pass system between 1 and 4 F1 points, depending on the corpus and evaluation metric,,
