For a fair comparison with previous work, we do not use gold named entity labels or mention types but, instead, take the labels provided by the Stanford named entity recognizer (NER) CITATION,,
3.2 Evaluation Metrics We use three evaluation metrics widely used in the literature: (a) pairwise F1 CITATION computed over mention pairs in the same entity cluster; (b) MUC CITATION which measures how many predicted clusters need to be merged to cover the gold clusters; and (c) B3 (Amit and CITATION) which uses the intersection between predicted and gold clusters for a given mention to mark correct mentions and the sizes of the the predicted and gold clusters as denominators for precision and recall, respectively,,

We parse all documents using the Stanford parser CITATION,,
