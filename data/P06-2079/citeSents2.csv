2.2 Polarity Classification There is a large body of work on classifying the polarity of a document (e.g., CITATION, CITATION), a sentence (e.g., CITATION, CITATION, CITATION, CITATION), a phrase (e.g., CITATION), and a specific object (such as a product) mentioned in a document (e.g., CITATION, CITATION, CITATION),,
Much work has been performed on learning to identify and classify polarity terms (i.e., terms expressing a positive sentiment (e.g., happy) or a negative sentiment (e.g., terrible)) and exploiting them to do polarity classification (e.g., CITATION, CITATION, CITATION, CITATION, CITATION),,
There have been attempts on tackling this so-called document-level subjectivity classification task, with very encouraging results (see CITATION and CITATION for details),,
