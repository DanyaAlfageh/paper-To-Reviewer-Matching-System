Two notable exceptions are the work of CITATION and CITATION,,
There have been several attempts at extracting features for polarity classification from dependency parses, but most focus on extracting specific types of information such as adjective-noun relations (e.g., CITATION, CITATION) or nouns that enjoy a dependency relation with a polarity term (e.g., CITATION),,
CITATION extract a larger variety of features from dependency parses, but unlike us, their goal is to determine the polarity of a phrase, not a document,,
Unlike most previous work on polarity classification, which has largely focused on exploiting adjective-noun (AN) relations (e.g., CITATION, CITATION), we hypothesized that subject-verb (SV) and verb-object (VO) relations would also be useful for the task,,
Much work has been performed on learning to identify and classify polarity terms (i.e., terms expressing a positive sentiment (e.g., happy) or a negative sentiment (e.g., terrible)) and exploiting them to do polarity classification (e.g., CITATION, CITATION, CITATION, CITATION, CITATION),,

We conjecture that more sophisticated methods would be needed in order to take advantage of objective information in polarity classification (e.g., CITATION),,

The negative results that CITATION obtained when using bigrams as features for their polarity classifier seem to suggest that high-order n-grams are not useful for polarity classification,,
However, recent research in the related (but arguably simpler) task of text classification shows that a bigrambased text classifier outperforms its unigrambased counterpart CITATION,,
