 In essence, the same formalism is used in the syntactic analysis in J~rvinen (1994) and CITATION,,
 Dekang CITATION has earlier used this kind of evaluation, where precision and recall were for subjects 87 % and 78 %, and for complements (including objects) 84 % and 72 %, respectively,,
 CITATION, several heads are allowed,,
 CITATION, have brought the strict projectivity (context-free) requirement into the dependency framework,,
 This kind of restriction is present in many dependency-based parsing systems (CITATION; CITATION; CITATION),,
