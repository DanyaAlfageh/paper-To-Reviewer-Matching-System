 Early efforts of named entity translation have focused on using phonetic feature (called PH) to estimate a phonetic similarity between two names (CITATION; CITATION; CITATION),,
 In contrast, some approaches have focused on using context feature (called CX) which compares surrounding words of entities (CITATION; CITATION; CITATION),,
 Recently, holistic approaches combining such similarities have been studied (CITATION; CITATION; CITATION),,
 CITATION rank translation candidates using PH and CX independently and return results with the highest average rank,,
 CITATION compute initial translation scores using PH and iteratively update the scores using relationship feature (called R),,
 CITATION boost Yous approach by additionally leveraging CX,,
 2 Preliminaries Our approach follows a graph alignment framework proposed in CITATION,,
 To identify entities, we use a CRF-based named entity tagger CITATION and a Chinese word breaker CITATION for English and Chinese corpora, respectively,,
 For PH, we use a variant of Edit-Distance CITATION between English entity and a romanized representation of Chinese entity called Pinyin,,
