This paper studies named entity trans-
lation and proposes selective temporal-
ity as a new feature, as using temporal
features may be harmful for translating
atemporal entities. Our key contribution
is building an automatic classifier to dis-
tinguish temporal and atemporal entities
then align them in separate procedures to
boost translation accuracy by 6.1%.

1 Introduction

<bodyText confidence="0.995346">
Named entity translation discovery aims at map-
ping entity names for people, locations, etc. in
source language into their corresponding names in
target language. As many new named entities ap-
pear every day in newspapers and web sites, their
translations are non-trivial yet essential.
Early efforts of named entity translation have
focused on using phonetic feature (called PH)
to estimate a phonetic similarity between two
names (Knight and Graehl, 1998; Li et al., 2004;
Virga and Khudanpur, 2003). In contrast, some
approaches have focused on using context feature
(called CX) which compares surrounding words
of entities (Fung and Yee, 1998; Diab and Finch,
2000; Laroche and Langlais, 2010).
Recently, holistic approaches combining such
similarities have been studied (Shao and Ng, 2004;
You et al., 2010; Kim et al., 2011). (Shao and
Ng, 2004) rank translation candidates using PH
and CX independently and return results with the
highest average rank. (You et al., 2010) compute
initial translation scores using PH and iteratively
update the scores using relationship feature (called
R). (Kim et al., 2011) boost Yous approach by ad-
ditionally leveraging CX.
More recent approaches consider temporal fea-
ture (called T) of entities in two corpora (Klemen-
tiev and Roth, 2006; Tao et al., 2006; Sproat et

al., 2006; Kim et al., 2012). T is computed us-
ing frequency vectors for entities and combined
with PH (Klementiev and Roth, 2006; Tao et al.,
2006). (Sproat et al., 2006) extend Taos approach
by iteratively updating overall similarities using R.
(Kim et al., 2012) holistically combine all the fea-
tures: PH, CX, T, and R.
However, T used in previous approaches is a
good feature only if temporal behaviors are sym-
metric across corpora. In contrast, Figure 1 il-
lustrates asymmetry, by showing the frequencies
of Usain Bolt, a Jamaican sprinter, and Hillary
Clinton, an American politician, in comparable
news articles during the year 2008. The former is
mostly mentioned in the context of some temporal
events, e.g., Beijing Olympics, while the latter is
not. In such case, as Hillary Clinton is a famous fe-
male leader, she may be associated with other Chi-
nese female leaders in Chinese corpus, while such
association is rarely observed in English corpus,
which causes asymmetry. That is, Hillary Clin-
ton is atemporal, as Figure 1(b) shows, such that
using such dissimilarity against deciding this pair
as a correct translation would be harmful. In clear
contrast, for Usain Bolt, similarity of temporal dis-

\x0ctributions in Figure 1(a) is a good feature for con-
cluding this pair as a correct one.
To overcome such problems, we propose a new
notion of selective temporality (called this fea-
ture ST to distinguish from T) to automatically
distinguish temporal and atemporal entities. To-
ward this goal, we design a classifier to distinguish
temporal entities from atemporal entities, based
on which we align temporal projections of entity
graphs for the temporal ones and the entire entity
graphs for the atemporal ones. We also propose
a method to identify the optimal window size for
temporal entities. We validate this selective use
of temporal features boosts the accuracy by 6.1%.

2 Preliminaries
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.99393">
Our approach follows a graph alignment frame-
work proposed in (You et al., 2010). Our graph
alignment framework consists of 4 steps.
</bodyText>
<subsectionHeader confidence="0.982853">
2.1 Step 1: Graph Construction
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.9990858">
We first build a graph G = (V, E) from each lan-
guage corpus, where V is a set of entities (nodes)
and E is a set of co-occurrence relationships (un-
weighted edges) between entities. We consider en-
tities occurring more than times as nodes and en-
tity pairs co-occurring more than times as edges.
To identify entities, we use a CRF-based named
entity tagger (Finkel et al., 2005) and a Chinese
word breaker (Gao et al., 2003) for English and
Chinese corpora, respectively.
</bodyText>
<subsectionHeader confidence="0.996744">
2.2 Step 2: Initialization
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.9984285">
Given two graphs Ge = (Ve, Ee) and Gc =
(Vc, Ec), we initialize |Ve|-by-|Vc |initial similar-
ity matrix R0 using PH and CX for every pair
(e, c) where e Ve and c Vc.
For PH, we use a variant of Edit-Distance (You
et al., 2010) between English entity and a ro-
manized representation of Chinese entity called
Pinyin. For CX, the context similarity is computed
based on entity context which is defined as a set of
words near to the entity (we ignore some words
such as stop words and other entities). We com-
pute similarity of the most frequent 20 words for
each entity using a variant of Jaccard index. To in-
tegrate two similarity scores, we adopt an average
as a composite function.
We finally compute initial similarity scores for
all pairs (e, c) where e Ve and c Vc, and build
the initial similarity matrix R0.
</bodyText>
<subsectionHeader confidence="0.984342">
2.3 Step 3: Reinforcement
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.822142">
We reinforce R0 by leveraging R and obtain a con-
verged matrix R using the following model:
</bodyText>
<equation confidence="0.907675714285714">

is the coefficient for balancing two terms.
However, as we cannot assure the correctly
matched neighbors (u, v), a chicken-and-egg
dilemma, we take advantage of the current simi-
larity Rt to estimate the next similarity Rt+1. Al-
gorithm 1 describes the process of matching the
neighbors where N(i) and N(j) are the sets of
neighbor nodes of i Ve and j Vc, respectively,
and H is a priority queue sorting the matched pairs
in non-increasing order of similarities. To guaran-
tee that the neighbors are correctly matched, we
use only the matches such that Rt

2.4 Step 4: Extraction
From R, we finally extract one-to-one matches
by using simple greedy approach of three steps:
(1) choosing the pair with the highest similarity
score; (2) removing the corresponding row and
column from R; (3) repeating (1) and (2) until
the matching score is not less than a threshold .
3 Entity Translation Discovery using
Selective Temporality
Overall Framework: We propose our framework
by putting together two separate procedures for
temporal and atemporal entities to compute the
overall similarity matrix R
</listItem>

<bodyText confidence="0.95948485">
\x0cWe first build two temporal graphs from the cor-
pora within every time window, optimized in Sec-
tion 3.1. We then compute the reinforced matrix
R
s obtained from the window starting at the time-
stamp s. To keep the best match scores among
all windows, we update R using the best similar-
ity among s, R
s . we then extract the candidate
translation pairs Mours by running step 4.
As there can exist atemporal entities in Mours,
we classify them (Section 3.2). Specifically, we
build two entire graphs and compute R. We then
distinguish temporal entities from atemporal ones
using our proposed metric for each matched pair
(i, j) Mours and, if the pair is atemporal, R(i,j)
is updated as the atemporal similarity R
(i,j).
From the final matrix R, we extract the matched
pairs by running step 4 with R once again.

3.1 Projecting Graph for Temporal Entities
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.989168952380952">
We first project graphs temporally to improve
translation quality for temporal entities. As the
optimal projection would differ across entities, we
generate many projected graphs by shifting time
window over all periods, and then identify the best
window for each entity.
The rest of this section describes how we set
the right window size w. Though each entity may
have its own optimal w, we find optimizing for
each entity may negatively influence on consider-
ing relationships with entities of different window
sizes. Thus, we instead find the optimal window
size w to maximize the global symmetry of the
given two graphs.
We now define symmetry with respect to the
truth translation pair M. We note it is infeasi-
ble to assume we have M during translation, and
will later relax to consider how M can be approx-
imated.
Given a set of graph pairs segmented by the
shifted windows

<bodyText confidence="0.588840333333333">
where s is the time-stamp, our goal is to find the
window size w maximizing the average symmetry

</equation>
<bodyText confidence="0.918029666666667">
Given M, symmetry S can be defined for (1)
node and (2) edge respectively. We first define the
node symmetry Sn as follows:
</bodyText>
<equation confidence="0.95173325">
Sn(Ge, Gc; M) =
(e,c)VeVc
I(e, c; M)
max{|Ve|, |Vc|}
</equation>
<bodyText confidence="0.951684">
where I(u, v; M) to be 1 if (u, v) M, 0 other-
wise. High node symmetry leads to accurate trans-
lation in R0 (Initialization step). Similarly, we de-
fine the edge symmetry Se as follows:
</bodyText>
<equation confidence="0.9535776">
Se(Ge, Gc; M) =
(e1,e2)Ee
(c1,c2)Ec
I(e1, c1; M)I(e2, c2; M)
max{|Ee|, |Ec|}
</equation>
<bodyText confidence="0.9985118">
In contrast, high edge symmetry leads to accurate
translation in R (Reinforcement step).
We finally define the symmetry S as the
weighted sum of Sn and Se with parameter (em-
pirically tuned to 0.8 in our experiment).
</bodyText>
<equation confidence="0.9354495">
S(Ge, Gc; M) =
Sn(Ge, Gc; M) + (1 )Se(Ge, Gc; M)
</equation>
<bodyText confidence="0.973829866666667">
However, as it is infeasible to assume we have
the truth translation pair M, we approximate M
using intermediate translation results Mours com-
puted at step 4. To insert only true positive pairs in
Mours, we set threshold higher than the optimized
value from the step 4. We found out that symmetry
from Mours closely estimates that from M:
S(Ge, Gc; M) S(Ge, Gc; Mours)
Specifically, observe from Table 1 that, given a
manually built ground-truth set Mg M as de-
scribed in Section 4.1, S(Ge, Gc; Mours) returns
the best symmetry value in two weeks for person
entities, which is expectedly the same as the result
of S(Ge, Gc; Mg). This suggests that we can use
Mours for optimizing window size.

3.2 Building Classifier
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999486666666667">
We then classify temporal/atemporal entities. As
a first step, we observe their characteristics: Tem-
poral entities have peaks in the frequency distri-
bution of both corpora and these peaks are aligned,
while such distribution of atemporal entities are
more uniform and less aligned.
</bodyText>
<page confidence="0.988294">

<bodyText confidence="0.994393347826087">
\x0cBased on these observations, we identify the
following criteria for temporal entities: (1) Their
two distributions m in English corpus and n in
Chinese corpus should have aligned peaks. (2)
Frequencies at the peaks are the higher the better.
For the first criterion, we first normalize the two
vectors m and n since two corpora have different
scales, i.e., different number of documents. We
then calculate the inner product of the two vectors
x = m, n, such that this aggregated distribution
x peaks, only if both m and n peak at the same
time.
For the second criterion, we have a spectrum
of option from taking the frequencies at all peaks
in one extreme, to taking only the maximum fre-
quency in another extreme. A metric representing
such a spectrum is p-norm, which represents sum
when p = 1 and maximum when p = . We em-
pirically tune the right balance to distinguish tem-
poral and atemporal entities, which turns out to be
p = 2.2.
Overall, we define a metric d(m, n) which sat-
isfies both criteria as follow:

<equation confidence="0.773615">
d(m, n) =

For instance, this measure returns 0.50 and 0.03
for the distributions in Figure 1(a) and (b), respec-
tively, from which we can determine the transla-
tion of Figure 1(a) is temporal and the one of Fig-
ure 1(b) is atemporal.

4.1 Experimental Settings

<bodyText confidence="0.974737888888889">
We obtained comparable corpora from English
and Chinese Gigaword Corpora (LDC2009T13
and LDC2009T27) published by the Xinhua News
Agency during the year 2008. From them, we ex-
tracted person entities and built two graphs, Ge =
(Ve, Ee) and Gc = (Vc, Ec) by setting = 20
which was used in (Kim et al., 2011).
Next, we built a ground truth translation pair
set Mg for person entities. We first selected 500
person names randomly from English corpus. We
then hired a Chinese annotator to translate them
into their Chinese names. Among them, only 201
person names were matched to our Chinese cor-
pus. We used all such pairs to identify the best
parameters and compute the evaluation measures.
We implemented and compared the following
approaches denoted as the naming convention of
listing of the used features in a parenthesis ():
(PH+R) in (You et al., 2010).
(PH+CX+R) in (Kim et al., 2011).
(PH+CX+R+T) in (Kim et al., 2012).
(PH+CX+R+ST): This is our approach.
We evaluated the effectiveness of our new ap-
proach using four measures: MRR, precision, re-
call, and F1-score, where MRR (Voorhees, 2001)
is the average of the reciprocal ranks of the query
results defined as follows:

where Q is a set of ground-truth matched pairs
(u, v) such that u Ve and v Vc, and rank(u,v)
is the rank of R(u,v) among all R(u,w)s such that
w Vc. We performed a 5-fold cross validation
by dividing ground truth into five groups. We used
four groups to training the parameters to maximize
F1-scores, used the remaining group as a test-set
using trained parameters, and computed average
of five results. (bold numbers indicate the best
performance for each metric.)

<abstract confidence="0.9914441">This paper studies named entity translation and proposes selective temporality as a new feature, as using temporal features may be harmful for translating atemporal entities. Our key contribution is building an automatic classifier to distinguish temporal and atemporal entities then align them in separate procedures to boost translation accuracy by 6.1%.</abstract>

As many new named entities appear every day in newspapers and web sites, their translations are non-trivial yet essential. Early efforts of named entity translation have focused on using phonetic feature (called PH) to estimate a phonetic similarity between two names (Knight and Graehl, 1998; Li et al., 2004; Virga and Khudanpur, 2003). In contrast, some approaches have focused on using context feature (called CX) which compares surrounding words of entities (Fung and Yee, 1998; Diab and Finch, 2000; Laroche and Langlais, 2010). Recently, holistic approaches combining such similarities have been studied (Shao and Ng, 2004; You et al., 2010; Kim et al., 2011).

We performed a 5-fold cross validation by dividing ground truth into five groups. We used four groups to training the parameters to maximize F1-scores, used the remaining group as a test-set using trained parameters, and computed average of five results.

Toward this goal, we design a classifier to distinguish temporal entities from atemporal entities, based on which we align temporal projections of entity graphs for the temporal ones and the entire entity graphs for the atemporal ones. We also propose a method to identify the optimal window size for temporal entities. We validate this selective use of temporal features boosts the accuracy by 6.1%. 2 Preliminaries Our approach follows a graph alignment framework proposed in (You et al., 2010). Our graph alignment framework consists of 4 steps. 2.1 Step 1: Graph Construction We first build a graph G = (V, E) from each language corpus, where V is a set of entities (nodes) and E is a set of co-occurrence relationships (unweighted edges) between entities. We consider entities occurring more than times as nodes and entity pairs co-occurring more than times as edges. To identify entities, we use a CRF-based named entity tagger (Finkel et al., 2005) and a Chinese word breaker (Gao et al., 2003) for English and Chinese corpora, respectively. 2.2 Step 2: Initialization Given two graphs Ge </context>

Next, we built a ground truth translation pair set Mg for person entities. We first selected 500 person names randomly from English corpus. We then hired a Chinese annotator to translate them into their Chinese names. Among them, only 201 person names were matched to our Chinese corpus. We used all such pairs to identify the best parameters and compute the evaluation measures.
