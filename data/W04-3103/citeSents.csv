Each abstract set was prepared for annotation as follows: the order of the abstracts was randomized and the abstracts were broken into sentences using Mxterminator CITATION,,
The two problems most commonly used in replication studies (e.g., CITATION) are their discovery of a link between Raynauds di,,
CITATION,,
We have started this process by considering CITATION and CITATION,,
The most comprehensive replication to date is CITATION which employs eight Swanson and Smalheiser discoveries as a test bed,,
Previous work along these lines includes CITATION,,
The two problems most commonly used in replication studies (e.g., CITATION) are their discovery of a link between Raynauds disease and fish oils CITATION and their discovery of several links between migraine and magnesium CITATION,,
The following people performed the annotations: Padmini Srinivasan, who has analyzed crohns and turmeric documents for a separate knowledge discover research task, Xin Ying Qiu, who is completely new to all three topics, Marc Light, who has some experience with gene regulation texts (e.g., CITATION), Vladimir Leontiev, who is a research scientist in an anatomy and cell biology department,,
The first table contains values for the kappa statistic of agreement (see CITATION) for the gene regulation data (set a) and the crohns data (set c),,
There has been recent work on classifying sentences from MEDLINE abstracts for the categories such as object, background, conclusions CITATION,,
For example, CITATION discusses uncertainty and hedging in radiology reports and their system assigns one of five levels of certainty to extracted findings,,
such as object, background, conclusions CITATION,,
