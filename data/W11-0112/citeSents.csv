It builds on the C&C CCG parser CITATION,,
CITATION describe a system for Recognizing Textual Entailment (RTE) that uses Boxer to convert both the premise and hypothesis of an RTE pair into first-order logical semantic representations and then uses a theorem prover to check for logical entailment,,
Distributional models describe the meaning of a word through the context in which it appears (CITATION; CITATION), where contexts can be documents, other words, or snippets of syntactic structure,,
Note that when running an example in the theorem prover, weights are not possible, so any rule that would be weighted in an MLN is simply treated as a hard clause following CITATION,,
