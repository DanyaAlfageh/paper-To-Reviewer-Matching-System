Finally, we use the exemplar-based distributional model of CITATION to produce rule weights,,
CITATION describe a system for Recognizing Textual Entailment (RTE) that uses Boxer to convert both the premise and hypothesis of an RTE pair into first-order logical semantic representations and then uses a theorem prover to check for logical entailment,,
Distributional models describe the meaning of a word through the context in which it appears (CITATION; CITATION), where contexts can be documents, other words, or snippets of syntactic structure,,
This has been done by representing the word meaning in context as a point in a high-dimensional semantics space (CITATION; CITATION; CITATION),,
Boxer CITATION is a software package for wide-coverage semantic analysis that provides semantic representations in the form of Discourse Representation Structures CITATION,,
Note that when running an example in the theorem prover, weights are not possible, so any rule that would be weighted in an MLN is simply treated as a hard clause following CITATION,,
It builds on the C&C CCG parser CITATION,,
We use Boxer CITATION to parse natural 105 \x0clanguage into a logical form,,
They, therefore, tend to have high precision at the cost of low recall CITATION,,
We use Alchemy CITATION for MLN inference,,
