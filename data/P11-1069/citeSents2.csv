lding on the initial work of CITATION and CITATION,,
Following recent work applying global discriminative models to large-scale structured prediction problems (CITATION; CITATION; CITATION; Finkel et al., 2008), we build our shift-reduce parser using a global linear model, and compare it with the chartbased C&C parser,,
5 Model and Training We use a global linear model to score candidate items, trained discriminatively with the averaged perceptron CITATION,,
In addition, high accuracy can be maintained by using a model which utilises a rich set of features for making each local decision CITATION,,
Hence our work shows that 683 \x0ctransition-based parsing can be successfully applied to CCG, improving on earlier attempts such as CITATION,,
Following CITATION, we apply the early update strategy to perceptron training: at any step during decoding, if neither the candidate output nor any item in the agenda is correct, decoding is stopped and the parameters are updated using the current highest scored item in the agenda or the candidate output, whichever has the higher score,,
