Shift-reduce parsers have become popular for dependency parsing, building on the initial work of CITATION and N,,
Unlike the C&C parser, the shift-reduce parser naturally produces fragmentary analyses when appropriate CITATION, and can produce sensible local structures even when a full spanning analysis cannot be found.1 Finally, considering this work in the wider parsing context, it provides an interesting comparison between heuristic beam search using a rich set of features, and optimal dynamic programming search where the feature range is restricted,,
From a parsing perspective, the C&C parser CITATION has been shown to be competitive with state-of-theart statistical parsers on a variety of test suites, including those consisting of grammatical relations CITATION, Penn Treebank phrasestructure trees CITATION, and unbounded dependencies CITATION,,

lding on the initial work of CITATION and CITATION,,
We follow CITATION and characterize the errors of the two parsers by sentence and dependency length and dependency type,,
Following CITATION, we assume that each input word has been assigned a POS-tag (from the Penn Treebank tagset) and a set of CCG lexical categories,,
The binary branching nature of CCG means that it is naturally compatible with bottom-up parsing algorithms such as shift-reduce and CKY (CITATION; CITATION),,
Hence our work shows that 683 \x0ctransition-based parsing can be successfully applied to CCG, improving on earlier attempts such as CITATION,,
CITATION demonstrate that the second extraction method results in a context-free approximation to the grammar resulting from the first 2 Although the C&C default mode applies a restriction for efficiency reasons in which only rule instances seen in CCGbank can be applied, making the grammar of the second type,,
prediction problems (CITATION; CITATION; CITATION; Finkel et al., 2008), we build our shift-reduce parser using a global linear model, and compare it with the chartbased C&C parser,,
However, the parsing work by CITATION, and also CITATION and CITATION, has only considered chart-parsing,,
The numbers for the normal-form model are evaluated by running the publicly available parser, while those for the hybrid dependency model are from CITATION,,
Finally, our work is similar to the comparison of the chart-based MSTParser CITATION and shift-reduce MaltParser CITATION for dependency parsing,,

 we use a global model rather than local models chained together; and finally, our results surpass the best published results on the CCG parsing task, whereas CITATIONa) matched the best PTB results only by using a parser combination,,
In addition, high accuracy can be maintained by using a model which utilises a rich set of features for making each local decision CITATION,,

4 Decoding Greedy local search (CITATION; CITATION; CITATION) has typically been used for decoding in shift-reduce parsers, while beam-search has recently been applied as an alternative to reduce error-propagation (CITATION; CITATION; CITATION; CITATION),,
CITATION describes similar work to ours but using an automatically-extracted HPSG, rather than CCG, gra,,
Following CITATION, we apply the early update strategy to perceptron training: at any step during decoding, if neither the candidate output nor any item in the agenda is correct, decoding is stopped and the parameters are updated using the current highest scored item in the agenda or the candidate output, whichever has the higher score,,

The resource used for building wide-coverage CCG parsers of English is CCGbank CITATION, a version of the Penn Treebank in which each phrase-structure tree has been transformed into a normal-form CCG derivation,,
However, the parsing work by CITATION, and ,,
The numbers for C&C are for the hybrid model, copied from CITATION,,
However, it is important to note that the advantages of CCG, in particular the tight relationship between syntax and semantic interpretation, are still maintained with the second approach, as CITATION argue,,
Following CITATION, we assume that each input word has been assigned a POS-tag (from the Penn Treebank tagset) and a set of CCG lexical ca,,

The last two rows in the table show the accuracies of CITATION (F&P), who applied the CFG parser of CITATION to CCG, and the corresponding accuracies for the C&C parser on the same test sentences,,
One difference is that CITATION use an approximating CFG, in addition to the supertagger, to improve the efficiency of the parser,,
 (2003) and CITATION,,
5 Model and Training We use a global linear model to score candidate items, trained discriminatively with the averaged perceptron CITATION,,
Differences with our approach are that we use a beam, rather than best-first, search; we use a global model rather than local models chained together; and finally, our results surpass the best published results on the CCG parsing task, whereas CITATIONa) matched the best PTB results only by using a parser combination,,
690 \x0cCITATION (and CITATION) describe a greedy shift-reduce parser for HPSG, in which a single action is chosen at each parsing step, allowing the possibility of highly efficient parsing,,
A key difference with previous work on shiftreduce dependency CITATION and CFG (CITATIONb) parsing is that, for CCG, there are many more shift actions a shift action for each word-lexical category pair,,
Our approach to this problem was to allow the parser to return a fragmentary analysis; CITATION adopt a different approach based on default unification,,
The comparison reported in this section is similar to the comparison between the chartbased MSTParser CITATION and shiftreduce MaltParser CITATION for dependency parsing,,
2 CCG Parsing CCG, and the application of CCG to wide-coverage parsing, is described in detail elsewhere (CITATION; CITATION; CITATION),,

6 Experiments Our experiments were performed using CCGBank CITATION, which was split into three subsets for training (Sections 0221), development testing (Section 00) and the final test (Section 23),,
applied to a range of problems in NLP, including treebank creation CITATION, syntactic parsing (CITATION; CITATION), logical form construction CITATION and surface realization CITATION,,
We ran the C&C parser using the normal-form model (we reproduced the numbers reported in CITATION), and copied the results of the hybrid model from CITATION, since the hybrid model is not part of the public release,,
