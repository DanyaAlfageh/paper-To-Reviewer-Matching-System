Our statistical algorithms are trained on a hand-labeled dataset: the FrameNet database CITATION,,
More recently, a domain independent system has been trained on general function tags such as Manner and Temporal by CITATION,,
5.2 Lexical Clustering In order to address the sparse coverage of lexical head word statistics, an experiment was carried out using an automatic clustering of head words of the type described in CITATION,,
A soft clustering of nouns was performed by applying the co-occurrence model of CITATION to a large corpus of observed direct object relationships between verbs and nouns,,
The clustering was computed from an automatically parsed version of the British National Corpus, using the parser of CITATION,,
The system is trained by \x0crst using the Collins parser CITATION to parse the 36,995 training sentences, matching annotated frame elements to parse constituents, and extracting various features from the string of words and the parse tree,,
De\x0cning semantic roles at the frame level avoids some of the di\x0eculties of attempting to \x0cnd a small set of universal, abstract thematic roles, or case roles such as Agent, Patient, etc (as in, among many others, CITATION (Jackendo\x0b, 1972)),,
"Abstract thematic roles can be thought of as being frame elements de\x0cned in abstract frames such as \\action"" and \\motion"" which are at the top of in inheritance hierarchy of semantic frames CITATION,,"

Frames are de\x0cned as schematic representations of situations involving various participants, props, and other conceptual roles CITATION,,
"For example, CITATION and others have shown that the di\x0berent syntactic subcatgorization frames of a verb like \\serve"" can be used to help disambiguate a particular instance of the word \\serve"",,"
Semantic roles could also act as an important intermediate representation in statistical machine translation or automatic text summarization and in the emerging \x0celd of Text Data Mining (TDM) CITATION,,

ons of uni\x0ccation-based grammars such as HPSG CITATION, rely on handdeveloped grammars which must anticipate each way in which semantic roles may be realized syntactically,,
"For example, in the context of the Air Traveler Information System (ATIS) for spoken dialogue, CITATION computed the probability that a constituent such as \\Atlanta"" \x0clled a semantic slot such as Destination in a semantic frame for air travel,,"
Traditional parsing and understanding systems, including implementations of uni\x0ccation-based grammars such as HPSG CITATION, rely on handdeveloped grammars which must anticipate each way in which semantic roles may be realized syntactically,,
For example, in the context of the Air Traveler Information System (ATIS) for spoken dialogue, CITATION computed the probability that a constituent such as,,
