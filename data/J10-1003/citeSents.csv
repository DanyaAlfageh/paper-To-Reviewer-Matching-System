2005), dialogues CITATION, evaluative text (Carenini, Ng, and Pauls 2006), and biomedical documents (Reeve, Han, and Brooks 2007),,
In order to handle have-clauses, our system contains an implementation of an approach proposed by CITATIONa),,
Example 2b is referred to as a serial situation (Huddleston and CITATION, page 123),,
Much of that line of research relied on an assumption that stories exhibit global cognitive structure (known as macrostructure [van Dijk 1980] or schema [CITATION]) and that they can be decomposed into a finite number of cognitive units,,

It is also commonly accepted (CITATION; Huddleston and CITATION, page 119) that stative clauses cannot be realized using progressive tenses (see Examples 4a and 4b),,
13 We decided against using deeper approaches, such as the Pyramid method CITATION, factoids (van Halteren and Teufel 2003), and relative utility CITATION,,
hat several researchers have looked into automatically determining various semantic properties of verbs (CITATIONb; CITATION),,
The relation between the lexical aspect of a verb and the aspect of a clause has been discussed by CITATION, CITATION, and Huddleston and CITATION, pages 118123),,
CITATION and CITATION attempted to circumvent this problem by learning to recognize more general structures,,

They fall well below the 0.8 cut-off point specified by CITATION,,
We derive this information from a manually compiled database of Lexical Conceptual Structures CITATION, which contains these properties for 4,432 English verbs,,
The interest in such mentions is inspired by the fact that these constructionsappositionsoften introduce new entities into the discourse CITATION,,
After a period of oblivion, these ideas regained popularity: van Dijk and Kintsch (1978) demonstrated the existence of macrostructures and their role in story comprehension and recall; Rumelhart CITATION, Thorndyke CITATION, and Ma,,
Events are processes that go on in time and consist of successive phases (CITATION, page 99),,

This is not unexpected because resolving noun phrase anaphora is known to be a very challenging task CITATION,,
When summarizing dialogues, CITATION, page 479) reports weighted accuracy of 0.614 compared to the lead baselines performance of 0.438 (the numbers are averages over five different summary sizes of 5%, 10%, 15%, 20%, and 25%),,
In this paper, the term aspect denotes the same concept as what Huddleston and CITATION, page 118) call the situation type,,
For example, a system called BORIS CITATION processed stories word-by-word to create a very rich ,,

It is also commonly accepted (CITATION; Huddleston and CITATION, page 119) that stative clauses cannot be realized using progressive tenses ,,
Three features characterize each template: the type of the temporal expression (location, duration, frequency, or enactment) CITATION; magnitude (year, day, etc.); and plurality (year vs,,
As many have remarked on previous occasions (CITATION; Radev et al,,
This direction was pioneered in 1928 by Vladimir CITATION with his detailed analysis of 100 Russian folk tales,,

LCS refers to the database of Lexical Conceptual Structures CITATION,,
For example, CITATION, page 214) reports achieving F-score of 76.04 when creating summaries of newswire articles at 10% of their original length,,
The first procedure employs machine learning techniques, namely the C5.0 decision tree induction CITATION,,
Usually, clauses in passive voice only occur with events (CITATIONb, page 51),,

5.3 Experiments with Machine Learning As an alternative to rule construction, in the second set of experiments we performed decision tree induction with C5.0 CITATION to select salient descriptive sentences,,
CITATIONa) used WordNet 1.6, whereas we work with a newer version, WordNet 2.0,,
We estimate the agreement using Scotts CITATION.15 This coefficient measures the observed agreement between judges corrected for chance agreement,,
These techniques included classification costs, undersampling (randomly removing instances of the majority class), oversampling (randomly duplicating instances of the minority class), and synthetic example generation CITATION,,
The solution relies on WordNet CITATION and contains a set of rules that determine the aspectual type of a have-clause based on the top WordNet category of the direct object,,

Many of these relied on a set of manually encoded schemas and chose the most appropriate one for a given story (CITATION; CITATION; CITATION),,
The third part of the evaluation uses two ROUGE metrics CITATION to compare the machine-made and the baseline summaries with the model abstracts,,
In addition, more researchers have been venturing past purely extractive summarization (Krahmer, Marsi, and van Pelt 2008; CITATION; CITATION),,
The third evaluation experiment compared the machine-made and the baseline summaries with the manually created abstracts using ROUGE CITATIONa package for automatically evaluating summaries,,
This finding was also reflected in the approach proposed by CITATION,,
