We present an approach to the automatic creation of extractive summaries of literary short
stories. The summaries are produced with a specific objective in mind: to help a reader decide
whether she would be interested in reading the complete story. To this end, the summaries give
the user relevant information about the setting of the story without revealing its plot. The system
relies on assorted surface indicators about clauses in the short story, the most important of which
are those related to the aspectual type of a clause and to the main entities in a story. Fifteen judges
evaluated the summaries on a number of extrinsic and intrinsic measures. The outcome of this
evaluation suggests that the summaries are helpful in achieving the original objective.

<bodyText confidence="0.916411090909091">
In the last decade, automatic text summarization has become a popular research topic
with a curiously restricted scope of applications. A few innovative research directions
have emerged, including headline generation (Soricut and Marcu 2007), summarization
of books (Mihalcea and Ceylan 2007), personalized summarization (Daz and Gervas
2007), generation of tables-of-contents (Branavan, Deshpande, and Barzilay 2007), sum-
marization of speech (Fuentes et al. 2005), dialogues (Zechner 2002), evaluative text
(Carenini, Ng, and Pauls 2006), and biomedical documents (Reeve, Han, and Brooks
2007). In addition, more researchers have been venturing past purely extractive sum-
marization (Krahmer, Marsi, and van Pelt 2008; Nomoto 2007; McDonald 2006). By
and large, however, most research in text summarization still revolves around texts
characterized by rigid structure. The better explored among such texts are news articles
(Barzilay and McKeown 2005), medical documents (Elhadad et al. 2005), legal docu-
ments (Moens 2007), and papers in the area of computer science (Teufel and Moens
2002; Mei and Zhai 2008). Although summarizing these genres is a formidable challenge
in itself, it excludes a continually increasing number of informal documents available
electronically. Such documents, ranging from novels to personal Web pages, offer a
wealth of information that merits the attention of the text summarization community.

We attempt to make a step in this direction by devising an approach to summarizing a
relatively unexplored genre: literary short stories.
Well-structured documents, such as news articles, exhibit a number of character-
istics that help identify some of the important passages without performing in-depth
semantic analysis. These characteristics include predictable location of typical items in
a document and in its well-delineated parts, cue words, and template-like structure
that often characterizes a genre (e.g., scientific papers). This is not the case in literature.
Quite the contraryto write fiction in accordance with a template is a sure way to write
poor prose. One also cannot expect to find portions of text that summarize the main
idea behind a story, and even less so to find them in the same location. In addition, the
variety of literary devices (the widespread use of metaphor and figurative language,
leaving things unsaid and relying on the readers skill of reading between the lines,
frequent use of dialogue, etc.) makes summarizing fiction a very distinct task. It is
a contribution of this work to demonstrate that summarizing short fiction is feasible
using state-of-the-art tools in natural language technology. In the case of our corpus,
this is also done without deep semantic resources or knowledge bases, although such
resources would be of great help. We leverage syntactic information and shallow se-
mantics (provided by a gazetteer) to produce indicative summaries of short stories that
people find helpful and that outperform naive baselines and two state-of-the-art generic
summarizers.
We have restricted the scope of this potentially vast project in several ways. In
the course of this work we concentrate on producing summaries of short stories suit-
able for a particular purpose: to help a reader form adequate expectations about the
complete story and decide whether she would be interested in reading it. To this end,
the summary includes important elements of the setting of a story, such as the place
and the main characters, presented as excerpts from the complete story. The assump-
tion behind this definition is this: If a reader knows when and where the story takes
place and who its main characters are, she should be able to make informed decisions
about it.
With such a definition of short story summaries, re-telling the plot in the summary
is not among the objectives of this work; in fact, doing so is undesirable. We have
introduced this limitation for two reasons. There is an ideological side of the decision:
Not many people want to know what happens in a story before reading it, even if this
may help them decide that the story is worth reading. There also is a practical side,
namely the complexity of the problem: Summarizing the plot would be considerably
more difficult (see Section 2 for a review of related work). We hope to tackle this
issue in the future. For now, creating indicative summaries of short stories is challenge
enough.
The summaries in Figures 13 illustrate our approach in the context of a naive
lead baseline and a ceiling. Figure 1 shows an example of an automatically produced
summary that meets the aforementioned criteria. A reader can see that the story is set in
a restaurant where the customers are tended to by two waitresses: the fair Aileen who
wins hearts and the-bag-o-meal plain-faced Tildy. If the reader chooses to pursue
the story, she will find the description of an accident of paramount importance to Tildy:
One day she is kissed by a customer in public! The event is more than flattering to
usually under-appreciated Tildy. It causes a complete change in how she views herself.
The story then unfolds to reveal that the customer was drunk on the day in question
and that he returned to apologize several days later. This apology is a severe blow to
Tildy and an abrupt end of many a dream that the incident had spurred in her head. The
story ends with Aileen trying to comfort her crying friend by saying He aint anything

of a gentleman or he wouldnt ever of apologized. Yet, the summary in Figure 1 does
not reveal these facts. For comparison, Figure 2 shows a summary obtained by taking
the same number of sentences from the beginning of the story. As the reader can see,
such a trivial approach is not sufficient to create a useful summary. Figure 3 shows a
manually created ideal summary.
We experimented with a corpus of 47 stories from the 19th and early 20th century
written by renowned writers, including O. Henry, Jerome K. Jerome, Anton Chekhov,
and Guy de Maupassant. The stories, with the exception of a few fairy tales, are clas-
sical examples of short social fiction. The corpus was collected from Project Gutenberg
(www.gutenberg.org) and only contains stories in English. The average length of a story
is 3,333 tokens and the target compression rate expressed in the number of sentences
is 94%.
In order to create summaries of short stories that satisfy our stated criteria (hence-
forth indicative summaries), the system searches each story for sentences that focus
on important entities and relate the background of the story (as opposed to events).
Correspondingly, processing has two stages. Initially, the summarizer identifies two
types of important entities: main characters and locations. This is achieved using a
gazetteer, resolving anaphoric expressions and then identifying frequently mentioned

entities. Next, the system selects sentences that set out the background of the story
and focus on one of the important entities. In order to separate the background of a
story from the plot (i.e., events), we rely on the notion of aspect.1
We approximate the
aspectual type of a clause using either machine learning or manually produced rules.
This is achieved by relying on an array of verb-related features, such as tense, lexical
aspect of the main verb, presence of temporal expressions, and so on. Finally, the system
composes a summary out of the selected sentences.
Our task remains a significant challenge despite its limited scope. To produce such
indicative summaries successfully, one needs to consider many facets of the problem.
An informative data representation, computational complexity, and usability of the final
product are only some of them. Because the project is at the stage of an advanced
feasibility study, it has not been possible to do justice to all aspects of the problem.
Therefore, we concentrated on several specific issues and left many more to future work
and to fellow researchers.
Firstly, we sought to identify characteristics of short stories that could be helpful in
creating summaries. We devised an informative and practical data representation that
could be reproduced without too much cost or effort. Secondly, we restricted ourselves
to identifying the most informative portions of the stories and paid much less attention
to readability and coherence of the resulting summaries. Even though readability is an
important property, we hypothesized that informativeness is yet more important. Once
the task of identifying informative passages has been accomplished, one can work on
achieving coherence and readability. In the end, the emphasis was on the creation of
extractive summaries using established tools and methods and on the identification of
genre-specific properties that can help summarization.
The novelty of the task and the absence of agreed-upon measures for evaluating
summaries of literary prose call for a thorough evaluation using a variety of metrics.
That is why we conduct three distinct evaluation experiments. The summaries are

we mean a characteristic of a clause that gives readers an idea about the temporal flow of an event or a
state described in it. For example, the aspectual type of the sentence He likes to run is a state. The aspectual
type of He has run a marathon is an event.

evaluated both extrinsically and intrinsically. They are also compared with two naive
baselines (lead and random) and two state-of-the-art summarization systems designed
for summarizing newswire (henceforth baseline summarizers).2
In the first experiment, 15 people read a mix of machine-made, random, and manual
summaries, and answer questions about them. Some questions are factual in nature
(e.g., list the main characters of the story), and others are subjective (e.g., rate the readability
of the summary). The results show that the machine-made summaries are significantly
better than the random baseline but they fall far short of the quality of the manual
summaries.
During the second evaluative experiment, the machine-made summaries are com-
pared against extracts created by people using sentence co-selection measures (pre-
cision, recall, and F-score). By sentence co-selection we mean measuring how many
sentences found in manually created extracts are selected for inclusion in automatically
produced summaries. The results suggest that our system outperforms all baselines,
including state-of-the-art summarizers.
The third part of the evaluation uses two ROUGE metrics (Lin 2004) to compare
the machine-made and the baseline summaries with the model abstracts. The results
suggest that these measures are not well suited for evaluating extractive indicative
summaries of short stories.
This paper is organized in the following manner. Section 2 gives a brief overview of
the body of research in automatic story comprehension. Section 3 describes the process
of identifying important entities in short stories. Section 4 introduces the notion of
aspect, gives an overview of the systems design, and discusses the linguistic motivation
behind it. Section 5 describes the classification procedures (the use of machine learning
and manual rule creation) that distinguish between the descriptive elements of a story
and the passages that describe events. Section 6 reports on the evaluation of summaries
which our system produces. Section 7 draws conclusions and outlines directions for
future work.

<bodyText confidence="0.924605125">
Summarization of literary prose is a relatively unexplored topic. There exists, however,
a substantial body of research tackling the problem of story comprehension. During
the 1970s and 1980s, a number of researchers in artificial intelligence built story-
understanding systems that relied in one way or another on contemporary research
in psychology and discourse processing.
Much of that line of research relied on an assumption that stories exhibit global
cognitive structure (known as macrostructure [van Dijk 1980] or schema [Bartlett 1932])
and that they can be decomposed into a finite number of cognitive units. According
to this view, diversity in stories is not due to an infinite number of plots, but to an
infinite number of combinations of a (relatively) small number of cognitive units. This
direction was pioneered in 1928 by Vladimir Propp (1968) with his detailed analysis of
100 Russian folk tales. After a period of oblivion, these ideas regained popularity: van
Dijk and Kintsch (1978) demonstrated the existence of macrostructures and their role
in story comprehension and recall; Rumelhart (1975), Thorndyke (1975), and Mandler
2 These systems are GISTexter (Harabagiu, Hickl, and Lacatusu 2007) and CLASSY (Schlesinger, OLeary,
and Conroy 2008; Conroy, Schlesinger, and OLeary 2007). See Section 6 for details.

(1987) developed sets of cognitive schemas (story grammars) that could be applied to
certain types of stories; and Lehnert (1982) proposed to represent action-based stories
in terms of a finite number of plot unitsconfigurations of affect (or emotional) states
of its characters.
The developments in psychology and discourse processing had gone hand in hand
with those in artificial intelligence and resulted in a score of story-understanding
and question-answering systems. Many of these relied on a set of manually encoded
schemas and chose the most appropriate one for a given story (Cullingford 1978; Dyer
1983; Leake 1989). For example, a system called BORIS (Dyer 1983) processed stories
word-by-word to create a very rich semantic representation of them using Memory
Organization Packets (MOPs) and Thematic Affect Units (TAUs). These knowledge
structures were activated by means of a very detailed lexicon where each lexeme was
associated with MOPs and TAUs it could invoke.
Systems such as BORIS could not process stories that did not conform to schemas
already at their disposal. Charniak and Goldman (1988) and Norvig (1989) at-
tempted to circumvent this problem by learning to recognize more general structures.
FAUSTUS (Norvig 1989) recognized six general classes of inferences by finding patterns
of connectivity in a semantic network. It could be adapted to new kinds of documents by
extending its knowledge base and not the underlying algorithm or patterns. Research in
automatic story comprehension offered a number of important solutions for subsequent
developments in artificial intelligence. No less important, it pointed out a number of
challenges. All these systems required a formidable amount of semantic knowledge and
a robust and efficient way of building a semantic representation of texts. In addition,
systems such as BORIS or SAM (Cullingford 1978) also needed a set of schemas or
schema-like scenarios. With such labor intensity, these requirements prohibit using
schema-based approaches for real-life stories (e.g., fiction) and only allow the processing
of artificially created examples.
In this historical context, our current approach to summarization of short fiction
appears rather modest: Our system does not understand stories, nor does it retell
their plot. Instead, it offers the reader hintsimportant information about the storys
settingwhich should help her guess what type of story is to come. This assumption
appears reasonable because it has been shown that comprehension and recall of dis-
course are strongly influenced by the readers familiarity with the type of schema (van
Dijk and Kintsch 1978). Because our system is tailored to work with classics of the genre,
it was our expectation that the gist of the storys setting offered to the reader in the
wording of the original would give her an idea about the storys themes and likely plot
developments. The results of our experiments appear to back this assumption.
In addition, given the original objective, it seems reasonable that elements other
than the plot would have a strong influence on the readers decision to read or not to
read the story. The setting of the story, its characters, and style are some of the important
factors. Many outstanding literary works differ not so much in plot as in their setting or
moral.3
Our system attempts to capture important elements of the setting explicitly and
we expect that some elements of style may be captured implicitly due to the extractive
nature of the summaries.
3 Consider, for example, Goethes Faust and Bulgakovs Master and Margarita. Although they both revolve
around the protagonist entering into a pact with the devilalbeit for different reasonsthe latter takes
place in Moscow around 1930s and the two works are dramatically different.

3. Identifying Important Entities
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.995599629629629">
During the first stage of summary production the system identifies important entities
in stories. Initially, we planned to identify three types of entities: people, locations, and
time stamps. During a preliminary exploration of the corpus, we analyzed 14 stories for
the presence of surface indicators of characters, locations, and temporal anchors.4
We
employed the GATE Gazetteer (Cunningham et al. 2002), and only considered entities
it recognized automatically.
The experiment revealed that the stories in the corpus contained multiple mentions
of characters (on average, 64 mentions per story, excluding pronouns). On the other
hand, the 14 stories contained only 22 location markers, mostly street names. Four
stories had no identifiable location markers. Finally, merely four temporal anchors
were identified in all 14 stories: two absolute (such as year) and two relative (e.g.,
Christmas). These findings support the intuitive idea that short stories revolve around
their characters, even if the ultimate goal is to show a larger social phenomenon. They
also suggest that looking for time stamps in short stories is unlikely to prove productive,
because such information is not included in these texts explicitly. That is why our system
does not attempt to identify them.
Because characters appear to be central to short stories, we designed our system
to maximize the amount of information available about them. It contains an anaphora
resolution module that resolves pronominal and noun phrase anaphoric references to
animate entities. The term anaphora, as used in this work, can be explained as a way
of mentioning a previously encountered entity without naming it explicitly. Consider
Examples 1a, 1b, and 1c from A Matter of Mean Elevation by O. Henry. The noun
phrase Mlle. Giraud from Example 1a is an antecedent and the pronouns her and she from
Example 1c are anaphoric expressions or referents. Example 1c illustrates pronominal
anaphora, and Example 1b illustrates noun phrase anaphora. Here the noun phrase
the woman is the anaphoric expression which refers to the antecedent Mlle. Giraud from

<bodyText confidence="0.998603909090909">
The anaphora resolution module only handles first and third person singular per-
sonal pronouns (I, me, my, he, his...) and singular definite noun phrases that denote
animate entities (e.g., the man, but not men). It is implemented in Java, within the GATE
framework, using the Connexor Machinese Syntax parser (Tapanainen and Jarvinen
1997).
The system resolves anaphoric expressions in the following manner. Initially, the
documents are parsed with the Connexor Machinese Syntax parser. The parsed data are
then forwarded to the Gazetteer in GATE, which recognizes nouns denoting locations
and persons. The original version of the Gazetteer only recognizes named entities and
professions, but we extended it to include 137 common animate nouns such as man,
woman, soldier, or baby. During the next stage, pronominal anaphoric expressions are

Subsequently, anaphoric noun phrases are identified using the rules outlined by
Vieira and Poesio (2000). Finally, anaphoric noun phrases are resolved using a modified
version of the Lappin and Leass algorithm, adjusted to finding antecedents of nouns.
The implementation is described in detail in Kazantseva (2006).
A thorough evaluation of the anaphora resolution module would be prohibitively
labor-intensive. We estimated the performance of the module by manually verifying
the results it achieved on two short stories of the training set (Table 1). The error rates
for pronominal anaphora resolution are significantly lower than those for noun phrase
anaphora resolution (15.07% vs. 36.84%). This is not unexpected because resolving noun
phrase anaphora is known to be a very challenging task (Vieira and Poesio 2000). The
results also reveal that referring to characters by pronouns is much more frequent
than by noun phrasesin our case, the ratio of pronominal to nominal expressions is
almost 4:1. This suggests that resolving pronominal anaphoric expressions is crucial to
summarizing short stories.
The GATE Gazetteer, part of this module, also annotates the stories for the pres-
ence of expressions denoting locations. After resolving anaphoric expressions, char-
acters central to each story are selected based on normalized frequency counts taking
anaphoric expressions into account. The output of this module consists of short stories
annotated for the presence of location markers and main character mentions.

We rely on aspect to select salient sentences that set out the background of a story. In
this paper, the term aspect denotes the same concept as what Huddleston and Pullum
(2002, page 118) call the situation type. The term refers to different ways of viewing
the internal temporal consistency of a situation (Comrie 1976, page 3). Informally, the
aspect of a clause suggests the temporal flow of an event or a state and the speakers
position with respect to it.

Aspectual hierarchy after Huddleston and Pullum (2002).
The first distinction is between states and events. Events are processes that go on in
time and consist of successive phases (Vendler 1967, page 99). For instance, an event of
writing an essay consists of writing separate words, correcting, pausing between words,
and so on. A state of understanding each other, on the other hand, does not imply such
compositionality: It remains unchanged throughout the whole period when it is true.
In other words, the meaning of events exhibits a dynamic component, whereas that of
states does not.
Events are further categorized by whether a particular situation lasts for some time
or occurs momentarily. The latter type of events are referred to as achievements, and
events that imply duration are known as processes. For example, the nature of events
such as dropping, stumbling, or recognizing is that they occur instantaneously and,
therefore, are achievements. On the other hand, events such as playing golf or writing
an essay last for some time, so they are processes.
Processes are classified into accomplishments and activities depending on whether
a situation implies an ending (Vendler 1967, page 100). This property is known as
telicity. Reading a book in the context of Example 2a implies that the person finished
reading it: the overall situation is telic. We cannot say that she has read the book in the
first 15 minutes of doing so because the implied ending was not achieved (i.e., the book
has not been read). Such situations are referred to as accomplishments. On the other
hand, playing golf or talking on the phone does not imply that the process must end
with a specific conclusion and the situation is atelic. Such situations are called activities.
In addition, the aspectual type of a clause may be altered by multiplicity, for exam-
ple, repetitions. Consider Examples 2a and 2b.
(2a) She read a book.
(2b) She read a book a day.
Example 2b is referred to as a serial situation (Huddleston and Pullum 2002, page 123).
It is considered to be a state, even though a single act of reading a book would constitute
an event.

Intuitively, stativeand especially serialsituations are more likely to be associ-
ated with descriptions, that is to say, with things that are, or things that were happening
for an extended period (consider He was a tall man vs. He opened the window). The
remainder of Section 4 describes how we identify single and serial stative clauses and
use them to construct summaries.

4.2 Overall System Design
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999827">
Several system components are responsible for selecting salient background sentences.
A story, annotated for the presence of important entities (as outlined in Section 3), is
parsed with the Connexor Machinese Syntax parser. The sentences are then recursively
split into clauses based on the results of parsing. For the purposes of this project, a
clause is defined as a main verb as identified by the parser (whether finite or non-finite)
with all its complements, including subject, modifiers, and their constituents.
Next, each clause is represented as a vector of features describing its characteristics.
The system offers a choice: a fine-grained or coarse-grained representation. The main
difference between the two is in the level of detail at which each clause is represented.
For instance, a fine-grained feature vector has three different features with seven possi-
ble values to carry tense-related information: tense, is progressive, and is perfect, whereas
a coarse-grained vector carries only one binary feature, is simple past or present.6
Finally, the system selects salient descriptive sentences. Regardless of the granular-
ity of the representation, one may choose between two different procedures for sentence
selection. The first procedure employs machine learning techniques, namely the C5.0
decision tree induction (Quinlan 1992). The second procedure applies a set of manually
created rules that guide the classification process. Section 4.3 gives a motivation for fea-
tures used in each data set. Sections 5.15.3 describe the experimental setting. Section 6
presents the results.
The part of the system that selects descriptive sentences is implemented in Python.

(Criterion 2) a clause should contain background descriptions rather then events
We hypothesize that sentences which satisfy both criteria are good candidates for inclu-
sion in indicative summaries. In other words, a summary that consists of such sentences
would familiarize the reader with important elements of the setting of the story, but
would not reveal the plot.
The features that contribute towards Criterion 1 can be divided into character-
related and location-related. We have designed character-related features to help iden-
tify sentences that focus on characters, not just mention them in passing. These features
are modeled so as to help identify sentences that contain at least one mention of an
important character with a salient grammatical function (e.g., subject). Location-related

features are intended to help identify sentences where named entities tagged as loca-
tions by the Gazetteer indeed refer to location names.
Criterion 2 has been introduced to ensure that the selected sentences are back-
ground sentences (as opposed to those relating events) and are therefore suitable for
inclusion in indicative summaries. To this end, the features that contribute towards
Criterion 2 are designed to identify stative clauses and clauses that describe serial situa-
tions. A single unambiguous indicator of aspectual type does not exist, but a number of
verb-related characteristics of the clause may signal or limit its possible aspectual type.
These characteristics include the lexical aspect of the main verb, tense, the presence of
temporal expressions, voice, and certain properties of the direct object. The verb-related
features capture this information in our representation.7
The remainder of this section contains a detailed description of the various types of
features and motivates their inclusion. Table 2 shows how many features contribute
to each criterion, and how many discrete values they have. Appendix A contains a
complete list of features used in both representations, explains how they are computed,
and shows the cardinality of the sets of possible values.
Character-related features. Character-related features help ensure that selected sen-
tences are about one of the important characters in the story. So, this group of features
describes whether a clause contains a character mention and what its grammatical
function is (subject, object, indirect object, or other). Mentions of characters early in the
text tend to contain more salient background information. That is why character-related
features reflect the position of a parent sentence8
relative to the sentence where the
character is introduced. In addition, these features capture the presence of a character
mention that is premodified by a noun phrase. The interest in such mentions is inspired
by the fact that these constructionsappositionsoften introduce new entities into the
discourse (Vieira and Poesio 2000). For the same reasons, the system also establishes
whether a character mention is nominal or pronominal (e.g., Jack vs. he), whether it is
used in the genitive case (e.g., Jacks) and, for common nouns, whether the mention is
accompanied by an indefinite article.
7 It must be mentioned that several researchers have looked into automatically determining various
semantic properties of verbs (Siegel 1998b; Merlo et al. 2002). These approaches, however, attempt to
determine properties of verbs viewed in isolation and do not deal with particular usages in the context of
concrete sentences. That is why we cannot directly re-apply that research in determining the aspectual
type of clauses.
8 By parent sentence we mean the sentence from which the clause is taken.

Location-related features. In discourse such as fiction, not all tokens that the
Gazetteer recognizes as markers of location denote locations. Location-related features
help identify mentions of locations in each clause and verify that these mentions indeed
denote a place. These features describe whether a clause contains a mention of a location
and whether it is embedded in a prepositional phrase. The rationale for these features is
that true location mentions are more likely to occur inside prepositional phrases, such
as from Chicago or to China.
Verb-related features. Verb-related features model the characteristics of a clause
that help determine its aspectual type.
Lexical aspect of a verb. Lexical aspect refers to a property of a verb when viewed
in isolation, without regard to the context provided by a particular clause. Just as for
clauses, a verb may be a state (or stative) verb (e.g., believe), or an event verb (e.g., run).
Event verbs are further subdivided into verbs of activity (e.g., read), accomplishment
(e.g., take a test), and achievement (e.g., drop).
The relation between the lexical aspect of a verb and the aspect of a clause has been
discussed by Vendler (1967), Dorr and Olsen (1997), and Huddleston and Pullum (2002,
pages 118123). Dorr and Olsen have proposed a privative model of this relationsee
Table 3. The model states that verbs are categorized into aspectual classes based on
whether they exhibit one or more of the following properties: dynamicity, durativity,
and telicity. Dorr and Olsen speculate that, depending on the context of usage, verbs
may form clauses that have more of these properties than the main verb viewed in
isolation, but that it is impossible for a verb to shed one of its properties. We illustrate
this in Examples 3a and 3b. In Example 3a the state verb know participates in an
accomplishment clause; the clause is telic, although the verb by itself is not. On the other
hand, an attempt to deprive the accomplishment verb destroy of its telic meaning when
constructing a clause of type activity fails to create an acceptable clause (Example 3b).
(3a) He knew it that very moment. (accomplishment)
(3b) *He was destroying it for an hour. (activity) 9
The lexical aspect of a verb influences the aspect of a clause. Several features in our
system capture this information. The fine-grained data set contains three features with
six possible values that show whether the main verb of a clause is durative, dynamic, or
telic. The coarse-grained data set contains a single feature with four possible values (the
lexical aspect of a verb according to the model in Table 3). We derive this information
from a manually compiled database of Lexical Conceptual Structures (Dorr and Olsen
1997), which contains these properties for 4,432 English verbs.

\x0cKazantseva and Szpakowicz Summarizing Short Stories
Grammatical tense. The grammatical tense used in a particular clause places a
number of constraints on its aspectual type. For instance, simple tenses are more
likely to be used in stative or habitual situations than progressive or perfect tenses.
It is also commonly accepted (Dowty 1979; Huddleston and Pullum 2002, page 119)
that stative clauses cannot be realized using progressive tenses (see Examples 4a and
4b). Huddleston and Pullum (2002, page 121) stipulate that it is also the case with
achievement clauses (see Example 4c).
</bodyText>
<listItem confidence="0.962748076923077">
(4a) John is running. (event, activity)
(4b) *John is knowing the answer. (state)
(4c) *John was recognizing her. (event, accomplishment)
Among the constraints that grammatical tense imposes there is the special relation
between simple present tense and event clauses. As a rule, clauses realized in simple
present tense cannot denote events, but only states (Huddleston and Pullum 2002,
page 119). The matter is illustrated in Examples 5a through 7b.
(5a) She knew history well. (state)
(5b) She knows history well. (state)
(6a) She fell off a chair. (event)
(6b) *She falls off a chair. (event)
(7a) She danced (last night). (event)
(7b) She dances. (state)
</listItem>
<bodyText confidence="0.9945259">
In the fine-grained data set the information related to tense is expressed using three
features with seven possible values (whether a clause is in present, past, or future tense;
whether it is progressive; and whether it is perfective). In the coarse-grained data set,
this information is expressed using one binary feature: whether a clause is in simple,
past, or present tense.
Temporal expressions. Temporal markers (often referred to as temporal adverbials),
such as usually, never, suddenly, at that moment, and many others, are widely employed
to mark the aspectual type of a sentence (Dowty 1979; Harkness 1987; By 2002). Such
markers provide a wealth of information and often unambiguously signal aspectual
type. For example:
</bodyText>
<listItem confidence="0.662743">
(8a) She read a lot tonight.
(8b) She always read a lot. (or She used to read a lot.)
</listItem>
<bodyText confidence="0.980026875">
Such expressions are not easy to capture automatically, however. In order to use the
information expressed in temporal adverbials, we analyzed the training part of the
corpus for the presence of such expressions. There were 295 occurrences in 10 stories.
It turns out that this set can be reduced to 95 templates. For example, the expressions
this year, next year, that long year can all be reduced to a template \x02some expression year\x03.
Possible values of \x02time expression\x03 are further restricted to allow only valid modifiers
(e.g., last, next, but not yellow). The system captures temporal expressions using a cas-
cade of regular expression. It first identifies the least ambiguous unit (in this example

year) and then attempts to find the boundaries of the expression. The complete list of
regular expressions used appears in Kazantseva (2006).
Three features characterize each template: the type of the temporal expression
(location, duration, frequency, or enactment) (Harkness 1987); magnitude (year, day,
etc.); and plurality (year vs. years). The fine-grained data set contains three such fea-
tures with 14 possible values (type of expression, its magnitude, and plurality). The
coarse-grained data set contains one binary feature (whether a clause contains an ex-
pression that denotes a long period of time).
Voice. Usually, clauses in passive voice only occur with events (Siegel 1998b,
page 51). Both data sets contain one binary feature that describes this information.
Properties of the direct object. For some verbs, properties of the direct object help

determine whether a given clause is stative or dynamic.
(9a) She wrote a book. (event)
(9b) She wrote books. (state)
</listItem>
<bodyText confidence="0.958266625">
It is of particular interest whether the direct object follows a definite or indefinite
determiner and whether it is used in a singular or plural form. Two binary features
that describe this information are included in the fine-grained data set.
Several additional features in both data sets describe the overall characteristics of
a clause and its parent sentence, such as whether these were affirmative statements,
exclamations, or questions; their index in the text; and a few others. The fine-grained
data set contains three such features with seven possible values. The coarse-grained
data set contains three features with four values.

Due to the high degree of ambiguity, our system handles clauses with have as the
main verb in a manner different from all other clauses. This machinery remains the
same regardless of what options are used for the granularity of representation and for
sentence selection procedures.
In order to handle have-clauses, our system contains an implementation of an ap-
proach proposed by Siegel (1998a). The solution relies on WordNet (Fellbaum 1998) and
contains a set of rules that determine the aspectual type of a have-clause based on the
top WordNet category of the direct object. For instance, the direct object lunch from
Example 11a belongs to the category food and, according to rules from Siegel (1998a),
the aspectual type of a clause is event. The direct object friend from Example 11b belongs
to the category person, so the aspectual type of the clause is state. Siegel (1998a) used

this newer ontology is different from that of version 1.6. For this reason, we consider
all parent categories in the hypernym tree, not only the top category. For the sake of
completeness, Figure 5 shows the pseudo-code for this procedure. The system judges a
have-clause to be summary-worthy if two conditions are fulfilled: the clause contains a
mention of one or more important characters and it is a state clause.

The final version of the summarizer proceeds as follows. First of all, the stories are
parsed with the Connexor parser and named entities are recognized using the GATE
Gazetteer. Then the system resolves anaphoric references and identifies important char-
acters and locations. During the next stage, the summarizer splits all source sentences
into clauses and creates coarse- and fine-grained representations for each clause. A
clause is modeled as a vector of character-, location- and verb-related features. Finally,
the system employs two alternative procedures to select summary-worthy sentences:
manually designed rules and machine learning.
We performed a number of experiments to find out how successful our system is
in creating summaries of short stories. The experimental corpus consisted of 47 short
stories split into a training set of 27 stories and a test set of 20 stories. The average length
of a story in the corpus was 3,333 tokens, 244 sentences, or approximately 4.5 U.S.-letter-
sized pages. The corpus contains stories written by 17 different authors. It was split
manually so that its training and test portions contained approximately an equal num-
ber of stories by the same writer. The first author of this paper annotated each clause of
every story for summary-worthiness and achieved the compression rate of 6%, counted
in sentences. This rate was the target compression rate in all further experiments.
The training data set consisted of 10,525 clauses, 506 of which were annotated as
summary-worthy and all others as not summary-worthy. The test data set contained
7,890 clauses, 406 of them summary-worthy.
We fine-tuned the system and used the training portion of the data set to iden-
tify the best settings. Then we ran two sets of experiments on the test portion. In the
first set of experiments, we applied a manually designed set of rules that select sen-
tences for possible inclusion in summaries. These experiments are described in Sec-
tion 5.2. The second set of experiments relied on using machine-learning techniques
to create summaries. It is described in Section 5.3. After the completion of the experi-
ments, the summaries were evaluated by six judges. They were also compared against

5.2 Experiments with Manually Designed Rules
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999769866666667">
The first classification procedure applies manually designed rules to a clause-level
representation of the original stories to produce descriptive summaries. The rules are
designed using the same features as those used for machine learning and described in
Section 4.3 and in Appendix A.
The first author created two sets of rules to guide the sentence classification process:
one for the coarse-grained and another for the fine-grained representation. The rules
operate at clause level. If a clause is deemed summary-worthy, the complete parent
sentence is included in the summary. Figure 6 displays a few examples of rules for the
fine-grained data set (a clause is considered to be summary-worthy if a rule returns
True). The first rule attempts to select clauses that talk about one of the main characters
and contain temporal expressions of type enactment. The rationale for this rule is that
such clauses are likely to describe habitual activities of protagonists (e.g., He always
smoked.) The second rule follows the same rationale but the stativity of the situation
is signaled by the main stative verb. The third rule rejects clauses in progressive tense
because such clauses are unlikely to contain background information.
The set of rules for the fine-grained representation has a tree-like structure. It
processes the features of a clause and outputs a binary prediction. The rules for the
coarse-grained representation function differently. Each clause is assigned a score based
on the values of its features. The system then selects 6% of sentences that contain clauses
with the highest scores. The scores attributed to the particular feature values were
assigned and fine-tuned manually using linguistic knowledge described in Section 4.3.
The reasons why the procedures for the two data sets differ are as follows. Assigning
and fine-tuning the scores is a more flexible process and it is easier to perform manu-
ally. Ideally, we would apply score-based rules to both representations, but assigning
and fine-tuning the scores manually for the fine-grained data set is excessively labor-
intensive: there are too many features with too many values. For instance, one may
want to reward clauses in simple past or present tenses, reflecting the fact that such
clauses are more likely to be descriptive than those in perfect or progressive tenses.
This information is expressed in the coarse-grained data set using one binary feature
simple past present and fine-tuning the score is trivial. On the other hand, the same

information in the fine-grained data set is distributed over three features with a total
of seven values: is perf (yes, no), is progressive (yes, no), and tense (past, present. future).
Distributing the reward among three independent features is far less obvious.
The rules in both data sets, as well as the set of weights used for the coarse-grained
representation, were selected and fine-tuned empirically using the training portion of
the corpus as a guide. Once the parameters had been adjusted, the system produced
two sets of summaries for the test portion of the corpus (one for each representation).

As an alternative to rule construction, in the second set of experiments we performed
decision tree induction with C5.0 (Quinlan 1992) to select salient descriptive sentences.
C5.0 was our choice mainly because of the readability of its output.
The training and test data sets exhibited an almost 1:17 class imbalance (i.e., only 6%
of all annotated clauses belonged to the positive class). Because the corpus was rather
small, we applied a number of techniques to correct class imbalance in the training data
set. These techniques included classification costs, undersampling (randomly removing
instances of the majority class), oversampling (randomly duplicating instances of the
minority class), and synthetic example generation (Chawlar et al. 2002). Using tenfold
cross-validation on the training data set and original annotations by the first author,

we selected the best class-imbalance correction techniques for each representation and
also fine-tuned the learning parameters available in C5.0. These experiments brought
the best results when using classification costs for the coarse-grained data set and
undersampling for the fine-grained data set.
In order to see what features were most informative in each data set, we conducted
a small experiment. We removed one feature at a time from the training set and used the
decrease in F-score as a measure of informativeness. The experiment showed that in the
coarse-grained data set the following features were the most informative: the presence
of a character in a clause, the difference between the index of the current sentence and
the sentence where the character was first mentioned, syntactic function of a character
mention, index of the sentence, and tense. In the fine-grained data set the findings are
similar: the index of the sentence, whether a character mention is a subject, the presence
of a character mention in the clause, and whether the character mention is a pronoun
are more important than the other features.
After selecting the best parameters on the training data set using tenfold cross-
validation, the system produced two sets of summaries for the test data set.

6.1 Overview

<bodyText confidence="0.99994075">
We are not aware of any agreed-upon metrics for evaluating summaries of short fiction.
In fact, it is not wholly clear what makes one summary better than another even for
manual ones. That is why we evaluate our summaries using a variety of metrics and
baselines, hoping to obtain a stereoscopic view of their quality.
The first evaluation experiment aims to measure the informativeness and the use-
fulness of the summaries. It is designed so as to compare the machine-made summaries
with a random baseline and also with a ceiling manual abstracts (henceforth model
summaries). To achieve this, we engaged 15 evaluators to read the summaries and
the stories of the test set and to answer two types of questions about them: factual
(e.g., list main characters of the story) and subjective (e.g., rank readability of the summary).
Such experimental design allowed us to evaluate extrinsically the informativeness of
the summaries and intrinsically their usefulness. Both types of questions were asked
first after reading the summary alone and then after reading the complete story. The
summaries are an anonymous mix of random, machine-made, and model ones (i.e., the
evaluators did not know whether the summaries were produced by programs or by
people). Section 6.2 describes the experiment in detail.
The second round of evaluation aimed to evaluate the summaries by measuring
sentence co-selection with the manually created extracts. It was designed to allow
the comparison of machine-made summaries with two naive baselines and with two
state-of-the-art generic summarizers (baseline summarizers). Section 6.3 contains the
description of this experiment.
The third evaluation experiment compared the machine-made and the baseline
summaries with the manually created abstracts using ROUGE (Lin 2004)a package
for automatically evaluating summaries. This experiment is described in Section 6.4.

produces. The informativeness is measured indirectlyby asking people factual
questions about the story. The linguistic quality and the usefulness are evaluated
intrinsicallyby asking people to rank specific characteristics of the summaries.
Fifteen unbiased evaluators answer both types of questions twice, first after reading
the summary alone and then again after reading the complete storyrepeating the
procedure for all 20 test stories. Asking the questions after reading the summary
alone measures the informativeness and the usefulness of the summaries in a realistic
situation: To an evaluator, the summary is the only source of information about the
original story. Repeating the procedure after reading the complete story evaluates the
summaries in a situation where the evaluator has the complete information about
the source. Each evaluator works with a mix of machine-made, random, and model
summaries with six or seven summaries of each kind. This allows comparing the
performance of our summarizer with a baseline and a ceiling.
Our summarizer produces four different flavors of summaries.10
The labor intensity
of the process prohibits asking the subjects to evaluate all four summary types. That is
also why it is not possible to use more than one baseline or the summaries created
by the baseline systems.11
Restricted to evaluating only one type of the machine-made
summaries, we opt for the coarse-grained rule-based ones, mainly because the coarse-
grained representation and the rules make it easier to trace why the system selects
specific sentences.
Conditions to be tested. We evaluate three factual and four subjective characteristics
of the summaries.

r the location
r the time
when the summary is the only source of information about the story.
Subjective
r How readable the summaries are.
r How much irrelevant information they contain.
r How complete they are.
r How useful they are for deciding whether to read the complete story.
Evaluating these facets of the summaries reveals whether we achieve the objective of
producing informative summaries. The focus of the system was not on readability. Still,
we evaluate how readable the summaries are, because severe lack of coherence may
prevent people from correctly interpreting the available information. We have provided

and 5.
Baselines. We compare the machine-made summaries with a baseline and a ceiling.
The baseline consists of randomly selected sentences. Both the machine-made and the
random summaries contain the same number of sentences. The ceiling consists of the
summaries written by two human subjects. The summary writers were instructed to
write 20 summaries of short stories in a way that does not reveal all of the plot. They
received one example summary and were allowed to reuse sentences from the stories,
to employ metaphor and any other literary devices they found useful.
Metrics. The evaluators answered the factual questions about the main characters
and the location of the story in their own words. The first author rated the answers
on the scale of 1 to 3. A score of 3 means that the answer is complete and correct,
2 = slightly incomplete, 1 = very incomplete, 0 = the subject cannot find the answer
in the text, and 1 = the answer is incorrect. The question asking to identify the time
frame of the story is a multiple-choice one: select the century when the story takes place.
The answers to this question are rated on a binary scale (1 if the answer is correct,
0 if it is not or if the subject cannot infer time from the text). We calculate the mean
answers for each question and compare them across summary types using the Kruskal
Wallis test and the MannWhitney test (also known as the Wilcoxon RankSum test).
The tests are appropriate when the response variable is ordinal and the dependent
variable is categorical. Both tests are based on assigning ranks to the available data
points.
The KruskalWallis test is a nonparametric test used to determine whether several
samples come from the same population. It is based on calculating the K statistic which
follows 2

positive property. We opt for a scale with an even number of available values so as
to avoid the evaluators giving excessive preference to the middle rank. We measure

Subjects. The participants for the experiment were recruited by the means of adver-
tising at the Department of Linguistics at the University of Ottawa. Most of them are
third- and fourth-year undergraduate students of linguistics. The only requirement for
participation was to be a native speaker of English. We hired two people to create model
summaries for the 20 stories of the test set. The summary writers worked approximately
1520 hours each. Fifteen people were hired to evaluate the summaries (i.e., to read
the summarystory pairs and answer the questions). The task of evaluating a sum-
mary required approximately 1215 hours of labor per person. All participants were
paid. The instructions for summary writers are available at www.site.uottawa.ca/
ankazant/instructions-writers.zip. The instructions for evaluators can be found
at www.site.uottawa.ca/ankazant/instructions eval.zip.
Material. Each evaluator received 20 summarystory pairs. Because some questions
sought to measure the informativeness of the summary, every evaluator worked on 20
distinct stories of the test set and no one worked with the same story more than once.
The summaries were a randomly selected mix of random, machine-made, and model
summaries.
Procedure. The experiment was conducted remotely. The summary writers received
the test set of stories and the instructions and had seven working days to submit their
abstracts. A week later, we sent randomly generated packages of summarystory pairs
to the evaluators. The packages contained between six and seven summaries of each
kind (random, machine-made, and model). Each evaluator worked with exactly one
summary for each story, reading a total of 20 pairs. Every summary was evaluated by
five subjects. The evaluators had seven working days to complete the task.
Results. Informativeness. Table 4 shows the results of comparing the mean an-
swers between the machine-made, the baseline, and the model summaries using the
KruskalWallis and MannWhitney tests. The column Groups shows homogeneous
groups, identified using the MannWhitney test with 99.67% confidence (recall that
per-comparison confidence level = 0.0033). The groups are denoted using distinct
literals (e.g., A, B, C).

The differences between the machine-made summaries and the random ones
are significant for the questions about characters and the location of the story. This
shows that in these respects the machine-made summaries arerather predictably
consistently more informative than the random ones. The difference between the
machine-made and the random summaries is not statistically significant for the question
asking to name the time of the story. Keeping in mind how rare absolute temporal
anchors are in short stories, this is not surprising. The manual summaries, however,
are ranked higher with statistical significance. This may suggest that the machine-made
summaries are not as coherent as the model ones, which prevents the reader from
finding implicit cues about timeframe available in the summaries.
The differences between the machine-made and the model summaries are signifi-
cant for the questions about the time and the place of the story, but not for the questions
about the main characters. This suggests that the machine-made summaries are almost
as informative as the model ones when it comes to informing the reader whom the story
is about. They cannot, however, give the reader as good an idea about the time and the
place of the story as the model summaries can.
All summary types are less informative than the complete story; that is, the differ-
ences between answers obtained after reading the summary alone and after reading the
complete story are significant in all cases.
Usefulness and linguistic quality. Table 5 shows mean ranks for the three summary
types, along with the homogeneous groups identified using the MannWhitney test,
with 99.67% confidence. The request to rank readability was made only onceafter
reading the summary; the request to evaluate the completeness was made only after
reading the complete story. (The corresponding cells in Table 5 are empty.)
The results reveal that the evaluators consistently rank the model summaries as
best, the machine-made summaries as second-best, and the random ones as worst. The
differences between summary types are significant in all cases.
The readability of the machine-made summaries is ranked as slightly better than

usefulness), the machine-made summaries are ranked as slightly worse than average
(around 2.81). This shows that even though the summaries are somewhat useful and
consistently outperform the random baseline, they fall short of the quality of the manual
abstracts. This is hardly surprising given the inherent difficulty of summarizing fiction
and the exploratory nature of this work. It is worth remarking that even the model
summaries do not appear to be perfect: The evaluators ranked them around 5.20, even
though they had significantly worse summaries to compare against. This may suggest
that the task is not easy even for people, let alone for a computer program.

6.3 Comparing the Machine-Made Summaries and the Manually Created Extracts
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.998445395348837">
Measuring sentence co-selection between extractive summaries created by humans and
those created by automatic summarizers has a long tradition in the text summarization
community (Lin and Hovy 2000; Marcu 2000), but this family of measures has a number
of well-known shortcomings. As many have remarked on previous occasions (Mani
2001; Radev et al. 2003), co-selection measures do not provide a complete assessment of
the quality of a summary. First of all, when a summary in question contains sentences
that do not appear in any of the model extracts, one may not be sure that those sentences
are uninformative or inappropriate for inclusion in a summary. In addition, documents
have internal discourse structure and sentences are often inter-dependent. Therefore,
even if a summary contains sentences found in one or more reference summaries, it
does not always mean that it is advisable to include those sentences in the summary in
question.
Sentence co-selection does not explicitly measure the quality of a summary. It does,
however, measure a quality that is objective and easy to pin down: how many sentences
that humans judge summary-worthy are included in the machine-made summary.
Such a metric is a useful complement to the results reported in Section 6.2. It has the
advantage of being easy to interpret and comprehend. It also has a long tradition of
usage which allows us to compare our summarizeron a familiar scalewith other
summarization systems. That is why we chose co-selection as the basis for comparing
the summaries that our system produces with manually created extracts.13
Overview. The experiment involves six annotators divided into two groups of three.
Each annotator is asked to read 10 short stories and to select 6% of sentences that, in their
opinion, constitute a good indicative summary. In this manner three people annotate
each story of the test set for summary-worthy sentences. We used their annotations as a
gold standard and compared the machine-made summaries against them. In addition,
we used the same gold standard and metrics to evaluate the quality of two baseline
summaries and of two summaries produced by state-of-the art summarization systems.
Conditions to be tested. The purpose of the experiment is defined as measuring how
many sentences found in our systems summaries and the baseline summaries occur in
the extractive summaries created by the human annotators. We are also interested in
finding out whether our summarizer outperforms the trivial baseline algorithms and
the existing state-of-the-art summarizers fine-tuned to summarizing newswire.
Baselines. In order to evaluate our summarizer comparatively, we defined two naive
baselines and a ceiling. Intuitively, when a person wishes to decide whether to read
a book, she opens it and flips through several pages at the beginning. Imitating this
process, we computed a simple lead baseline consisting of the first 6% of the sentences in
a story. The second baseline consists of 6% of sentences of the story selected at random.
The ceiling consists of all sentences deemed summary-worthy by one of the human
annotators.
13 We decided against using deeper approaches, such as the Pyramid method (Nenkova and Passonneau
2004), factoids (van Halteren and Teufel 2003), and relative utility (Radev and Tam 2003). The reason is
practical: These approaches have an unfortunate disadvantage of being considerably more
labor-intensive than the measures based on sentence co-selection.

\x0cKazantseva and Szpakowicz Summarizing Short Stories
It is also necessary to see whether our genre-specific approach shows any improve-
ments over the existing generic state-of-the-art systems put to work on fiction. To this
end, we compared our summarizer with two systems that were top performers in the
Document Understanding Conference (henceforth DUC) 2007, the annual competi-
tion for automatic summarizers. In DUC competitions the summarization systems
are evaluated on a variety of metrics: manually assigned scores (ranking readability,
grammaticality, non-redundancy, referential clarity, focus, and coherence), the pyramid
method (Nenkova and Passonneau 2004), and ROUGE scores (Lin 2004). There is no
unified ranking of the systems performance, and selecting the best summarizer is
not straightforward. We chose two systems among the top performers in DUC 2007
GISTexter (Harabagiu, Hickl, and Lacatusu 2007) and CLASSY (Schlesinger, OLeary,
and Conroy 2008; Conroy, Schlesinger, and OLeary 2007). GISTexter appears to be
the best summarizer according to the scores assigned by the human judges. Apart
from baselines, it is consistently ranked as the best or the second-best system on most
characteristics evaluated by the judges (the only exception is non-redundancy where
GISTexter is ranked eighth). CLASSY, on the other hand, is one of the four top systems
according to ROUGE scores. The scores it received from the human judges are also
quite good.
The main task in DUC 2007 called for creating 250-word summaries from a collec-
tion of newswire articles on a specific topic. Each input collection was accompanied by
a topic statement that briefly explained what the summaries should cover. Therefore,
both CLASSY and GISTexter are geared towards multi-document query-based sum-
marization of newswirea task dramatically different from that of summarizing short
fiction.14
No adjustments were made to either system to make them more suitable for
summarizing stories. Therefore, the comparison is not wholly fair, butin the absence
of systems similar to oursit was the only possibility to compare our summarizer with
the state-of-the-art in the community and to verify whether genre-specific methods are
useful in summarizing fiction.
Evaluation metrics. By combining summaries created by the annotators in several
ways we create three distinct gold-standard summaries. The majority gold-standard
summary contains all sentences selected by at least two judges. It is best suited to give
an overall picture of how similar the machine-made summaries are to the man-made
ones. The union gold standard is obtained by considering all sentences that are judged
summary-worthy by at least one judge. Union summaries provide a more relaxed
measurement. Precision computed on the basis of the union gold standard gives an idea
of how many irrelevant sentences a given summary contains (sentences not selected by
any of the three judges are more likely to prove irrelevant). The intersection summaries
are obtained by combining sentences that all three judges deemed to be important.
Recall measured on the basis of the intersection gold standard says how many of the
most important sentences are included in summaries produced by the system (sentences
selected by all three judges are likely to be the most important ones). All summaries
are compared against each gold-standard summary using precision (P), recall (R), and

The statistical significance of the differences between various types of summaries
is established using the one-way Analysis Of Variance test (ANOVA) and the Tukey
Honestly Significant Differences test (henceforth Tukey HSD).
ANOVA tests whether the differences between sample means are significant by
comparing variance between samples with total variance within samples:

S 2

</equation>
<bodyText confidence="0.996602444444444">
where p is the number of samples, n is the total number of observations, Sbetween is the
sum of squared deviations between sample means and the total mean, and Swithin is
the total sum of squared deviations within samples. The f statistic is distributed as F
when the null hypothesis is true (i.e., the differences between sample means are not
significant).
The power of ANOVA extends as far as verifying whether the differences between
sample means are significant overall, but the test does not say anything about differ-
ences between particular pairs of sample means. Tukey HSD is a test that does just that.
It measures q, the studentized range statistic:

<equation confidence="0.99326225">
q =

SE
(9)
</equation>
<bodyText confidence="0.982607363636364">
where Ml is the larger of the sample means, Ms is the smaller one, and SE is the standard
error of the data in question. In accordance with our interpretation of the three types of
gold standards, we use the most meaningful measurement for each standard: F-score
for the majority, precision for the union, and recall for the intersection. We also use the
same measurement to set the ceiling for each standard (i.e., by choosing the manually
created extract that compares best on that scale).
Before combining the extracts created by the annotators into gold-standard sum-
maries, we measure how well these people agree among themselves. We estimate
the agreement using Scotts (Scott 1955).15
This coefficient measures the observed
agreement between judges corrected for chance agreement.

Subjects. Six human subjects participated in annotating the test set of stories for the
presence of summary-worthy sentences. These people are colleagues and acquaintances
of the first author. At the time of the experiment none of them was familiar with the
design of the system. Four annotators are native speakers of English and the remaining
two have a very good command of the language.
Materials. The material for the experiment consisted of the 20 stories of the test set.
Three annotators created extractive summaries for each story. In addition, there were
eight distinct automatically produced summaries per story: four summaries produced
by our system, two baseline summaries, and two summaries created by the baseline
systems from DUC.
Procedure. The experiment was conducted by e-mail. The annotators received the
stories and had two weeks to annotate them. The participants reported having taken
1020 hours to complete the task.
Results. Agreement. Table 6 reports the agreement between the judges within each
group and with the first author of this article. The agreement with the first author is
reported because she created the initial training and test data for experiments. The num-
bers 3 and 4 state whether the statistic is computed only for three subjects participating
in the evaluation or for four subjects (including the first author). As can be seen from
Table 6, the agreement statistics are computed for each group separately. This is because
the sets of stories that they annotated are disjoint. The Average column shows an
average of these figures, to give a better overall idea.
The agreement values in Table 6 are rather low. They fall well below the 0.8 cut-off
point specified by Krippendorff (2004). On a less demanding scale, Landis and Koch
</bodyText>

(1977) interpret values in the range of 0.210.4 as fair agreement and in the range of

Weak agreement is not surprising: Many researchers

Cohens (Cohen 1960). In our setting, however, the values of , and are almost the same.

report that people do not agree well on what sentences constitute a good summary of
a document (Rath, Resnick, and Savage 1961; Salton et al. 1997; Lin and Hovy 2003). In
most cases the agreement corresponding to of 0.42 would not be sufficient for creating
a resource, but we interpret this level of agreement as acceptable for evaluating a single
facet of the summaries that are also evaluated in other ways.
Co-selection. Tables 79 show the results of comparing eight different versions of the
computer-made summaries against the gold-standard summaries produced by people.
In each table, the entry HUMAN corresponds to the summaries created by the annotator
who achieves the highest scores for the corresponding standard. The Groups (metric)
column reports homogeneous groups identified using Tukey HSD with 95% confidence
for the specified metric.
Our system outperforms both baseline algorithms and the baseline summarizers,
but it always falls short of the performance of the best human summary. The improve-
ment margins between the random and the baseline systems summaries and those
produced by our system are rather wide. The weaker performance of the baseline
summarizers strongly suggests the need for genre-specific methods when summarizing
short fiction.
The differences between the lead summaries and the system-made ones are also
statistically significant, yet they are much narrower. We interpret this as an indication
that the lead baseline is more demanding than the random one when creating indicative
summaries of short fiction.

The results also suggest that automatically produced summaries bear some resem-
blance to manual ones. There is no straightforward way to interpret these results as
good or bad in the context of other summarization systems. Firstly, the task is new and
no comparable results exist. Secondly, even though sentence co-selection metrics have
been widely used for evaluating summaries of other genres, different compression rates,
different gold standards, and availability of naturally occurring competitive baselines
(e.g., lead baseline in newswire summarization) make fair comparison difficult. For
example, Marcu (2000, page 214) reports achieving F-score of 76.04 when creating sum-
maries of newswire articles at 10% of their original length. The lead baseline achieves
F-score of 71.89. When summarizing dialogues, Zechner (2002, page 479) reports
weighted accuracy of 0.614 compared to the lead baselines performance of 0.438 (the
numbers are averages over five different summary sizes of 5%, 10%, 15%, 20%, and
25%). In this context we interpret the results in Tables 79 as suggesting that our genre-
specific system outperforms the naive baselines and two generic summarizers.

6.4 Evaluating Summaries using Lexical Overlap
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.994335642857143">
ROUGE (Lin 2004) is a package for automatically evaluating summaries. Given one
or more gold-standard summaries (usually written by people), ROUGE offers several
metrics for evaluating the summary in question. The metrics reward lexical overlap
between the model summaries and the candidate one. Depending on the metric, the
lexical units taken into consideration are n-grams, word sequences, and word pairs.
Since 2004, ROUGE scores have been among the measures used for evaluating au-
tomatic summarizers at DUC. Following this tradition, we ran ROUGE to evaluate our
summaries and to compare them to the baselines (including CLASSY and GISTexter).
Conditions to be tested. The objective of the experiment was to establish how
much lexical overlap exists between the machine-made and the model summaries. We
achieved this by computing ROUGE-2 and ROUGE-SU4 scores.17
Baselines and material. We evaluated eight types of summaries: four types created
by our summarizer, the lead and the random baselines, and the summaries created by
17 ROUGE-2 and ROUGE-SU4 are two measures that were used at DUC 2007.

GISTexter and CLASSY. In addition, we included a ceiling by computing ROUGE scores
for the model summaries.
Metrics. ROUGE-2 score measures the bigram recall between the reference summary
and the candidate one. It is computed according to the following formula:
</bodyText>
<equation confidence="0.9602386">
ROUGE-2 =
\x02
sS

bs Countmatch(b)
\x02
sS
\x02
bs Count(b)
(13)
</equation>
<bodyText confidence="0.992788833333333">
where S is the set of reference summaries, b is a bigram in the reference summary s,
Countmatch(b) is the number of bigrams that both summaries share, and Count(b) is the
total number of bigrams in the reference summary s.
ROUGE-S measures the similarity of a pair of summaries based on how many
skip-bigrams they have in common. A skip-bigram is any pair of words in a sentence,
allowing for arbitrary gaps.
</bodyText>
<equation confidence="0.961386">
ROUGE-S =
SKIP2(X, Y)
C(m, 2)
(14)
</equation>
<bodyText confidence="0.994893451612903">
where X is the reference summary of length m, Y is the candidate summary, SKIP2(X,Y)
is the number of skip-bigram matches between X and Y, and C is the combination
function.
ROUGE-SU4 is an extension of ROUGE-S that also rewards matching unigrams.
The maximum gap allowed by skip-bigrams is 4 (hence SU4).
In order to compare the automatically produced summaries with those created by
humans we implemented the following leave-one-out procedure. At first, we computed
ROUGE scores by comparing all automatically produced summaries (i.e., those created
by our system and the baseline ones) and one of the model summaries against the
second available model summary. Next, the procedure was repeated but the model
summaries were switched. The significance of the differences was tested using ANOVA
and Tukey HSD for 95% confidence level. When calculating ANOVA and Tukey HSD,
we used the scores obtained from both runs.
Results. Tables 10 and 11 show ROUGE-2 and ROUGE-SU4 scores for all automati-
cally produced and model summaries. The results are inconclusive.
When using ROUGE-2 as a guide, the only summaries consistently different from
the rest with 95% confidence are the randomly generated ones. The scores of all other
summaries are too close to reject the hypothesis that the differences are due to chance.
This is the case even with the differences between the model and the automatically
produced summaries. A possible interpretation could be that all summaries are of
very high quality that is indistinguishable from that of the model summaries. This
hypothesis, however, can be easily dismissed: The results reported in Sections 6.2 and
6.3 clearly show that the quality of the summaries produced by our system is well below
the ceiling.
The situation is similar with ROUGE-SU4 scores, if not so dramatic. There are three
distinct groups of summaries. Group A includes the rule-based fine-grained summaries
and those produced by CLASSY. The second group includes the lead baseline, three
types of summaries created by our summarizer, the model summaries, and those cre-
ated by GISTexter. The last group contains the random and the lead baselines. Even
though ROUGE-SU4 measurement seems to have more discriminative power, it is at
least puzzling that it cannot distinguish between the model and the automatically

produced summaries. In particular, placing the rule-based coarse-grained summaries
and the model ones in the same group directly contradicts the results reported in
Section 6.2that people find the model summaries far superior to this particular type
of summary produced by our summarizer.
We interpret these results as suggesting that the ROUGE-2 and ROUGE-SU4 scores
are not well suited for evaluating indicative summaries of short stories. An explana-
tion could be that when people summarize fictionrather than newswire or scientific
papersthey seem to use fewer sentences and clauses verbatim and, by and large, in-
troduce more generalization and abstraction. (We have made this informal observation
when processing the model summaries used in this experiment.) This results in little
lexical overlap with the source text and hence with extractive summaries of any flavor.
This hypothesis, however, is only preliminary and requires further investigation.18
18 It is possible that significantly increasing the number of model summaries would alleviate the problem.
Unfortunately, obtaining so many model summaries was prohibitively expensive in our case. To move in
this direction, we ran ROUGE without jackknifing to enable the use of two model summaries for
comparison. The results were similar to those reported in Tables 10 and 11: Only the random summaries
are consistently significantly worse than the rest.

7. Conclusions
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.998450666666667">
We presented an approach to summarizing literary short stories. The text sum-
marization community has not yet seriously explored this genre, except for early sem-
inal work on story understanding. In contrast with the story-understanding systems
proposed in the 1970s and 1980s, our system does not require labor-intensive semantic
resourcesknowledge-bases and schemasand it works on real-life stories, namely,
short fiction.
The summaries that the system produces, limited in scope, are intended to help
readers form adequate expectations about the original story. We have demonstrated
that such summaries can be produced without deep semantic resources, only relying
on syntax and the information about important entities in the story. According to the
judges who evaluated the summaries, our summaries are somewhat useful for their
original purpose, even if their quality falls far short of the quality of manual abstracts.
Our summaries appear better than the naive baselines and than two state-of-the-art
summarizers fine-tuned for working with newswire.
In the course of this work we have made a number of observations about automatic
summarization of short stories. First of all, we confirmed informally that characters
tend to be a central element of short fiction. Character mentions provide a wealth
of information that can be leveraged in automatic summarization. This finding was
also reflected in the approach proposed by Lehnert (1982). In addition, it appears that
position in text is important, as can be seen from the analysis of the usefulness of
features in Section 5.3. Besides, relatively high performance of the lead baselines also
suggests that position in text is a good indicator of salience, even though it plays a
lesser role than in more structured documents.
We view this work as a small step towards creating tools for searching, summa-
rizing, and otherwise processing fiction available electronically. The current system
accomplishes with some success a limited task of producing indicative summaries or
short stories, but much more work is needed to create high-quality flexible summaries of
literary works suitable for more than one purpose. Perhaps the most obvious extension
to the current system would be summarizing the plot of short stories. Although this is
not useful given our original criterion (forming adequate expectations about the story,
without spoilers), the ability to handle plot would allow the creation of different
types of summaries. We also hope to explore the possibility of establishing structure
within stories: Knowing that certain portions of a story lay out the setting while
others describe events or the culmination would be a significant step towards better
summarization.
Evaluation of summaries of literary work is yet another dimension of the task that
needs to be considered. We have concentrated thus far on summary production rather
than on establishing the criteria that define the quality of the summary. Evaluation
of summaries remains an issue even where well-structured factual documents are
concerned. In fiction, it is far less clear what contributes towards the quality of the
summary: The facts, for instance, are likely to be less important than in scientific papers
or news items. Other candidate qualities may include closeness to the language or the
tone of the original story, the information about the author, the time period, or ideology
behind a certain work of fiction. This remains an open question, the answer to which
may well lie outside the field of computational linguistics.

<abstract confidence="0.938597333333333">Polish Academy of Sciences We present an approach to the automatic creation of extractive summaries of literary short stories. The summaries are produced with a specific objective in mind: to help a reader decide whether she would be interested in reading the complete story. To this end, the summaries give the user relevant information about the setting of the story without revealing its plot. The system relies on assorted surface indicators about clauses in the short story, the most important of which are those related to the aspectual type of a clause and to the main entities in a story. Fifteen judges evaluated the summaries on a number of extrinsic and intrinsic measures. The outcome of this evaluation suggests that the summaries are helpful in achieving the original objective.</abstract>

Related Work Summarization of literary prose is a relatively unexplored topic. There exists, however, a substantial body of research tackling the problem of story comprehension. During the 1970s and 1980s, a number of researchers in artificial intelligence built storyunderstanding systems that relied in one way or another on contemporary research in psychology and discourse processing. Much of that line of research relied on an assumption that stories exhibit global cognitive structure (known as macrostructure [van Dijk 1980] or schema [Bartlett 1932]) and that they can be decomposed into a finite number of cognitive units. According to this view, diversity in stories is not due to an infinite number of plots, but to an infinite number of combinations of a (relatively) small number of cognitive units. This direction was pioneered in 1928 by Vladimir Propp (1968) with his detailed analysis of 100 Russian folk tales. After a period of oblivion, these ideas regained popularity: van Dijk and Kintsch (1978) demonstrated the existence of macrostructures and their role in story comprehension and recall; Rumelhart (1975), Thorndyke (1975), and Ma</context>

In addition, more researchers have been venturing past purely extractive summarization (Krahmer, Marsi, and van Pelt 2008; Nomoto 2007; McDonald 2006). By and large, however, most research in text summarization still revolves around texts characterized by rigid structure. The better explored among such texts are news articles (Barzilay and McKeown 2005), medical documents (Elhadad et al. 2005), legal documents (Moens 2007), and papers in the area of computer science (Teufel and Moens 2002; Mei and Zhai 2008). Although summarizing these genres is a formidable challenge in itself, it excludes a continually increasing number of informal documents available electronically. Such documents, ranging from novels to personal Web pages, offer a wealth of information that merits the attention of the text summarization community.

The training and test data sets exhibited an almost 1:17 class imbalance (i.e., only 6% of all annotated clauses belonged to the positive class). Because the corpus was rather small, we applied a number of techniques to correct class imbalance in the training data set. These techniques included classification costs, undersampling (randomly removing instances of the majority class), oversampling (randomly duplicating instances of the minority class), and synthetic example generation (Chawlar et al. 2002).

It could be adapted to new kinds of documents by extending its knowledge base and not the underlying algorithm or patterns. Research in automatic story comprehension offered a number of important solutions for subsequent developments in artificial intelligence. No less important, it pointed out a number of challenges. All these systems required a formidable amount of semantic knowledge and a robust and efficient way of building a semantic representation of texts. In addition, systems such as BORIS or SAM (Cullingford 1978) also needed a set of schemas or schema-like scenarios. With such labor intensity, these requirements prohibit using schema-based approaches for real-life stories (e.g., fiction) and only allow the processing of artificially created examples. In this historical context, our current approach to summarization of short fiction appears rather modest: Our system does not understand stories, nor does it retell their plot. Instead, it offers the reader hintsimportant information about the storys settingwhich should help her guess what type of story is to come. This assumption appears reasonable becau</context>

Identifying Important Entities During the first stage of summary production the system identifies important entities in stories. Initially, we planned to identify three types of entities: people, locations, and time stamps. During a preliminary exploration of the corpus, we analyzed 14 stories for the presence of surface indicators of characters, locations, and temporal anchors.4 We employed the GATE Gazetteer (Cunningham et al. 2002), and only considered entities it recognized automatically. The experiment revealed that the stories in the corpus contained multiple mentions of characters (on average, 64 mentions per story, excluding pronouns). On the other hand, the 14 stories contained only 22 location markers, mostly street names. Four stories had no identifiable location markers. Finally, merely four temporal anchors were identified in all 14 stories: two absolute (such as year) and two relative (e.g., Christmas).

Fifteen judges evaluated the summaries on a number of extrinsic and intrinsic measures. The outcome of this evaluation suggests that the summaries are helpful in achieving the original objective. 1. Introduction In the last decade, automatic text summarization has become a popular research topic with a curiously restricted scope of applications. A few innovative research directions have emerged, including headline generation (Soricut and Marcu 2007), summarization of books (Mihalcea and Ceylan 2007), personalized summarization (Daz and Gervas 2007), generation of tables-of-contents (Branavan, Deshpande, and Barzilay 2007), summarization of speech (Fuentes et al. 2005), dialogues (Zechner 2002), evaluative text (Carenini, Ng, and Pauls 2006), and biomedical documents (Reeve, Han, and Brooks 2007). In addition, more researchers have been venturing past purely extractive summarization (Krahmer, Marsi, and van Pelt 2008; Nomoto 2007; McDonald 2006). By and large, however, most research in text summarization still revolves around texts characterized by rigid structure.

These approaches, however, attempt to determine properties of verbs viewed in isolation and do not deal with particular usages in the context of concrete sentences. That is why we cannot directly re-apply that research in determining the aspectual type of clauses. 8 By parent sentence we mean the sentence from which the clause is taken. 81 \x0cComputational Linguistics Volume 36, Number 1 Table 3 Privative featural identification of aspectual classes after Dorr and Olsen (1997).

Lexical aspect of a verb. Lexical aspect refers to a property of a verb when viewed in isolation, without regard to the context provided by a particular clause. Just as for clauses, a verb may be a state (or stative) verb (e.g., believe), or an event verb (e.g., run). Event verbs are further subdivided into verbs of activity (e.g., read), accomplishment (e.g., take a test), and achievement (e.g., drop). The relation between the lexical aspect of a verb and the aspect of a clause has been discussed by Vendler (1967), Dorr and Olsen (1997), and Huddleston and Pullum (2002, pages 118123). Dorr and Olsen have proposed a privative model of this relationsee Table 3. The model states that verbs are categorized into aspectual classes based on whether they exhibit one or more of the following properties: dynamicity, durativity, and telicity. Dorr and Olsen speculate that, depending on the context of usage, verbs may form clauses that have more of these properties than the main verb viewed in isolation, but that it is impossible for a verb to shed one of its properties. We illustrate this in Examples 3a and 3b. In Example 3a the state </context>

(activity) 9 The lexical aspect of a verb influences the aspect of a clause. Several features in our system capture this information. The fine-grained data set contains three features with six possible values that show whether the main verb of a clause is durative, dynamic, or telic. The coarse-grained data set contains a single feature with four possible values (the lexical aspect of a verb according to the model in Table 3). We derive this information from a manually compiled database of Lexical Conceptual Structures (Dorr and Olsen 1997), which contains these properties for 4,432 English verbs. 9 Throughout this paper, the asterisk (*) denotes incorrect or marginally correct usage. 82 \x0cKazantseva and Szpakowicz Summarizing Short Stories Grammatical tense.

Temporal markers (often referred to as temporal adverbials), such as usually, never, suddenly, at that moment, and many others, are widely employed to mark the aspectual type of a sentence (Dowty 1979; Harkness 1987; By 2002). Such markers provide a wealth of information and often unambiguously signal aspectual type. For example: (8a) She read a lot tonight. (8b) She always read a lot. (or She used to read a lot.) Such expressions are not easy to capture automatically, however. In order to use the information expressed in temporal adverbials, we analyzed the training part of the corpus for the presence of such expressions. There were 295 occurrences in 10 stories.

The developments in psychology and discourse processing had gone hand in hand with those in artificial intelligence and resulted in a score of story-understanding and question-answering systems. Many of these relied on a set of manually encoded schemas and chose the most appropriate one for a given story (Cullingford 1978; Dyer 1983; Leake 1989). For example, a system called BORIS (Dyer 1983) processed stories word-by-word to create a very rich semantic representation of them using Memory Organization Packets (MOPs) and Thematic Affect Units (TAUs). These knowledge structures were activated by means of a very detailed lexicon where each lexeme was associated with MOPs and TAUs it could invoke. Systems such as BORIS could not process stories that did not conform to schemas already at their disposal.

Due to the high degree of ambiguity, our system handles clauses with have as the main verb in a manner different from all other clauses. This machinery remains the same regardless of what options are used for the granularity of representation and for sentence selection procedures. In order to handle have-clauses, our system contains an implementation of an approach proposed by Siegel (1998a). The solution relies on WordNet (Fellbaum 1998) and contains a set of rules that determine the aspectual type of a have-clause based on the top WordNet category of the direct object. For instance, the direct object lunch from Example 11a belongs to the category food and, according to rules from Siegel (1998a), the aspectual type of a clause is event. The direct object friend from Example 11b belongs to the category person, so the aspectual type of the clause is state.

The output of this module consists of short stories annotated for the presence of location markers and main character mentions. 4. Selecting Descriptive Sentences Using Aspectual Information 4.1 Linguistic Definition of Aspect We rely on aspect to select salient sentences that set out the background of a story. In this paper, the term aspect denotes the same concept as what Huddleston and Pullum (2002, page 118) call the situation type. The term refers to different ways of viewing the internal temporal consistency of a situation (Comrie 1976, page 3). Informally, the aspect of a clause suggests the temporal flow of an event or a state and the speakers position with respect to it. A general aspectual classification based on Huddleston and Pullum (2002) appears in Figure 4, with examples for each type. 5 Lappin and Leass (1994) present a rule-based algorithm for resolving pronominal anaphora. The algorithm suggests the most likely antecedent after taking into account the candidates syntactic</context>

Such situations are referred to as accomplishments. On the other hand, playing golf or talking on the phone does not imply that the process must end with a specific conclusion and the situation is atelic. Such situations are called activities. In addition, the aspectual type of a clause may be altered by multiplicity, for example, repetitions. Consider Examples 2a and 2b. (2a) She read a book. (2b) She read a book a day. Example 2b is referred to as a serial situation (Huddleston and Pullum 2002, page 123).

Lexical aspect refers to a property of a verb when viewed in isolation, without regard to the context provided by a particular clause. Just as for clauses, a verb may be a state (or stative) verb (e.g., believe), or an event verb (e.g., run). Event verbs are further subdivided into verbs of activity (e.g., read), accomplishment (e.g., take a test), and achievement (e.g., drop). The relation between the lexical aspect of a verb and the aspect of a clause has been discussed by Vendler (1967), Dorr and Olsen (1997), and Huddleston and Pullum (2002, pages 118123). Dorr and Olsen have proposed a privative model of this relationsee Table 3. The model states that verbs are categorized into aspectual classes based on whether they exhibit one or more of the following properties: dynamicity, durativity, and telicity. Dorr and Olsen speculate that, depending on the context of usage, verbs may form clauses that have more of these properties than the main verb viewed in isolation, but that it is impossible for a verb to shed one of its properties. We illustrate this in Examples 3a and 3b. In Example 3a the state verb know participates in an acco</context>

The grammatical tense used in a particular clause places a number of constraints on its aspectual type. For instance, simple tenses are more likely to be used in stative or habitual situations than progressive or perfect tenses. It is also commonly accepted (Dowty 1979; Huddleston and Pullum 2002, page 119) that stative clauses cannot be realized using progressive tenses (see Examples 4a and 4b). Huddleston and Pullum (2002, page 121) stipulate that it is also the case with achievement clauses (see Example 4c). (4a) John is running. (event, activity) (4b) *John is knowing the answer. (state) (4c) *John was recognizing her. (event, accomplishment) Among the constraints that grammatical tense imposes there is the special relation between simple present tense and event clauses. As a rule, clauses realized in simple present tense cannot denote events, but only states (Huddleston and Pullu</context>

The error rates for pronominal anaphora resolution are significantly lower than those for noun phrase anaphora resolution (15.07% vs. 36.84%).

For example, the expressions this year, next year, that long year can all be reduced to a template \x02some expression year\x03. Possible values of \x02time expression\x03 are further restricted to allow only valid modifiers (e.g., last, next, but not yellow). The system captures temporal expressions using a cascade of regular expression. It first identifies the least ambiguous unit (in this example 83 \x0cComputational Linguistics Volume 36, Number 1 year) and then attempts to find the boundaries of the expression. The complete list of regular expressions used appears in Kazantseva (2006). Three features characterize each template: the type of the temporal expression (location, duration, frequency, or enactment) (Harkness 1987); magnitude (year, day, etc.); and plurality (year vs. years). The fine-grained data set contains three such features with 14 possible values (type of expression, its magnitude, and plurality). The coarse-grained data set contains one binary feature (whether a clause contains an expression that denotes a long period of time). Voice.

C5.0 was our choice mainly because of the readability of its output.

In the course of this work we have made a number of observations about automatic summarization of short stories. First of all, we confirmed informally that characters tend to be a central element of short fiction. Character mentions provide a wealth of information that can be leveraged in automatic summarization. This finding was also reflected in the approach proposed by Lehnert (1982). In addition, it appears that position in text is important, as can be seen from the analysis of the usefulness of features in Section 5.3. Besides, relatively high performance of the lead baselines also suggests that position in text is a good indicator of salience, even though it plays a lesser role than in more structured documents. We view this work as a small step towards creating tools for searching, summarizing, and otherwise processing fiction available electronically.

During the second evaluative experiment, the machine-made summaries are compared against extracts created by people using sentence co-selection measures (precision, recall, and F-score). By sentence co-selection we mean measuring how many sentences found in manually created extracts are selected for inclusion in automatically produced summaries. The results suggest that our system outperforms all baselines, including state-of-the-art summarizers. The third part of the evaluation uses two ROUGE metrics (Lin 2004) to compare the machine-made and the baseline summaries with the model abstracts. The results suggest that these measures are not well suited for evaluating extractive indicative summaries of short stories. This paper is organized in the following manner. Section 2 gives a brief overview of the body of research in automatic story comprehension. Section 3 describes the process of identifying important entities in short stories.

To this end, we compared our summarizer with two systems that were top performers in the Document Understanding Conference (henceforth DUC) 2007, the annual competition for automatic summarizers. In DUC competitions the summarization systems are evaluated on a variety of metrics: manually assigned scores (ranking readability, grammaticality, non-redundancy, referential clarity, focus, and coherence), the pyramid method (Nenkova and Passonneau 2004), and ROUGE scores (Lin 2004). There is no unified ranking of the systems performance, and selecting the best summarizer is not straightforward. We chose two systems among the top performers in DUC 2007 GISTexter (Harabagiu, Hickl, and Lacatusu 2007) and CLASSY (Schlesinger, OLeary, and Conroy 2008; Conroy, Schlesinger, and OLeary 2007). GISTexter appears to be the best summarizer according to the scores assigned by the human judges. Apart from baselines, it is consistently ranked as the best or the second-best system on most characteristics evaluated by the judges (the only exception is non-redundancy where GISTexter is </context>

The lead baseline achieves F-score of 71.89. When summarizing dialogues, Zechner (2002, page 479) reports weighted accuracy of 0.614 compared to the lead baselines performance of 0.438 (the numbers are averages over five different summary sizes of 5%, 10%, 15%, 20%, and 25%). In this context we interpret the results in Tables 79 as suggesting that our genrespecific system outperforms the naive baselines and two generic summarizers. 6.4 Evaluating Summaries using Lexical Overlap ROUGE (Lin 2004) is a package for automatically evaluating summaries. Given one or more gold-standard summaries (usually written by people), ROUGE offers several metrics for evaluating the summary in question. The metrics reward lexical overlap between the model summaries and the candidate one. Depending on the metric, the lexical units taken into consideration are n-grams, word sequences, and word pairs. Since 2004, ROUGE scores have been among the measures used for evaluating automatic summarizers at DUC.

As many have remarked on previous occasions (Mani 2001; Radev et al. 2003), co-selection measures do not provide a complete assessment of the quality of a summary. First of all, when a summary in question contains sentences that do not appear in any of the model extracts, one may not be sure that those sentences are uninformative or inappropriate for inclusion in a summary. In addition, documents have internal discourse structure and sentences are often inter-dependent. Therefore, even if a summary contains sen</context>

There is no straightforward way to interpret these results as good or bad in the context of other summarization systems. Firstly, the task is new and no comparable results exist. Secondly, even though sentence co-selection metrics have been widely used for evaluating summaries of other genres, different compression rates, different gold standards, and availability of naturally occurring competitive baselines (e.g., lead baseline in newswire summarization) make fair comparison difficult. For example, Marcu (2000, page 214) reports achieving F-score of 76.04 when creating summaries of newswire articles at 10% of their original length. The lead baseline achieves F-score of 71.89. When summarizing dialogues, Zechner (2002, page 479) reports weighted accuracy of 0.614 compared to the lead baselines performance of 0.438 (the numbers are averages over five different summary sizes of 5%, 10%, 15%, 20%, and 25%).

Fifteen judges evaluated the summaries on a number of extrinsic and intrinsic measures. The outcome of this evaluation suggests that the summaries are helpful in achieving the original objective. 1. Introduction In the last decade, automatic text summarization has become a popular research topic with a curiously restricted scope of applications. A few innovative research directions have emerged, including headline generation (Soricut and Marcu 2007), summarization of books (Mihalcea and Ceylan 2007), personalized summarization (Daz and Gervas 2007), generation of tables-of-contents (Branavan, Deshpande, and Barzilay 2007), summarization of speech (Fuentes et al. 2005), dialogues (Zechner 2002), evaluative text (Carenini, Ng, and Pauls 2006), and biomedical documents (Reeve, Han, and Brooks 2007).

In order to evaluate our summarizer comparatively, we defined two naive baselines and a ceiling. Intuitively, when a person wishes to decide whether to read a book, she opens it and flips through several pages at the beginning. Imitating this process, we computed a simple lead baseline consisting of the first 6% of the sentences in a story. The second baseline consists of 6% of sentences of the story selected at random. The ceiling consists of all sentences deemed summary-worthy by one of the human annotators. 13 We decided against using deeper approaches, such as the Pyramid method (Nenkova and Passonneau 2004), factoids (van Halteren and Teufel 2003), and relative utility (Radev and Tam 2003). The reason is practical: These approaches have an unfortunate disadvantage of being considerably more labor-intensive than the measures based on sentence co-selection. 94 \x0cKazantseva and Szpakowicz Summarizing Short Stories It is also necessary to see whether our genre-specific approach shows any improvements over the existing generic state-of-the-art systems put to work on fiction.

For example, a system called BORIS (Dyer 1983) processed stories word-by-word to create a very rich semantic representation of them using Memory Organization Packets (MOPs) and Thematic Affect Units (TAUs). These knowledge structures were activated by means of a very detailed lexicon where each lexeme was associated with MOPs and TAUs it could invoke. Systems such as BORIS could not process stories that did not conform to schemas already at their disposal. Charniak and Goldman (1988) and Norvig (1989) attempted to circumvent this problem by learning to recognize more general structures. FAUSTUS (Norvig 1989) recognized six general classes of inferences by finding patterns of connectivity in a semantic network. It could be adapted to new kinds of documents by extending its knowledge base and not the underlying algorithm or patterns. Research in automatic story comprehension offered a number of important solutions for subsequent developments in artificial intelligence. No less important, it pointed out a number of challenges.

Much of that line of research relied on an assumption that stories exhibit global cognitive structure (known as macrostructure [van Dijk 1980] or schema [Bartlett 1932]) and that they can be decomposed into a finite number of cognitive units. According to this view, diversity in stories is not due to an infinite number of plots, but to an infinite number of combinations of a (relatively) small number of cognitive units. This direction was pioneered in 1928 by Vladimir Propp (1968) with his detailed analysis of 100 Russian folk tales. After a period of oblivion, these ideas regained popularity: van Dijk and Kintsch (1978) demonstrated the existence of macrostructures and their role in story comprehension and recall; Rumelhart (1975), Thorndyke (1975), and Mandler 2 These systems are GISTexter (Harabagiu, Hickl, and Lacatusu 2007) and CLASSY (Schlesinger, OLeary, and Conroy 2008; Conroy, Schlesinger, and OLeary 2007).

For instance, a fine-grained feature vector has three different features with seven possible values to carry tense-related information: tense, is progressive, and is perfect, whereas a coarse-grained vector carries only one binary feature, is simple past or present.6 Finally, the system selects salient descriptive sentences. Regardless of the granularity of the representation, one may choose between two different procedures for sentence selection. The first procedure employs machine learning techniques, namely the C5.0 decision tree induction (Quinlan 1992). The second procedure applies a set of manually created rules that guide the classification process. Section 4.3 gives a motivation for features used in each data set. Sections 5.15.3 describe the experimental setting. Section 6 presents the results. The part of the system that selects descriptive sentences is implemented in Python. 4.3 Feature Selection: Description and Motivation There are two criteria for the selection of features for both representations: (Criterion 1) a clause should talk about important things, such as characters or locations (Criterion 2) a clause should contain backgr</context>

Once the parameters had been adjusted, the system produced two sets of summaries for the test portion of the corpus (one for each representation). The detailed algorithms for both data sets are too long for inclusion in this article. Figures 7 and 8 show the rationale for the algorithms. The interested reader is referred to Kazantseva (2006) for pseudo-code. 5.3 Experiments with Machine Learning As an alternative to rule construction, in the second set of experiments we performed decision tree induction with C5.0 (Quinlan 1992) to select salient descriptive sentences. C5.0 was our choice mainly because of the readability of its output. The training and test data sets exhibited an almost 1:17 class imbalance (i.e., only 6% of all annotated clauses belonged to the positive class). Because the corpus was rather small, we applied a number of techniques to correct class imbalance in the training data set. These techniques included classification costs, undersampling (randomly removing instances of the majority class), oversampling (randomly duplicating instances of the minority class), and synthetic example generation (C</context>

The ceiling consists of all sentences deemed summary-worthy by one of the human annotators. 13 We decided against using deeper approaches, such as the Pyramid method (Nenkova and Passonneau 2004), factoids (van Halteren and Teufel 2003), and relative utility (Radev and Tam 2003). The reason is practical: These approaches have an unfortunate disadvantage of being considerably more labor-intensive than the measures based on sentence co-selection. 94 \x0cKazantseva and Szpakowicz Summarizing Short Stories It is also necessary to see whether our genre-specific approach shows any improvements over the existing generic state-of-the-art systems put to work on fiction. To this end, we compared our summarizer with two systems that were top performers in the Document Understanding Conference (henceforth DUC) 2007, the annual competition for automatic summarizers.

Fifteen judges evaluated the summaries on a number of extrinsic and intrinsic measures. The outcome of this evaluation suggests that the summaries are helpful in achieving the original objective. 1. Introduction In the last decade, automatic text summarization has become a popular research topic with a curiously restricted scope of applications. A few innovative research directions have emerged, including headline generation (Soricut and Marcu 2007), summarization of books (Mihalcea and Ceylan 2007), personalized summarization (Daz and Gervas 2007), generation of tables-of-contents (Branavan, Deshpande, and Barzilay 2007), summarization of speech (Fuentes et al. 2005), dialogues (Zechner 2002), evaluative text (Carenini, Ng, and Pauls 2006), and biomedical documents (Reeve, Han, and Brooks 2007). In addition, more researchers have been venturing past purely extractive summarization (Krahmer, Marsi, and van Pelt 2008; Nomoto 2007; McDonald 2006).

The anaphora resolution module only handles first and third person singular personal pronouns (I, me, my, he, his...) and singular definite noun phrases that denote animate entities (e.g., the man, but not men). It is implemented in Java, within the GATE framework, using the Connexor Machinese Syntax parser (Tapanainen and Jarvinen 1997). The system resolves anaphoric expressions in the following manner. Initially, the documents are parsed with the Connexor Machinese Syntax parser. The parsed data are then forwarded to the Gazetteer in GATE, which recognizes nouns denoting locations and persons. The original version of the Gazetteer only recognizes named entities and professions, but we extended it to include 137 common animate nouns such as man, woman, soldier, or baby. During the next stage, pronominal anaphoric expressions are 4 The stories used in this exploration were later included in the training part of the data. They</context>

In addition, more researchers have been venturing past purely extractive summarization (Krahmer, Marsi, and van Pelt 2008; Nomoto 2007; McDonald 2006). By and large, however, most research in text summarization still revolves around texts characterized by rigid structure. The better explored among such texts are news articles (Barzilay and McKeown 2005), medical documents (Elhadad et al. 2005), legal documents (Moens 2007), and papers in the area of computer science (Teufel and Moens 2002; Mei and Zhai 2008). Although summarizing these genres is a formidable challenge in itself, it excludes a continually increasing number of informal documents available electronically. Such documents, ranging from novels to personal Web pages, offer a wealth of information that merits the attention of the text summarization community.

The first distinction is between states and events. Events are processes that go on in time and consist of successive phases (Vendler 1967, page 99). For instance, an event of writing an essay consists of writing separate words, correcting, pausing between words, and so on. A state of understanding each other, on the other hand, does not imply such compositionality: It remains unchanged throughout the whole period when it is true. In other words, the meaning of events exhibits a dynamic component, whereas that of states does not. Events are further categorized by whether a particular situation lasts for some time or occurs momentarily. The latter type of events are referred to as achievements, and events that imply duration are </context>

Lexical aspect of a verb. Lexical aspect refers to a property of a verb when viewed in isolation, without regard to the context provided by a particular clause. Just as for clauses, a verb may be a state (or stative) verb (e.g., believe), or an event verb (e.g., run). Event verbs are further subdivided into verbs of activity (e.g., read), accomplishment (e.g., take a test), and achievement (e.g., drop). The relation between the lexical aspect of a verb and the aspect of a clause has been discussed by Vendler (1967), Dorr and Olsen (1997), and Huddleston and Pullum (2002, pages 118123). Dorr and Olsen have proposed a privative model of this relationsee Table 3. The model states that verbs are categorized into aspectual classes based on whether they exhibit one or more of the following properties: dynamicity, durativity, and telicity. Dorr and Olsen speculate that, depending on the context of usage, verbs may form clauses that have more of these properties than the main verb viewed in isolation, but that it is impossible for a verb to shed one of its properties. We illustrate this in Examples 3a and 3b. I</context>

Finally, anaphoric noun phrases are resolved using a modified version of the Lappin and Leass algorithm, adjusted to finding antecedents of nouns. The implementation is described in detail in Kazantseva (2006). A thorough evaluation of the anaphora resolution module would be prohibitively labor-intensive. We estimated the performance of the module by manually verifying the results it achieved on two short stories of the training set (Table 1). The error rates for pronominal anaphora resolution are significantly lower than those for noun phrase anaphora resolution (15.07% vs. 36.84%). This is</context>

Mentions of characters early in the text tend to contain more salient background information. That is why character-related features reflect the position of a parent sentence8 relative to the sentence where the character is introduced. In addition, these features capture the presence of a character mention that is premodified by a noun phrase. The interest in such mentions is inspired by the fact that these constructionsappositionsoften introduce new entities into the discourse (Vieira and Poesio 2000). For the same reasons, the system also establishes whether a character mention is nominal or pronominal (e.g., Jack vs. he), whether it is used in the genitive case (e.g., Jacks) and, for common nouns, whether the mention is accompanied by an indefinite article. 7 It must be mentioned that several researchers have looked into automatically determining various semantic properties of verbs (Siegel 1998b; Merlo et al. 2002). These approaches, however, attempt to determine properties of verbs viewed in isolation and do not deal with particular usages in the context of concrete sentences. That is </context>

Introduction In the last decade, automatic text summarization has become a popular research topic with a curiously restricted scope of applications. A few innovative research directions have emerged, including headline generation (Soricut and Marcu 2007), summarization of books (Mihalcea and Ceylan 2007), personalized summarization (Daz and Gervas 2007), generation of tables-of-contents (Branavan, Deshpande, and Barzilay 2007), summarization of speech (Fuentes et al. 2005), dialogues (Zechner 2002), evaluative text (Carenini, Ng, and Pauls 2006), and biomedical documents (Reeve, Han, and Brooks 2007). In addition, more researchers have been venturing past purely extractive summarization (Krahmer, Marsi, and van Pelt 2008; Nomoto 2007; McDonald 2006). By and large, however, most research in text summarization still revolves around texts characterized by rigid structure. The better explored among such texts are news articles (Barzilay and McKeown 2005), medical documents (Elhadad et al. 2005), legal documents (Moens 2007), and papers in the area of computer science (Teufel and Moens 2002;</context>

Secondly, even though sentence co-selection metrics have been widely used for evaluating summaries of other genres, different compression rates, different gold standards, and availability of naturally occurring competitive baselines (e.g., lead baseline in newswire summarization) make fair comparison difficult. For example, Marcu (2000, page 214) reports achieving F-score of 76.04 when creating summaries of newswire articles at 10% of their original length. The lead baseline achieves F-score of 71.89. When summarizing dialogues, Zechner (2002, page 479) reports weighted accuracy of 0.614 compared to the lead baselines performance of 0.438 (the numbers are averages over five different summary sizes of 5%, 10%, 15%, 20%, and 25%). In this context we interpret the results in Tables 79 as suggesting that our genrespecific system outperforms the naive baselines and two generic summarizers. 6.4 Evaluating Summaries using Lexical Overlap ROUGE (Lin 2004) is a package for automatically evaluating summaries. Given one or more gold-standard summaries (usually written by people), ROUGE offers several metrics for evaluating the summary in que</context>
