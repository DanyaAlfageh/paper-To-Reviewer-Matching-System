We therefore suggest three extensions to the algorithm which are on the one hand possible in the OM setting and on the other hand represent special features of the target discourse type: [1.] We observed that the Stanford Named Entity Recognizer CITATION is superior to the Person detection of the (MUC6 trained) CogNIAC implementation,,
To reproduce the system by CITATION, we substitute the cast and crew list employed by them (see Section 3.2), with a NER component CITATION,,
CITATION do not explain how they extract multiword opinion targets with the dependency paths,,
Furthermore, CITATION do not state whether in their evaluation annotated multiw,,
One aspect regarding the extraction of opinion target - opinion word pairs remains open in CITATION: The dependency paths only identify connections between pairs of single words,,
