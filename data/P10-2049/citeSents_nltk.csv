el sentiment analysis on movie reviews in comparison to documents from other domains: CITATION observes that the movie reviews are hardest to classify since the review authors tend to give information about the storyline of the movie which often contain characterizations, such as bad guy or violent scene.,,

3 Opinion Target Identification 3.1 Dataset Currently the only freely available dataset annotated with opinions including annotated anaphoric opinion targets is a corpus of movie reviews by CITATION.,,
CITATION describe a collection of product reviews in which anaphoric opinion targets are also annotated, but it is not available to the public (yet).,,
CITATION used a subset of the dataset they published (1829 documents), namely 1100 documents, however they do not state which documents comprise this subset used in their evaluation.,,

5.1 Error Analysis When extracting opinions from movie reviews, we observe the same challenge as CITATION: The users often characterize events in the storyline or roles the characters play.,,
This type of algorithm creates many false positives, which are not filtered out by the dependency paths employed in the algorithm by CITATION.,,
CITATION successfully modified the relevance ranking of terms in their documents by replacing anaphora with their antecedents.,,
