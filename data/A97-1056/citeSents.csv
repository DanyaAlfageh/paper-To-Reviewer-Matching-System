 This paper considers two significance tests, the exact conditional test CITATION and the Log-likelihood ratio statistic G2 CITATION, and two information criteria, Akaike\'s Information Criterion (AIC) CITATION and the Bayesian Information Criterion (BIC) CITATION,,
 Because their joint distributions have such closed-form expressions, the parameters can be estimated directly from the training data without the need for an iterative fitting procedure (as is required, for example, to estimate the parameters of maximum entropy models; CITATION),,
 Although there are far fewer decomposable models than log-linear models for a given set of feature variables, it has been shown that they have substantially the same expressive power CITATION,,
