Expectations exist both for verbs and nouns (CITATION; CITATION),,
Attention has mostly been limited to selectional preferences of verbs, which have been used for example for syntactic disambiguation CITATION, word sense disambiguation CITATION and semantic role labeling CITATION,,
Recently, a vectorspaced model of selectional preferences has been proposed that computes the typicality of an argument simply through similarity to previously seen arguments (CITATION; CITATION),,
In linguistics, expectations, in the form of selectional restrictions and selectional preferences, have long been used in semantic theories (CITATION; CITATION), and more recently induced from corpora (CITATION; CITATION),,
