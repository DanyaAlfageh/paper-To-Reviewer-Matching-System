To provide a better starting point for mention detection on the ACE corpora, the Carafe pipeline uses an ACE mention tagger provided by MITRE CITATION,,
Starting out with a chunking pipeline, which uses a classical combination of tagger and chunker, with the Stanford POS tagger CITATION, the YamCha chunker CITATION and the Stanford Named Entity Recognizer CITATION, the desire to use richer syntactic representations led to the development of a parsing pipeline, which uses Charniak and Johnsons reranking parser CITATION to assign POS tags and uses base NPs as chunk equivalents, while also providing syntactic trees that can be used by feature extractors,,
BART also supports using the Berkeley parser CITATION, yielding an easy-to-use Java-only solution,,
