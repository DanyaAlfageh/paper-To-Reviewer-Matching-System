CITATION; CITATION) uses a simpler but non-realistic setting, using pre-identified mentions, and the use of coreference information in summarization or question answering techniques is not as widespread as it could be,,
A number of systems that perform coreference resolution are publicly available, such as GUITAR CITATION, which handles the,,
BART also supports using the Berkeley parser CITATION, yielding an easy-to-use Java-only solution,,

Hopkins workshop on using lexical and encyclopedic knowledge for entity disambiguation, the toolkit was used to extend a reimplementation of the CITATION proposal with a variety of additional syntactic and knowledge-based features, and experiment with alternative resolution processes, preprocessing tools, and classifiers,,
To provide a better starting point for mention detection on the ACE corpora, the Carafe pipeline uses an ACE mention tagger provided by MITRE CITATION,,
However, literature on coreference resolution, if providing a baseline, usually uses the algorithm and feature set of CITATION for this purpose,,
Starting out with a chunking pipeline, which uses a classical combination of tagger and chunker, with the Stanford POS tagger CITATION, the YamCha chunker CITATION and the Stanford Named Entity Recognizer CITATION, the desire to use richer syntactic representations led to the development of a parsing pipeline, which uses Charniak and Johnsons reranking parser CITATION to assign POS tags and uses base NPs as chunk equivalents, while also providing syntactic trees that can be used by feature extractors,,
Using coreference information has been shown to be beneficial in a number of other tasks, including information extraction CITATION, question answering CITATION and summarization CITATION,,
While it is possible to make radical changes in the preprocessing by re-engineering complete pipeline components, it is usually possible to achieve the bulk of the task by simply mixing and matching existing components for preprocessing and feature extraction, which is possible by modifying only configuration settings and an XML11 \x0cBNews NPaper NWire Recl Prec F Recl Prec F Recl Prec F basic feature set 0.594 0.522 0.556 0.663 0.526 0.586 0.608 0.474 0.533 extended feature set 0.607 0.654 0.630 0.641 0.677 0.658 0.604 0.652 0.627 CITATION 0.561 0.763 0.647 0.544 0.797 0.646 0.535 0.775 0.633 : expanded feature set in CITATION; Ng trains on the entire ACE training corpus,,
