Other de-identification systems such as (CITATION; CITATION) use machine learning algorithms to train models and predict new annotations,,
Both CITATION and CITATION use an implementation of Conditional Random Fields (CRF) and a set of learning features based on the morphology of the terms and their context,,
We included three rule-based de-identification approaches: HMS Scrubber CITATION; MeDS CITATION; and MIT deid system (Neamatullah et al., 2008),,
And two systems based on machine learning classifiers: The MITRE Identification Scrubber Toolkit (MIST) CITATION; and The Health Information DE-identification (HIDE) system CITATION,,
66 \x0cRegarding NER systems, we chose the Stanford NER system CITATION, which has reported successful results when detecting person names,,
CITATION developed a deidentification system for pathology reports,,
CITATION described the Medical De-identification System (MeDS),,

66 \x0cRegarding NER systems, we chose the Stanford NER system CITATION, which has reported successful results when detecting person names,,
For these processes, we adapted several cTAKES CITATION components,,
We adapted some of the techniques implemented in (CITATION; CITATION; Neamatullah et al., 2008) to our documents, and developed new patterns,,
We built a machine learning classifier for this task, based on LIBSVM CITATION, a library for Support Vector Machines (SVM), with the RBF (Radial Basis Function) kernel,,

NER has long been studied by the research community and many different approaches have been developed (Tjong Kim Sang and De Meulder, 2003; CITATION),,
One successful and freely available named entity recognizer is the Stanford NER system CITATION, which provides an implementation of linear chain CRF sequence models, coupled with well-engineered feature extractors for NER, and trained with newswire documents,,

2 Background and related work In many aspects de-identification resembles traditional NER tasks CITATION,,
We used a weight of 2 when calculating the F2-measure giving recall more (twice) importance than precision CITATION,,
It implements a fuzzy search based on the Levenshtein (edit distance) algorithm9 CITATION, which has to surpass a similarity threshold in order to produce a match,,
For these processes, we adapted several cTAKES CITATION components,,
We adapted some of the techniques implemented in (CITATION; CITATION; Neamatullah et al., 2008) to our documents, and developed new patterns,,
