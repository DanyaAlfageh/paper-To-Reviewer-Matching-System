66 \x0cRegarding NER systems, we chose the Stanford NER system CITATION, which has reported successful results when detecting person names,,
We included three rule-based de-identification approaches: HMS Scrubber CITATION; MeDS CITATION; and MIT deid system (Neamatullah et al., 2008),,
And two systems based on machine learning classifiers: The MITRE Identification Scrubber Toolkit (MIST) CITATION; and The Health Information DE-identification (HIDE) system CITATION,,
One successful and freely available named entity recognizer is the Stanford NER system CITATION, which provides an implementation of linear chain CRF sequence models, coupled with well-engineered feature extractors for NER, and trained with newswire documents,,
NER has long been studied by the research community and many different approaches have been developed (Tjong Kim Sang and De Meulder, 2003; CITATION),,
