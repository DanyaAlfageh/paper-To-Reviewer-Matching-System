In their pioneering work on automatic evaluation of summary coherence, CITATION provide a correlation analysis between human coherence assessments and (1) semantic relatedness between adjacent sentences and (2) measures that characterize how mentions of the same entity in different syntactic positions are spread across adjacent sentences,,
CITATION and CITATION both show the effectiveness of entity-based coherence in evaluating summaries,,
In addition, we investigate some models of grammaticality CITATION and coherence (CITATION; CITATION; CITATION) from prior work (Sections 3.6 to 3.9),,
To extract these, all summaries were parsed by the Stanford parser CITATION,,

3.9 Entity coherence: CITATION Linguistic theories, and Centering theory CITATION in particular, have hypothesized that the properties of the transition of attention from entities in one sentence to those in the next, play a major role in the determination of local coherence,,
CITATION, inspired by Centering, proposed a method to compute the local coherence of texts on the basis of the sequences of entity mentions appearing in them,,
Validating the results on consecutive years of evaluation is important, as results that hold for the data in one year might not carry over to the next, as happened for example in CITATIONs work,,
Following CITATION, we report summary ranking accuracy as the fraction of correct pairwise rankings in the test set,,

Also included are measures of cohesion between adjacent sentences such as similarity under a latent semantic analysis (LSA) model CITATION, stem and content word overlap, syntactic similarity between adjacent sentences, and use of discourse connectives,,
In addition, first mentions of entities in text introduce the entity into the discourse and so must be informative and properly descriptive (CITATION; CITATION; CITATION),,
We run the Stanford Named Entity Recognizer CITATION and record the number of PERSONs, ORGANIZATIONs, and LOCATIONs,,
In fact, prior work in CITATION found that summaries that have been rewritten so that first mentions of people are informative descriptions and subsequent mentions are replaced with more concise reference forms are overwhelmingly prefe,,
