3.4 Tuning and Evaluation For tuning the parameters of the model, Travatar natively supports minimum error rate training (MERT) CITATION and is extension to hypergraphs CITATION,,
There is also a preliminary implementation of online learning methods such as the structured perceptron algorithm CITATION, and regularized structured SVMs trained using FOBOS CITATION,,
ft and right language model states for syntax-based MT CITATION,,
There are plans to implement more algorithms such as MIRA or AROW CITATION in the near future,,
The Travatar toolkit also provides an evaluation program that can calculate the scores of translation output according to various evaluation measures, and calculate the significance of differences between systems using bootstrap resampling CITATION,,
This tuning can be performed for evaluation measures including BLEU CITATION and RIBES (CITATIONa), with an easily extendable interface that makes it simple to support other measures,,
