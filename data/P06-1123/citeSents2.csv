Each word-to-word link is generated from a separate nonterminal.2 Our measure of alignment complexity is analogous to what CITATION call fanout.3 The least complex alignments on this measure those that can be generated with zero gaps are precisely those that can be generated by an 2 If we imagine that each word is generated from a separate nonterminal as in GCNF (Melamed et al., 2004), then constraint 2 becomes a special case of constraint 1,,
Synchronous parsing with discontinuities is computationally expensive in the worst case, but recently invented data structures make it feasible for typical inputs, as long as the number of gaps allowed per constituent is fixed at a small maximum CITATION,,
More generally, for any positive integer k, it is possible to construct a word alignment that cannot be generated using binary production rules whose nonterminals all have fewer than k gaps CITATION,,
Analogous techniques for tree-structured translation models involve either allowing each nonterminal to generate both terminals and other nonterminals (CITATION; CITATION), or, given a constraining parse tree, to flatten it (CITATION; CITATION; CITATION),,
Our study suggests that there might be some benefits to an alternative approach using discontinuous constituents, as proposed, e.g., by CITATION and CITATION,,
