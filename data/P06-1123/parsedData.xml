<bodyText confidence="0.994161033333333">
Translational equivalence is a mathematical rela-
tion that holds between linguistic expressions with
the same meaning. The most common explicit rep-
resentations of this relation are word alignments
between sentences that are translations of each
other. The complexity of a given word alignment
can be measured by the difficulty of decomposing
it into its atomic units under certain constraints de-
tailed in Section 2. This paper describes a study
of the distribution of alignment complexity in a
variety of bitexts. The study considered word
alignments both in isolation and in combination
with independently generated parse trees for one
or both sentences in each pair. Thus, the study

is relevant to finite-state phrase-based models that
use no parse trees (Koehn et al., 2003), tree-to-
string models that rely on one parse tree (Yamada
and Knight, 2001), and tree-to-tree models that
rely on two parse trees (Groves et al., 2004, e.g.).
The word alignments that are the least complex
on our measure coincide with those that can be
generated by an inversion transduction grammar
(ITG). Following Wu (1997), the prevailing opin-
ion in the research community has been that more
complex patterns of word alignment in real bitexts
are mostly attributable to alignment errors. How-
ever, the experiments in Section 3 show that more
complex patterns occur surprisingly often even in
highly reliable alignments in relatively simple bi-
texts. As discussed in Section 4, these findings
shed new light on why syntactic constraints have
not yet helped to improve the accuracy of statisti-
cal machine translation.
Our study used two kinds of data, each con-
trolling a different confounding variable. First,
we wanted to study alignments that contained as
few errors as possible. So unlike some other stud-
ies (Zens and Ney, 2003; Zhang et al., 2006), we
used manually annotated alignments instead of au-
tomatically generated ones. The results of our ex-
periments on these data will remain relevant re-
gardless of improvements in technology for auto-
matic word alignment.
Second, we wanted to measure how much of
the complexity is not attributable to systematic
translation divergences, both in the languages as
a whole (SVO vs. SOV), and in specific construc-
tions (English not vs. French ne. . . pas). To elim-
inate this source of complexity of translational
equivalence, we used English/English bitexts. We
are not aware of any previous studies of word
alignments in monolingual bitexts.
Even manually annotated word alignments vary
in their reliability. For example, annotators some-
times link many words in one sentence to many

words in the other, instead of making the effort to
tease apart more fine-grained distinctions. A study
of such word alignments might say more about
the annotation process than about the translational
equivalence relation in the data. The inevitable
noise in the data motivated us to focus on lower
bounds, complementary to Fox (2002), who wrote
that her results should be looked on as more of an
upper bound. (p. 307) As explained in Section 3,
we modified all unreliable alignments so that they
cannot increase the complexity measure. Thus, we
arrived at complexity measurements that were un-
derestimates, but reliably so. It is almost certain
that the true complexity of translational equiva-
lence is higher than what we report.

Any translation model can memorize a training
sentence pair as a unit. For example, given a sen-
tence pair like (he left slowly / slowly he left) with
the correct word alignment, a phrase-based trans-
lation model can add a single 3-word biphrase to
its phrase table. However, this biphrase would not
help the model predict translations of the individ-
ual words in it. Thats why phrase-based models
typically decompose such training examples into
their sub-biphrases and remember them too. De-
composing the translational equivalence relations
in the training data into smaller units of knowledge
can improve a models ability to generalize (Zhang
et al., 2006). In the limit, to maximize the chances
of covering arbitrary new data, a model should de-
compose the training data into the smallest pos-
sible units, and learn from them.1 For phrase-
based models, this stipulation implies phrases of
length one. If the model is a synchronous rewrit-
ing system, then it should be able to generate ev-
ery training sentence pair as the yield of a binary-

branching synchronous derivation tree, where ev-
ery word-to-word link is generated by a different
derivation step. For example, a model that uses
production rules could generate the previous ex-
ample using the synchronous productions
(S, S) (X Y / Y X); (X, X) (U V / U V);
(Y, Y) (slowly, slowly); (U, U) (he, he);
and (V, V) (left, left).
A problem arises when this kind of decomposi-
tion is attempted for the alignment in Figure 1(a).
If each link is represented by its own nonterminal,
and production rules must be binary-branching,
then some of the nonterminals involved in gener-
ating this alignment need discontinuities, or gaps.
Figure 1(b) illustrates how to generate the sen-
tence pair and its word alignment in this manner.
The nonterminals X and Y have one discontinuity
each.
More generally, for any positive integer k, it is
possible to construct a word alignment that cannot
be generated using binary production rules whose
nonterminals all have fewer than k gaps (Satta and
Peserico, 2005). Our study measured the com-

ITG. For the rest of the paper, we restrict our atten-
tion to binary derivations, except where explicitly
noted otherwise.
To measure the number of gaps needed to gener-
ate a given word alignment, we used a bottom-up
hierarchical alignment algorithm to infer a binary
synchronous parse tree that was consistent with
the alignment, using as few gaps as possible. A
hierarchical alignment algorithm is a type of syn-
chronous parser where, instead of constraining in-
ferences by the production rules of a grammar, the
constraints come from word alignments and possi-
bly other sources (Wu, 1997; Melamed and Wang,
2005). A bottom-up hierarchical aligner begins
with word-to-word links as constituents, where
some of the links might be to nothing (NULL). It
then repeatedly composes constituents with other
constituents to make larger ones, trying to find a
constituent that covers the entire input.
One of the important design choices in this kind
of study is how to treat multiple links attached to
the same word token. Word aligners, both hu-
man and automatic, are often inconsistent about
whether they intend such sets of links to be dis-
junctive or conjunctive. In accordance with its
focus on lower bounds, the present study treated
them as disjunctive, to give the hierarchical align-
ment algorithm more opportunities to use fewer
gaps. This design decision is one of the main dif-
ferences between our study and that of Fox (2002),
who treated links to the same word conjunctively.
By treating many-to-one links disjunctively, our
measure of complexity ignored a large class of dis-
continuities. Many types of discontinuous con-
stituents exist in text independently of any trans-
lation. Simard et al. (2005) give examples such
as English verb-particle constructions, and the
French negation ne. . . pas. The disparate elements
of such constituents would usually be aligned to
the same word in a translation. However, when

lower bounds would be higher if they accounted
for this kind of discontinuity.

We used two monolingual bitexts and five
bilingual bitexts. The Romanian/English and
Hindi/English data came from Martin et al. (2005).
For Chinese/English and Spanish/English, we
used the data from Ayan et al. (2005). The
French/English data were those used by Mihalcea
and Pedersen (2003). The monolingual bitext la-
beled MTEval in the tables consists of multiple
independent translations from Chinese to English
(LDC, 2002). The other monolingual bitext, la-
beled fiction, consists of two independent trans-
lations from French to English of Jules Vernes
novel 20,000 Leagues Under the Sea, sentence-
aligned by Barzilay and McKeown (2001).
From the monolingual bitexts, we removed all
sentence pairs where either sentence was longer
than 100 words. Table 1 gives descriptive statis-
tics for the remaining data. The table also shows
the upper bound of the 95% confidence intervals
for the coverage rates reported later. The results
of experiments on different bitexts are not directly
comparable, due to the varying genres and sen-
tence lengths.

node in the bilingual derivation tree. These ad-
ditional constraints can thwart attempts at hierar-
chical alignment that might have succeeded oth-
erwise. Figure 2a shows a word alignment and a
parse tree that can be hierarchically aligned with-
out gaps. George and left can be composed in both
sentences into a constituent without crossing any
phrase boundaries in the tree, as can on and Fri-
day. These two constituents can then be composed
to cover the entire sentence pair. On the other
hand, if a constraining tree is applied to the other
sentence as shown in Figure 2b, then the word
alignment and tree constraint conflict. The projec-
tion of the VP is discontinuous in the top sentence,
so the links that it covers cannot be composed into
a constituent without gaps. On the other hand, if a
gap is allowed, then the VP can compose as on Fri-
day . . . left in the top sentence, where the ellipsis
represents a gap. This VP can then compose with
the NP complete a synchronous parse tree. Some
authors have applied constraining parse trees to
both sides of the bitext. The example in Figure 3
can be hierarchically aligned using either one of
the two constraining trees, but gaps are necessary
to align it with both trees.

3.3 Methods
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.99886262295082">
We parsed the English side of each bilingual bitext
and both sides of each English/English bitext us-
ing an off-the-shelf syntactic parser (Bikel, 2004),
which was trained on sections 02-21 of the Penn
English Treebank (Marcus et al., 1993).
Our bilingual bitexts came with manually anno-
tated word alignments. For the monolingual bi-
texts, we used an automatic word aligner based
on a cognate heuristic and a list of 282 function
words compiled by hand. The aligner linked two
words to each other only if neither of them was on
the function word list and their longest common
subsequence ratio (Melamed, 1995) was at least
0.75. Words that were not linked to another word
in this manner were linked to NULL. For the pur-
poses of this study, a word aligned to NULL is
a non-constraint, because it can always be com-
posed without a gap with some constituent that is
adjacent to it on just one side of the bitext. The
number of automatically induced non-NULL links
was lower than what would be drawn by hand.
We modified the word alignments in all bi-
texts to minimize the chances that alignment errors
would lead to an over-estimate of alignment com-
plexity. All of the modifications involved adding
links to NULL. Due to our disjunctive treatment
of conflicting links, the addition of a link to NULL
can decrease but cannot increase the complexity of
an alignment. For example, if we added the links
(cela, NULL) and (NULL, that) to the alignment
in Figure 1, the hierarchical alignment algorithm
could use them instead of the link between cela
and that. It could thus generate the modified align-
ment without using a gap. We added NULL links
in two situations. First, if a subset of the links
in an alignment formed a many-to-many mapping
but did not form a bipartite clique (i.e. every word
on one side linked to every word on the other side),
then we added links from each of these words to
NULL. Second, if n words on one side of the bi-
text aligned to m words on the other side with
m &gt; n then we added NULL links for each of
the words on the side with m words.
After modifying the alignments and obtaining
monolingual parse trees, we measured the align-
ment complexity of each bitext using a hierarchi-
cal alignment algorithm, as described in Section 2.
Separate measurements were taken with zero, one,
and two constraining parse trees. The synchronous
parser in the GenPar toolkit4 can be configured for
all of these cases (Burbank et al., 2005).
Unlike Fox (2002) and Galley et al. (2004), we
measured failure rates per corpus rather than per
sentence pair or per node in a constraining tree.
This design was motivated by the observation that
if a translation model cannot correctly model a cer-
tain word alignment, then it is liable to make incor-
rect inferences about arbitrary parts of that align-
ment, not just the particular word links involved in
a complex pattern. The failure rates we report rep-
resent lower bounds on the fraction of training data

3.4 Summary Results
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999308551724138">
Table 2 shows the lower bound on alignment fail-
ure rates with and without gaps for five languages
paired with English. This table represents the
case where the only constraints are from word
alignments. Wu (1997) has been unable to find
real examples of cases where hierarchical align-
ment would fail under these conditions, at least
in fixed-word-order languages that are lightly in-
flected, such as English and Chinese. (p. 385).
In contrast, we found examples in all bitexts that
could not be hierarchically aligned without gaps,
including at least 5% of the Chinese/English sen-
tence pairs. Allowing constituents with a single
gap on one side of the bitext decreased the ob-
served failure rate to zero for all five bitexts.
Table 3 shows what happened when we used
monolingual parse trees to restrict the composi-
tions on the English side. The failure rates were
above 35% for four of the five language pairs, and
61% for Chinese/English! Again, the failure rate
fell dramatically when one gap was allowed on the
unconstrained (non-English) side of the bitext. Al-
lowing two gaps on the non-English side led to al-
most complete coverage of these word alignments.
Table 3 does not specify the number of gaps al-
lowed on the English side, because varying this pa-
rameter never changed the outcome. The only way
that a gap on that side could increase coverage is if
there was a node in the constraining parse tree that

in one of the complex permutations. The absence
of such cases in the data implies that the failure
rates under the constraints of one parse tree would
be identical even if we allowed production rules of
rank higher than two.
Table 4 shows the alignment failure rates for the
MTEval bitext. With word alignment constraints
only, 3% of the sentence pairs could not be hierar-
chically aligned without gaps. Allowing a single
gap on one side decreased this failure rate to zero.
With a parse tree constraining constituents on one
side of the bitext and with no gaps, alignment fail-
ure rates rose from 3% to 34%, but allowing a
single gap on the side of the bitext that was not
constrained by a parse tree brought the failure rate
back down to 3%. With two constraining trees the
failure rate was 61%, and allowing gaps did not
lower it, for the same reasons that allowing gaps

The trends in the fiction bitext (Table 5) were
similar to those in the MTEval bitext, but the cov-
erage was always higher, for two reasons. First,
the median sentence size was lower in the fiction
bitext. Second, the MTEval translators were in-
structed to translate as literally as possible, but the
fiction translators paraphrased to make the fiction
more interesting. This freedom in word choice re-
duced the frequency of cognates and thus imposed
fewer constraints on the hierarchical alignment,
which resulted in looser estimates of the lower
bounds. We would expect the opposite effect with
hand-aligned data (Galley et al., 2004).

3.5 Detailed Failure Analysis
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.978201733333333">
We examined by hand 30 random sentence pairs
from the MTEval bitext in each of three different
categories: (1) the set of sentence pairs that could
not be hierarchically aligned without gaps, even
without constraining parse trees; (2) the set of sen-
tence pairs that could not be hierarchically aligned
without gaps with one constraining parse tree, but
that did not fall into category 1; and (3) the set
of sentence pairs that could not be hierarchically
aligned without gaps with two constraining parse
trees, but that did not fall into category 1 or 2. Ta-
ble 6 shows the results of this analysis.
In category 1, 60% of the word alignments that
could not be hierarchically aligned without gaps
were caused by word alignment errors. E.g.:

words like targeted and started, which our word
alignment algorithm deemed cognates. 12 of the
hierarchical alignment failures in this category
were true failures. For example:

sion of his trip was to organize an assault on Iraq.
The alignment pattern of the words in bold is
the familiar (3,1,4,2) permutation, as in Figure 1.
Most of the 12 true failures were due to movement
of prepositional phrases. The freedom of move-
ment for such modifiers would be greater in bitexts
that involve languages with less rigid word order
than English.
Of the 30 sentence pairs in category 2, 16 could
not be hierarchically aligned due to parser errors
and 4 due to faulty word alignments. 10 were due
to valid word reordering. In the following exam-
ple, a co-referring pronoun causes the word align-
ment to fail with a constraining tree on the second
sentence:
</bodyText>

<bodyText confidence="0.995612230769231">
Washington, he seemed to change his original stance.
25 of the 30 sentence pairs in category 3 failed
to align due to parser error. 5 examples failed be-
cause of valid word reordering. 1 of the 5 reorder-
ings was due to a difference between active voice
and passive voice, as in Figure 3.
The last row of Table 6 takes the various rea-
sons for alignment failure into account. It esti-
mates what the failure rates would be if the mono-
lingual parses and word alignments were perfect,
with 95% confidence intervals. These revised rates
emphasize the importance of reliable word align-
ments for this kind of study.

Figure 1 came from a real bilingual bitext,
and Example 2 in Section 3.5 came from a
real monolingual bitext.7 Neither of these ex-
amples can be hierarchically aligned correctly
without gaps, even without constraining parse
trees. The received wisdom in the literature
led us to expect no such examples in bilin-
gual bitexts, let alone in monolingual bitexts.
See http://nlp.cs.nyu.edu/GenPar/ACL06 for
more examples. The English/English lower
bounds are very loose, because the automatic word
aligner would not link words that were not cog-
nates. Alignment failure rates on a hand aligned
bitext would be higher. We conclude that the ITG
formalism cannot account for the natural com-
plexity of translational equivalence, even when
translation divergences are factored out.
Perhaps our most surprising results were those
involving one constraining parse tree. These re-
sults explain why constraints from independently
generated monolingual parse trees have not im-
proved statistical translation models. For exam-
ple, Koehn et al. (2003) reported that requiring
constituents to be syntactically motivated does not
lead to better constituent pairs, but only fewer con-
stituent pairs, with loss of a good amount of valu-
able knowledge. This statement is consistent with
our findings. However, most of the knowledge
loss could be prevented by allowing a gap. With
a parse tree constraining constituents on the En-
glish side, the coverage failure rate was 61% for
the Chinese/English bitext (top row of Table 3),
but allowing a gap decreased it to 6%. Zhang and
Gildea (2004) found that their alignment method,
which did not use external syntactic constraints,
outperformed the model of Yamada and Knight
(2001). However, Yamada and Knights model
could explain only the data that would pass the no-
gap test in our experiments with one constraining
tree (first column of Table 3). Zhang and Gildeas
conclusions might have been different if Yamada
and Knights model were allowed to use discon-
tinuous constituents. The second row of Ta-
ble 4 suggests that when constraining parse trees
are used without gaps, at least 34% of training sen-
tence pairs are likely to introduce noise into the
model, even if systematic syntactic differences be-
tween languages are factored out. We should not

be surprised when such constraints do more harm
than good.
To increase the chances that a translation model
can explain complex word alignments, some au-
thors have proposed various ways of extending
a models domain of locality. For example,
Callison-Burch et al. (2005) have advocated for
longer phrases in finite-state phrase-based transla-
tion models. We computed the phrase length that
would be necessary to cover the words involved
in each (3,1,4,2) permutation in the MTEval bi-
text. Figure 5 shows the cumulative percentage of
these cases that would be covered by phrases up to
a certain length. Only 9 of the 171 cases (5.2%)
could be covered by phrases of length 10 or less.
Analogous techniques for tree-structured transla-
tion models involve either allowing each nonter-
minal to generate both terminals and other non-
terminals (Groves et al., 2004; Chiang, 2005), or,
given a constraining parse tree, to flatten it (Fox,
2002; Zens and Ney, 2003; Galley et al., 2004).
Both of these approaches can increase coverage of
the training data, but, as explained in Section 2,
they risk losing generalization ability.
Our study suggests that there might be some
benefits to an alternative approach using discontin-
uous constituents, as proposed, e.g., by Melamed
et al. (2004) and Simard et al. (2005). The large
differences in failure rates between the first and
second columns of Table 3 are largely indepen-
dent of the tightness of our lower bounds. Syn-
chronous parsing with discontinuities is computa-
tionally expensive in the worst case, but recently
invented data structures make it feasible for typi-
cal inputs, as long as the number of gaps allowed
per constituent is fixed at a small maximum (Wax-
monsky and Melamed, 2006). More research is
needed to investigate the trade-off between these
costs and benefits.

</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999872">
This paper presented evidence of phenomena that
can lead to complex patterns of translational
equivalence in bitexts of any language pair. There
were surprisingly many examples of such patterns
that could not be analyzed using binary-branching
structures without discontinuities. Regardless of
the languages involved, the translational equiva-
lence relations in most real bitexts of non-trivial
size cannot be generated by an inversion trans-
duction grammar. The low coverage rates without
gaps under the constraints of independently gen-
erated monolingual parse trees might be the main
reason why syntactic constraints have not yet in-
creased the accuracy of SMT systems. Allowing a
single gap in bilingual phrases or other types of
constituent can improve coverage dramatically.

<abstract confidence="0.997765842105263">This paper describes a study of the patterns of translational equivalence exhibited by a variety of bitexts. The study found that the complexity of these patterns in every bitext was higher than suggested in the literature. These findings shed new light on why syntactic constraints have not helped to improve statistical translation models, including finitestate phrase-based models, tree-to-string models, and tree-to-tree models. The paper also presents evidence that inversion transduction grammars cannot generate some translational equivalence relations, even in relatively simple real bitexts in syntactically similar languages with rigid word order.

Second, if n words on one side of the bitext aligned to m words on the other side with m &gt; n then we added NULL links for each of the words on the side with m words. After modifying the alignments and obtaining monolingual parse trees, we measured the alignment complexity of each bitext using a hierarchical alignment algorithm, as described in Section 2. Separate measurements were taken with zero, one, and two constraining parse trees. The synchronous parser in the GenPar toolkit4 can be configured for all of these cases (Burbank et al., 2005). Unlike Fox (2002) and Galley et al. (2004), we measured failure rates per corpus rather than per sentence pair or per node in a constraining tree. This design was motivated by the observation that if a translation model cannot correctly model a certain word alignment, then it is liable to make incorrect inferences about arbitrary parts of that alignment, not just the particular word links involved in a complex pattern. The failure rates we report represent lower bounds on the fraction of training data 4 http://nlp.cs.nyu.edu/GenPar 980 \x0c# of gaps allowed 0/0 0/1 or 1/0 Chinese/English 26 </context>

A study of such word alignments might say more about the annotation process than about the translational equivalence relation in the data. The inevitable noise in the data motivated us to focus on lower bounds, complementary to Fox (2002), who wrote that her results should be looked on as more of an upper bound. (p. 307) As explained in Section 3, we modified all unreliable alignments so that they cannot increase the complexity measure. Thus, we arrived at complexity measurements that were underestimates, but reliably so. It is almost certain that the true complexity of translational equivalence is higher than what we report. 2 A Measure of Alignment Complexity Any translation model can memorize a training sentence pair as a unit.

One of the important design choices in this kind of study is how to treat multiple links attached to the same word token. Word aligners, both human and automatic, are often inconsistent about whether they intend such sets of links to be disjunctive or conjunctive. In accordance with its focus on lower bounds, the present study treated them as disjunctive, to give the hierarchical alignment algorithm more opportunities to use fewer gaps. This design decision is one of the main differences between our study and that of Fox (2002), who treated links to the same word conjunctively. By treating many-to-one links disjunctively, our measure of complexity ignored a large class of discontinuities. Many types of discontinuous constituents exist in text independently of any translation. Simard et al. (2005) give examples such as English verb-particle constructions, and the French negation ne. . . pas.

First, the median sentence size was lower in the fiction bitext. Second, the MTEval translators were instructed to translate as literally as possible, but the fiction translators paraphrased to make the fiction more interesting. This freedom in word choice reduced the frequency of cognates and thus imposed fewer constraints on the hierarchical alignment, which resulted in looser estimates of the lower bounds.

The English/English lower bounds are very loose, because the automatic word aligner would not link words that were not cognates. Alignment failure rates on a hand aligned bitext would be higher. We conclude that the ITG formalism cannot account for the natural complexity of translational equivalence, even when translation divergences are factored out. Perhaps our most surprising results were those involving one constraining parse tree. These results explain why constraints from independently generated monolingual parse trees have not improved statistical translation models. For example, Koehn et al. (2003) reported that requiring constituents to be syntactically motivated does not lead to better constituent pairs, but only fewer constituent pairs, with loss of a good amount of valuable knowledge. This statement is consistent with our findings. However, most of the knowledge loss could be prevented by allowing a gap. With a parse tree constraining constituents on the English side, the coverage failure rate was 61% for the Chinese/English bitext (top row of Table 3), but allowing a gap decreased it to 6%.

For the rest of the paper, we restrict our attention to binary derivations, except where explicitly noted otherwise. To measure the number of gaps needed to generate a given word alignment, we used a bottom-up hierarchical alignment algorithm to infer a binary synchronous parse tree that was consistent with the alignment, using as few gaps as possible. A hierarchical alignment algorithm is a type of synchronous parser where, instead of constraining inferences by the production rules of a grammar, the constraints come from word alignments and possibly other sources (Wu, 1997; Melamed and Wang, 2005). A bottom-up hierarchical aligner begins with word-to-word links as constituents, where some of the links might be to nothing (NULL). It then repeatedly composes constituents with other constituents to make larger ones, trying to find a constituent that covers the entire input. One of the important design choices in this kind of study is how to treat multiple links attached to the same word token. Word aligners, both human and automatic, are often inconsistent about whether they intend such sets of links to be disjunctive or conjunctive.

If each link is represented by its own nonterminal, and production rules must be binary-branching, then some of the nonterminals involved in generating this alignment need discontinuities, or gaps. Figure 1(b) illustrates how to generate the sentence pair and its word alignment in this manner. The nonterminals X and Y have one discontinuity each. More generally, for any positive integer k, it is possible to construct a word alignment that cannot be generated using binary production rules whose nonterminals all have fewer than k gaps (Satta and Peserico, 2005). Our study measured the complexity of a word alignment as the minimum number of gaps needed to generate it under the following constraints: 1. Each step of the derivation generates no more than two different nonterminals. 2. Each word-to-word link is generated from a separate nonterminal.2 Our measure of alignment complexity is analogous to what Melamed et al.

In accordance with its focus on lower bounds, the present study treated them as disjunctive, to give the hierarchical alignment algorithm more opportunities to use fewer gaps. This design decision is one of the main differences between our study and that of Fox (2002), who treated links to the same word conjunctively. By treating many-to-one links disjunctively, our measure of complexity ignored a large class of discontinuities. Many types of discontinuous constituents exist in text independently of any translation. Simard et al.

Analogous techniques for tree-structured translation models involve either allowing each nonterminal to generate both terminals and other nonterminals (Groves et al., 2004; Chiang, 2005), or, given a constraining parse tree, to flatten it (Fox, 2002; Zens and Ney, 2003; Galley et al., 2004). Both of these approaches can increase coverage of the training data, but, as explained in Section 2, they risk losing generalization ability.

For the rest of the paper, we restrict our attention to binary derivations, except where explicitly noted otherwise. To measure the number of gaps needed to generate a given word alignment, we used a bottom-up hierarchical alignment algorithm to infer a binary synchronous parse tree that was consistent with the alignment, using as few gaps as possible. A hierarchical alignment algorithm is a type of synchronous parser where, instead of constraining inferences by the production rules of a grammar, the constraints come from word alignments and possibly other sources (Wu, 1997; Melamed and Wang, 2005). A bottom-up hierarchical aligner begins with word-to-word links as constituents, where some of the links might be to nothing (NULL). It then repeatedly composes constituents with other constituents to make larger ones, trying to find a constituent that covers the entire input. One of the important design choices in this kind of study is how to treat multiple links attached to the same word token. Word aligners, both human and automatic, are often inconsistent about whether they intend such sets of links to be disjunctive or conjunctive. In accordance with its focus o</context>

This table represents the case where the only constraints are from word alignments. Wu (1997) has been unable to find real examples of cases where hierarchical alignment would fail under these conditions, at least in fixed-word-order languages that are lightly inflected, such as English and Chinese. (p. 385). In contrast, we found examples in all bitexts that could not be hierarchically aligned without gaps, including at least 5% of the Chinese/English sentence pairs. Allowing constituents with a single gap on one side of the bitext decreased the observed failure rate to zero for all five bitexts.

However, this biphrase would not help the model predict translations of the individual words in it. Thats why phrase-based models typically decompose such training examples into their sub-biphrases and remember them too. Decomposing the translational equivalence relations in the training data into smaller units of knowledge can improve a models ability to generalize (Zhang et al., 2006). In the limit, to maximize the chances of covering arbitrary new data, a model should decompose the training data into the smallest possible units, and learn from them.1 For phrasebased models, this stipulation implies phrases of length one.
