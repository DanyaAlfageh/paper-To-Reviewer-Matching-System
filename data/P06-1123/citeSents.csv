For example, CITATION have advocated for longer phrases in finite-state phrase-based translation models,,
The inevitable noise in the data motivated us to focus on lower bounds, complementary to CITATION, who wrote that her results should be looked on as more of an upper bound,,
Each word-to-word link is generated from a separate nonterminal.2 Our measure of alignment complexity is analogous to what CITATION call fanout.3 The least complex alignments on this measure those that can be generated with zero gaps are precisely those that can be generated by an 2 If we imagine that each word is generated from a separate nonterminal as in GCNF (Melamed et al., 2004), then constraint 2 becomes a special case of constraint 1,,
CITATION give examples such as English verb-particle constructions, and the French negation ne,,
More generally, for any positive integer k, it is possible to construct a word alignment that cannot be generated using binary production rules whose nonterminals all have fewer than k gaps CITATION,,
For Chinese/English and Spanish/English, we used the data from CITATION,,
Our study suggests that there might be some benefits to an alternative approach using discontinuous constituents, as proposed, e.g., by CITATION and CITATION,,
Each word-to-word link is generated from a separate nonterminal.2 Our measure of alignment complexity is analogous to what CITATION call fanout.3 The least complex alignments on this measure those that can be generated with zero gaps are precisely those that can be generated by an 2 If we imagine that each word is generated from a separate nonterminal as in G,,
Analogous techniques for tree-structured translation models involve either allowing each nonterminal to generate both terminals and other nonterminals (CITATION; CITATION), or, given a constraining parse tree, to flatten it (CITATION; CITATION; CITATION),,
Decomposing the translational equivalence relations in the training data into smaller units of knowledge can improve a models ability to generalize CITATION,,
We would expect the opposite effect with hand-aligned data CITATION,,
Synchronous parsing with discontinuities is computationally expensive in the worst case, but recently invented data structures make it feasible for typical inputs, as long as the number of gaps allowed per constituent is fixed at a small maximum CITATION,,
The Romanian/English and Hindi/English data came from CITATION,,
This design decision is one of the main differences between our study and that of CITATION, who treated links to the same word conjunctively,,
Unlike CITATION and CITATION, we measured failure rates per corpus rather than per sentence pair or per node in a constraining tree,,
ethods We parsed the English side of each bilingual bitext and both sides of each English/English bitext using an off-the-shelf syntactic parser (Bikel, 2004), which was trained on sections 02-21 of the Penn English Treebank CITATION,,
For example, CITATION reported that requiring constituents to be syntactically motivated does not lead to better constituent pairs, but only fewer constituent pairs, with loss of a good amount of valuable knowledge,,
The monolingual bitext labeled MTEval in the tables consists of multiple independent translations from Chinese to English CITATION,,
CITATION found that their alignment method, which did not use external syntactic constraints, outperformed the model of CITATION,,
CITATION has been unable to find real examples of cases where hierarchical alignment would fail under these conditions, at least in fixed-word-order languages that are lightly inflected, such as English and Chinese,,
is relevant to finite-state phrase-based models that use no parse trees CITATION, tree-tostring models that rely on one parse tree CITATION, and tree-to-tree models that rely on two parse trees (CITATION, e.g.),,
CITATION found that their alignment method, which did not use external syntac,,
The French/English data were those used by CITATION,,
xample, CITATION have advocated for longer phrases in finite-state phrase-based translation models,,
The aligner linked two words to each other only if neither of them was on the function word list and their longest common subsequence ratio CITATION was at least 0.75,,
A hierarchical alignment algorithm is a type of synchronous parser where, instead of constraining inferences by the production rules of a grammar, the constraints come from word alignments and possibly other sources (CITATION; CITATION),,
3.3 Methods We parsed the English side of each bilingual bitext and both sides of each English/English bitext using an off-the-shelf syntactic parser (Bikel, 2004), which was trained on sections 02-21 of the Penn English Treebank CITATION,,
The synchronous parser in the GenPar toolkit4 can be configured for all of these cases CITATION,,
So unlike some other studies (CITATION; CITATION), we used manually annotated alignments instead of automatically generated ones,,
Following CITATION, the prevailing opinion in the research community has been that more complex patterns of word alignment in real bitexts are mostly attributable to alignment errors,,
The other monolingual bitext, labeled fiction, consists of two independent translations from French to English of Jules Vernes novel 20,000 Leagues Under the Sea, sentencealigned by CITATION,,
Analogous techniques for tree-structured translation models involve either allowing each nonterminal to generate both terminals and other nonterminals (CITATION; CITATION), ,,
