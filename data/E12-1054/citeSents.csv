 the quality of the optical character recognition module CITATION,,
 Existing measures of contextual fitness can be categorized into knowledge-based CITATION and statistical methods (Mays et al,,
, 1991; CITATION),,
 For that purpose, knowledge-based approaches employ the structural knowledge encoded in lexical-semantic networks like WordNet CITATION, while statistical approaches rely on co-occurrence counts collected from large corpora, e,,
 the Google Web1T corpus CITATION,,
, 1991; CITATION) which are created by taking a sentence that is known to be correct, and replacing a word with a similar word from the vocabulary,,
 Thus, we use a frequency filter based on the Google Web1T n-gram counts CITATION,,
 For this purpose, we applied the Stanford NER CITATION,,
006) used a characteristic gap in the standard evaluation dataset by CITATION that separates unrelated from related word pairs,,
1 Statistical Approach Table 1 summarizes the results obtained by the statistical approach using a trigram model based on the Google Web1T data CITATION,,
 Another possible source of real-word spelling errors are learner corpora CITATION, e,,
 the Cambridge Learner Corpus CITATION,,
 However, annotation of errors is difficult and costly CITATION, only a small fraction of observed errors will be real-word spelling errors, and learners are likely to make dif535 \x0cferent mistakes than proficient language users,,
 CITATION presented another statistical approach using the Google Web1T data CITATION to create the n-gram model,,
 (1991), CITATION found that it ou,,

 Some measures using a wider definition of semantic relatedness (CITATION; CITATIONb) instead of only using taxonomic relations in a knowledge source,,
 CITATION used a characteristic gap in the standard evaluation dataset by Rube,,
 Influence of the Relatedness Measure As was pointed out before, CITATION 534 \x0cDataset Measure P R F Art-En JiangConrath 0,,
 show that the measure by CITATION yields the best results in their experiments on malapropism detection,,
 However, real-word spelling correction has also been tackled by supervised approaches (CITATION; CITATION; CITATION),,

 In addition, we test another path-based measure by CITATION, the gloss-based measure by CITATION, and the ESA measure CITATION based on concept vectors from Wikipedia, Wiktionary, and WordNet,,
 In contrast to the findings of CITATION, JiangConrath is not the best path-based measure, as Lin provides equal or better performance,,
 However, real-word spelling correction has also been tackled by supervised approaches (CITATION; CITATION; CITATION),,
 CITATION used similar techniques to create a dataset of errors from the French Wikipedia,,

 Besides typing mistakes, a major source of such errors is the failed attempt of automatic spelling correctors to correct a misspelled word CITATION,,

2 Knowledge Based Approach CITATION introduced a knowledge-based approach that detects real-word spelling errors by checking the semantic relations of a target word with its context,,
 (1991), CITATION found that it outperformed the knowledge-based method by CITATION when evaluated on a corpus of artificial errors based on the WSJ corpus,,
 (1991) and the knowledge-based approach by CITATION on the task of detecting realword spelling errors,,
