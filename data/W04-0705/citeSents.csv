Other systems have made a second tagging pass which uses information on token sequences tagged in the first pass (Borthwick 1999), or have used as features information about features assigned to other instances of the same token CITATION,,

The PER context words are generated from the context patterns described in CITATION,,
CITATION used a similar method to identify good candidates for tagging in an active learner,,

In particular, most of these methods classify an instance of a name based on the information about that instance alone, and very local context of that instance typically, one or 1 The best results reported for Chinese named entity recognition, on the MET-2 test corpus, are 0.92 to 0.95 F-measure for the different name types CITATION,,
Usually people adopt a separate list of abbreviations or design separate rules CITATION to identify them,,
We have used the MUC coreference scoring metric CITATION to evaluate this resolver, excluding all pronouns and limiting ourselves to noun phrases of semantic type PER, ORG, and GPE,,
