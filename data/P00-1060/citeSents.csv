Many probabilistic evaluation models have been published inspired by one or more of these feature types [Black, 1992] [Briscoe, 1993] [Charniak, 1997] [Collins, 1996] [CITATION] [CITATION] [CITATION], but discrepancies between training sets, algorithms, and hardware environments make it difficult, if not impossible, to compare the models objectively,,
1 Introduction In the field of statistical parsing, various probabilistic evaluation models have been proposed where different models use different feature types [Black, 1992] [Briscoe, 1993] [Brown, 1991] [Charniak, 1997] [Collins, 1996] [CITATION] [Magerman, 1991] [Magerman, 1992] [CITATION] [CITATION],,
