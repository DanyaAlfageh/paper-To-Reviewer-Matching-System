The approach is inspired by results from CITATION, which show discriminative classifiers can improve the ranking of parses produced by a generative parser,,
CITATION show that using accurate confidence estimation reduces error rates by 46%,,
Third, confidence estimates can improve performance of data mining algorithms that depend upon databases created by information extraction systems CITATION,,
In this work we use conditional random fields CITATION, a type of undirected graphical model, to automatically label fields of contact records,,
2 Conditional Random Fields Conditional random fields CITATION are undirected graphical models to calculate the conditional probability of values on designated output nodes given values on designated input ,,
CITATION show that using accurate confidence estimation reduces error rates by 46%,,
Third, confidence estimates can improve performance of data mining algorithms that depend upon databases created by information extraction systems CITATION,,
