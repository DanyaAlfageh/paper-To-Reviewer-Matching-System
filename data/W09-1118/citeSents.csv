The texts used are part of the MUC-7 corpus (Linguistic Data CITATION) and consists of 100 documents, 3,480 sentences, and 90,790 tokens,,
Each token is represented using a fairly standard menagerie of features, including such stemming from the surface appearance of the token (e.g., Contains dollar? Length in characters), calculated based on linguistic pre-processing made with the English Functional Dependency Grammar CITATION (e.g., Case, Part-of-speech), fetched from precompiled lists of,,

The definition of our intrinsic stopping criterion for committee-based AL builds on the notions of Selection Agreement CITATION, and Validation Set Agreement CITATION,,
Furthermore, while it was claimed in CITATION that one can observe the classifier convergence from the VSA curve (as it approximated the progression of the learning curve), that requires a threshold to be specified for the actual stopping point,,
ch token is represented using a fairly standard menagerie of features, including such stemming from the surface appearance of the token (e.g., Contains dollar? Length in characters), calculated based on linguistic pre-processing made with the English Functional Dependency Grammar CITATION (e.g., Case, Part-of-speech), fetched from precompiled lists of information (e.g., Is first name?), and features based on predictions concerning the context of the token (e.g, Class of previous token),,
We have shown before CITATION that MEs are well apt as selectors with the advantage of much shorter training times than CRFs,,
In this sense, the ISC may serve as a complement to stopping criteria requiring the classifier to achieve absolute performance measures before the learning process is aborted, for instance the max-confidence proposed by CITATION, and the minimal absolute performance introduced by CITATION,,
Zhu and colleagues (CITATION; CITATIONa; CITATIONb) introduce max-confidence, min-error, minimum expected error strategy, overall-uncertainty, and classificationchange as means to terminate AL,,

In relation to the stopping criterion based solely on SA proposed by CITATION, the above defined criterion comes into effect earlier in the AL process,,

Our experimental setting is based on the AL approach described by CITATION: The committee consists of k = 3 Maximum Entropy (ME) classifiers CITATION,,
Each token is represented using a fairly standard menagerie of features, including such stemming from the surface appearance of the token (e.g., Contains dollar? Length in characters), calculated based on linguistic pre-processing made with the English Functional Dependency Grammar CITATION (e.g., Case, Part-of-speech), fetched from precompiled lists of information (e.g., Is first name?), and features based on predictions concerning the context of the token (e.g, Class of previous token),,
In AL, the performance of the classifier cannot be reliably estimated using the data labeled in the process since sampling strategies for estimating performance assume independently and identically distributed examples CITATION,,
While we made use of ME classifiers during the selection, we employed an NE tagger based on Conditional Random Fields (CRF) CITATION during evaluation time to determine the learning curves,,
This experiment concerns a method of orchestrating AL in a way beneficial for the bootstrapping of annotated data CITATION,,
Examples of AL used in language engineering include named entity recognition (CITATION; CITATION), text categorization (CITATION; CITATION), part-of-speech tagging CITATION, and parsing (CITATION; CITATION),,
The task is approached using the IOB tagging scheme proposed by, e.g., CITATION, turning the original 7-class task into a 15-class task,,
Each classifier is created by the REPTree decision tree learner described by CITATION,,
The work most related to ours is that of Tomanek and colleagues (CITATION; CITATION) who define and evaluate the Selection Agreement (SA) and the Validation Set Agreement (VSA) already introduced in Section 2,,

The decision committee is made up from 10 boosted decision trees using MultiBoostAB CITATION (cf,,
CITATION suggests to use classifier confidence to define a stopping criterion for uncertaintybased sampling,,
In all experiments, the agreement among the decision committee members is quantified by the Vote Entropy measure CITATION: V E(e) = 1 log k X l V (l, e) k log V (l, e) k (1) where k is the number of members in the committee, and V (l, e) is the number of members assigning label l to instance e,,
