Our experimental setting is based on the AL approach described by CITATION: The committee consists of k = 3 Maximum Entropy (ME) classifiers CITATION,,
In all experiments, the agreement among the decision committee members is quantified by the Vote Entropy measure CITATION: V E(e) = 1 log k X l V (l, e) k log V (l, e) k (1) where k is the number of members in the committee, and V (l, e) is the number of members assigning label l to instance e,,

While we made use of ME classifiers during the selection, we employed an NE tagger based on Conditional Random Fields (CRF) CITATION during evaluation time to determine the learning curves,,
We have shown before CITATION that MEs are well apt as selectors with the advantage of much shorter training times than CRFs,,
CITATION investigate three ways of terminating uncertainty-based AL for named entity recognition minimal absolute performance, maximum possible performance, and convergence,,
In this sense, the ISC may serve as a complement to stopping criteria requiring the classifier to achieve absolute performance measures before the learning process is aborted, for instance the max-confidence proposed by CITATION, and the minimal absolute performance introduced by CITATION,,

The texts used are part of the MUC-7 corpus (Linguistic Data CITATION) and consists of 100 documents, 3,480 sentences, and 90,790 tokens,,
The task is approached using the IOB tagging scheme proposed by, e.g., CITATION, turning the original 7-class task into a 15-class task,,
Each token is represented using a fairly standard menagerie of features, including such stemming from the surface appearance of the token (e.g., Contains dollar? Length in characters), calculated based on linguistic pre-processing made with the English Functional Dependency Grammar CITATION (e.g., Case, Part-of-speech), fetched from precompiled lists of,,

Furthermore, while it was claimed in CITATION that one can observe the classifier convergence from the VSA curve (as it approximated the progression of the learning curve), that requires a threshold to be specified for the actual stopping point,,

In AL, the performance of the classifier cannot be reliably estimated using the data labeled in the process since sampling strategies for estimating performance assume independently and identically distributed examples CITATION,,
