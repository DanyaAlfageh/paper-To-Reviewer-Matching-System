We introduce a confidence tuning approach on the predicted results through a comparison between the observed category and the predicted category which is similar to the thresholding approach described in CITATION,,

CITATION invite a meta-learning approach and show its effectiveness,,
CITATION introduce an alternating structure optimization based approach,,
Besides, CITATION propose a method to correct verb form errors through combining the features of parse trees and n-gram counts,,
In these cases, the verb form is only related to some specific features as described by CITATION,,
