Detailed evaluations are reported in CITATION,,
It is described in detail in CITATION,,
In Dependency Grammar, this device is also known as lifting (CITATION; CITATION),,
We have developed a parsing system that explores this space, in the vein of systems like CITATION, using a linguistic competence grammar and a probabilistic performance disambiguation allowing us to explore interactions between lexicon and grammar CITATION,,
(Collins, 1999; CITATION)) and formal grammar-ba,,
We have achieved average results in the CoNLL domain adaptation track open submission (CITATION; CITATION; CITATION; CITATION; Brown, ,,
We use a hand-written competence grammar, combined with performance-driven disambiguation obtained from the Penn Treebank CITATION,,
It has been applied to many tasks, such as parsing biomedical literature (CITATION; CITATION) and the whole British National Corpus, and has been evaluated in several ways,,
We have argued in CITATION that LFG f-structures can be parsed for in a completely context-free fashion, except for embedded WH-questions, where a device such as functional uncertainty CITATION or the equivalent Tree-Adjoining Grammar Adjoining operation CITATION is used,,
(Collins, 1999; CITATION)) and,,
lick et al., 2004; CITATION; Brown, 1973),,
We have thus used the collocation extraction tool XTRACT CITATION to discover collocations from large domain corpora,,
We have achieved average results in the CoNLL domain adaptation track open submission (CITATION; CITATION; CITATION; CITATION; Brown, 1973),,
(CITATION; CITATION)),,
Since the tagging quality of the Chemistry testset is high, the impact of multi-word term recognition was lower than the biomedical domain when using a standard tagger, as we have shown in CITATION,,
(Collins, 1999; CITATION)) and formal grammar-based parsers integrating statistics (e.g,,
tail in CITATION,,
