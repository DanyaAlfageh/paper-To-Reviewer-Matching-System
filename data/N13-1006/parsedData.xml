Different languages contain complementary
cues about entities, which can be used to im-
prove Named Entity Recognition (NER) sys-
tems. We propose a method that formu-
lates the problem of exploring such signals on
unannotated bilingual text as a simple Inte-
ger Linear Program, which encourages entity
tags to agree via bilingual constraints. Bilin-
gual NER experiments on the large OntoNotes
4.0 Chinese-English corpus show that the pro-
posed method can improve strong baselines
for both Chinese and English. In particular,
Chinese performance improves by over 5%
absolute F1 score. We can then annotate a
large amount of bilingual text (80k sentence
pairs) using our method, and add it as up-
training data to the original monolingual NER
training corpus. The Chinese model retrained
on this new combined dataset outperforms the
strong baseline by over 3% F1 score.

1 Introduction

<bodyText confidence="0.996351422222222">
Named Entity Recognition (NER) is an important
task for many applications, such as information ex-
traction and machine translation. State-of-the-art su-
pervised NER methods require large amounts of an-
notated data, which are difficult and expensive to
produce manually, especially for resource-poor lan-
guages.
A promising approach for improving NER per-
formance without annotating more data is to exploit
unannotated bilingual text (bitext), which are rela-
tively easy to obtain for many language pairs, bor-
rowing from the resources made available by statis-
tical machine translation research.1 Different lan-
guages contain complementary cues about entities.
For example, in Figure 1, the word (Ben) is
common in Chinese but rarely appears as a trans-
lated foreign name. However, its aligned word on
the English side (Ben) provides a strong clue that
this is a person name. Judicious use of this type of
bilingual cues can help to recognize errors a mono-
lingual tagger would make, allowing us to produce
more accurately tagged bitext. Each side of the
tagged bitext can then be used to expand the orig-
inal monolingual training dataset, which may lead
to higher accuracy in the monolingual taggers.
Previous work such as Li et al. (2012) and Kim
et al. (2012) demonstrated that bilingual corpus an-
notated with NER labels can be used to improve
monolingual tagger performance. But a major draw-
back of their approaches are the need for manual
annotation efforts to create such corpora. To avoid
this requirement, Burkett et al. (2010) suggested a
multi-view learning scheme based on re-ranking.
Noisy output of a strong tagger is used as training
data to learn parameters of a log-linear re-ranking
model with additional bilingual features, simulated
by a weak tagger. The learned parameters are then
reused with the strong tagger to re-rank its own
outputs for unseen inputs. Designing good weak
taggers so that they complement the view of bilin-
gual features in the log-linear re-ranker is crucial to
the success of this algorithm. Unfortunately there is
no principled way of designing such weak taggers.
In this paper, we would like to explore a conceptu-
ally much simpler idea that can also take advantage

of the large amount of unannotated bitext, without
complicated machinery. More specifically, we in-
troduce a joint inference method that formulates the
bilingual NER tagging problem as an Integer Linear
Program (ILP) and solves it during decoding. We
propose a set of intuitive and effective bilingual con-
straints that encourage NER results to agree across
the two languages.
Experimental results on the OntoNotes 4.0 named
entity annotated Chinese-English parallel corpus
show that the proposed method can improve the
strong Chinese NER baseline by over 5% F1 score
and also give small improvements over the English
baseline. Moreover, by adding the automatically
tagged data to the original NER training corpus
and retraining the monolingual model using an up-
training regimen (Petrov et al., 2010), we can im-
prove the monolingual Chinese NER performance
by over 3% F1 score.

2 Constraint-based Monolingual NER
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.965412461538461">
NER is a sequence labeling task where we assign
a named entity tag to each word in an input sen-
tence. One commonly used tagging scheme is the
BIO scheme. The tag B-X (Begin) represents the
first word of a named entity of type X, for example,
PER (Person) or LOC (Location). The tag I-X (In-
side) indicates that a word is part of an entity but not
first word. The tag O (Outside) is used for all non-
entity words.2 See Figure 1 for an example tagged
sentence.
Conditional Random Fields (CRF) (Lafferty et al.,
2001) is a state-of-the-art sequence labeling model
widely used in NER. A first-order linear-chain CRF

<bodyText confidence="0.992543846153846">
where x and y are the input and output sequences,
respectively, Z(x) is the partition function, and Mi
is the clique potential for edge clique i. Decoding
in CRF involves finding the most likely output se-
quence that maximizes this objective, and is com-
monly done by the Viterbi algorithm.
Roth and Yih (2005) proposed an ILP inference
algorithm, which can capture more task-specific and
global constraints than the vanilla Viterbi algorithm.
Our work is inspired by Roth and Yih (2005). But
instead of directly solving the shortest-path problem
in the ILP formulation, we re-define the conditional
probability as:
</bodyText>
<equation confidence="0.999931">
PMAR(y|x) =
Y
i
P(yi|x) (2)
</equation>
<bodyText confidence="0.987082888888889">
where P(yi|x) is the marginal probability given by
an underlying CRF model computed using forward-
backward inference. Since the early HMM litera-
ture, it has been well known that using the marginal
distributions at each position works well, as opposed
to Viterbi MAP sequence labeling (Merialdo, 1994).
Our experimental results also supports this claim, as
we will show in Section 6. Our objective is to find
an optimal NER tag sequence:
</bodyText>
<equation confidence="0.99894975">

indicator that equals 1 iff the ith word is tagged y;
otherwise, zy

If no constraints are identified, then Eq. (4)
achieves maximum when all zy
i are assigned to 1,
which violates the condition that each word should
only be assigned a single entity tag. We can express
this with constraints:

After adding the constraints, the probability of the
sequence is maximized when each word is assigned
the tag with highest probability. However, some in-
valid results may still exist. For example a tag O
may be wrongly followed by a tag I-X, although a
named entity cannot start with I-X. Therefore, we
can add the following constraints:

tagged with B-X or I-X (zB-X

We first introduce the simplest hard constraints, i.e.,

Similar to monolingual constrained NER (Sec-

language as shown in Eqs. (8) and (9):

these hard bilingual constraints guarantee that when
two words are aligned, they are tagged with the same
named entity tag.
However, in practice, aligned word pairs do not
always have the same tag because of the difference
in annotation standards across different languages.
For example, in Figure 2(a), the Chinese word
is a location. However, it is aligned to the words,
development and zone, which are not named en-
tities in English. Word alignment error is another se-
rious problem that can cause violation of hard con-
straints. In Figure 2(b), the English word Agency
is wrongly aligned with the Chinese word (re-
port). Thus, these two words cannot be assigned
with the same tag.
To address these two problems, we present a prob-
abilistic model for bilingual NER which can lead to

3.2 Soft Constraints with Tag Uncertainty

The new probabilistic model for bilingual NER is:

<bodyText confidence="0.999677043478261">
where yc and ye respectively denotes Chinese and
English named entity output sequences. A is the set
of word alignment pairs.
If we assume that named entity tag assignments in
Chinese is only dependent on the observed Chinese
sentence, then we can drop the A and xe term in the
first factor of Eq. (11), and arrive at the first factor of
Eq. (12); similarly we can use the same assumption
to derive the second factor in Eq. (12) for English;
alternatively, if we assume the named entity tag as-
signments are only dependent on the cross-lingual
word associations via word alignment, then we can
drop xc and xe terms in the third factor of Eq. (11)
and arrive at the third factor of Eq. (12). These fac-
tors represent the two major sources of information
in the model: monolingual surface observation, and
cross-lingual word associations.
The first two factors of Eq. (12) can be further
decomposed into the product of probabilities of all
words in each language sentence like Eq. (2).
Assuming that the tags are independent between
different word alignment pairs, then the last factor
of Eq. (12) can be decomposed into:

where yca and yea respectively denotes Chinese and
English named entity tags in a word alignment pair
a. ycye = P(ycye)
P(yc)P(ye) is the pointwise mutual infor-
mation (PMI) score between a Chinese named en-
tity tag yc and an English named entity tag ye. If
yc = ye, then the score will be high; otherwise the
score will be low. A number of methods for calculat-
ing the scores are provided at the end of this section.
We use ILP to maximize Eq. (12). The new ob-

Monolingual constraints such as Eqs. (8) and (9)
need to be added. In addition, one and only one pos-
sible named entity tag pair exists for a word align-
ment pair. This condition can be expressed as the
following constraints:

equal to 1. Here, the ith Chinese word and the jth
English word are aligned together.
In contrast to hard bilingual constraints, inconsis-
tent named entity tags for an aligned word pair are
allowed in soft bilingual constraints, but are given
lower ycye scores.
To calculate the ycye score, an annotated bilin-
gual NER corpus is consulted. We count from all
word alignment pairs the number of times yc and ye
occur together (C(ycye)) and separately (C(yc) and
C(ye)). Afterwards, ycye is calculated with maxi-
mum likelihood estimation as follows:
</bodyText>

</equation>
<bodyText confidence="0.996205684210526">
where N is the total number of word alignment
pairs.
However, in this paper, we assume that no named
entity annotated bilingual corpus is available. Thus,
the above method is only used as Oracle. A real-
istic method for calculating the ycye score requires
the use of two initial monolingual NER models, such
as baseline CRF, to predict named entity tags for
each language on an unannotated bitext. We count
from this automatically tagged corpus the statistics
mentioned above. This method is henceforth re-
ferred to as Auto.
A simpler approach is to manually set the value
of ycye : if yc = ye then we assign a larger value
to ycye ; else we assign an ad-hoc smaller value. In
fact, if we set ycye = 1 iff yc = ye; otherwise,
ycye = 0, then the soft constraints backs off to hard
constraints. We refer to this set of soft constraints as
Soft-tag.

So far, we assumed that a word alignment set A is
known. In practice, only the word alignment proba-

set a threshold for Pa to tune the set A: a A

kind of hard word alignment. However, the follow-
ing problem exists: the smaller the , the noisier the
word alignments are; the larger the , the more pos-
sible word alignments are lost. To ameliorate this
problem, we introduce another set of soft bilingual
constraints.

We conduct experiments on the latest OntoNotes
4.0 corpus (LDC2011T03). OntoNotes is a large,
manually annotated corpus that contains various text
genres and annotations, such as part-of-speech tags,
named entity labels, syntactic parse trees, predicate-
argument structures and co-references (Hovy et al.,
2006). Aside from English, this corpus also con-
tains several Chinese and Arabic corpora. Some of
these corpora contain bilingual parallel documents.
We used the Chinese-English parallel corpus with
named entity labels as our development and test
data. This corpus includes about 400 document pairs
(chtb 0001-0325, ectb 1001-1078). We used odd-
numbered documents as development data and even-
numbered documents as test data. We used all other
portions of the named entity annotated corpus as
training data for the monolingual systems. There
were a total of 660 Chinese documents (16k sen-
tences) and 1,400 English documents (39k sen-
tences). OntoNotes annotates 18 named entity types,
such as person, location, date and money. In this
paper, we selected the four most common named

Since the bilingual corpus is only aligned at the

We used the BerkeleyAligner,5 to produce

BerkeleyAligner also gives posterior probabilities
Pa for each aligned word pair.

Chinese NER, where means string concatenation

notes the radical of the kth Chinese character of wi.7

NER (Miller et al., 2004) and dependency pars-
ing (Koo et al., 2008). To our knowledge, this work
is the first use of word clustering features for Chi-
nese NER. A C++ implementation of the Brown
word clustering algorithms (Brown et al., 1992) was
used to obtain the word clusters (Liang, 2005).8
Raw text was obtained from the fifth edition of Chi-
nese Gigaword (LDC2011T13). One million para-
graphs from Xinhua news section were randomly
selected, and the Stanford Word Segmenter with
LDC standard was applied to segment Chinese text
into words.9 About 46 million words were obtained
which were clustered into 1,000 word classes.

5 Threshold Tuning
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.997996433333334">
During development, we tuned the word alignment
probability thresholds to find the best value. Figure 3
shows the performance curves.
When the word alignment probability threshold
is set to 0.9, the hard bilingual constraints perform
well for both Chinese and English. But as the thresh-
olds value gets smaller, and more noisy word align-
ments are introduced, we see the hard bilingual con-
straints method starts to perform badly.
In Soft-tag setting, where inconsistent tag as-
signments within aligned word pairs are allowed but
penalized, different languages have different optimal
threshold values. For example, Chinese has an opti-
mal threshold of 0.7, whereas English has 0.2. Thus,
the optimal thresholds for different languages need
to be selected with care when Soft-tag is applied
in practice.
Soft-align eliminates the need for careful
tuning of word alignment thresholds, and therefore
can be more easily used in practice. Experimen-
tal results of Soft-align confirms our hypothe-
sis the performance of both Chinese and English
NER systems improves with decreasing threshold.
However, we can still improve efficiency by set-
ting a low threshold to prune away very unlikely
word alignments. We set the threshold to 0.1 for
Soft-align to increase speed, and we observed
very minimal performance lost when doing so.
We also found that automatically estimated bilin-
gual tag PMI scores (Auto) gave comparable results

6 Bilingual NER Results

The main results on Chinese and English test sets
with the optimal word alignment threshold for each
method are shown in Table 2.
The CRF-based Chinese NER with and without
word clustering features are compared here. The
word clustering features significantly (p &amp;lt; 0.01) im-
proved the performance of Chinese NER, 10 giving
us a strong Chinese NER baseline.11 The effective-
ness of word clustering for English NER has been
proved in previous work.
The performance of ILP with only monolingual
constraints is quite comparable with the CRF re-
sults, especially on English. The greater ILP perfor-
mance on English is probably due to more accurate
marginal probabilities estimated by the English CRF
model.
The ILP model with hard bilingual constraints
gives a slight performance improvement on Chi-
nese, but affects performance negatively on English.
Once we introduced tagging uncertainties into the
Soft-tag bilingual constraints, we see a very sig-

nificant (p &amp;lt; 0.01) performance boost on Chinese.
This method also improves the recall on English,
with a smaller decrease in precision. Overall, it im-
proves English F1 score by about 0.4%, which is un-
fortunately not statistically significant.
Compared with Soft-tag, the final
Soft-align method can further improve
performance on both Chinese and English. This is
likely to be because: 1) Soft-align includes
more word alignment pairs, thereby improving
recall; and 2) uses probabilities to cut wrong
word alignments, thereby improving precision. In
particular, compared with the strong CRF baseline,
the gain on Chinese side is almost 5.5% in absolute
F1 score.
Decoding/inferenc efficiency of different methods
are shown in the last column of Table 2.12 Com-
pared with Viterbi decoding in CRF, monolingual
ILP decoding is about 2.3 times slower. Bilingual
ILP decoding, with either hard or soft constraints, is
significantly slower than the monolingual methods.
The reason is that the number of monolingual ILP
constraints doubles, and there are additionally many
more bilingual constraints. The difference in speed
between the Soft-tag and Soft-align meth-
ods is attributed to the difference in number of word
alignment pairs.

The above results show the usefulness of our method
in a bilingual setting, where we are presented with
sentence aligned data, and are tagging both lan-
guages at the same time. To have a greater impact
on general monolingual NER systems, we employ
a semi-supervised learning setting. First, we tag a
large amount of unannotated bitext with our bilin-
gual constraint-based NER tagger. Then we mix the
automatically tagged results with the original mono-
lingual Chinese training data to train a new model.
Our bitext is derived from the Chinese-English
part of the Foreign Broadcast Information Service
corpus (FBIS, LDC2003E14). The best perform-
ing bilingual model Soft-align with threshold
= 0.1 was used under the same experimental set-
ting as described in Section 4

by duplicating the original training data. There
was some slight improvements, but not very signif-
icant. Finally, when we add 80k sentences, the F1

Previous work explored the use of bilingual corpora
to improve existing monolingual analyzers. Huang
et al. (2009) proposed methods to improve parsing
performance using bilingual parallel corpus. Li et
al. (2012) jointly labeled bilingual named entities
with a cyclic CRF model, where approximate in-
ference was done using loopy belief propagation.
These methods require manually annotated bilingual

\x0ccorpora, which are expensive to construct, and hard
to obtain. Kim et al. (2012) proposed a method of
labeling bilingual corpora with named entity labels
automatically based on Wikipedia. However, this
method is restricted to topics covered by Wikipedia.
Similar to our work, Burkett et al. (2010) also as-
sumed that annotated bilingual corpora are scarce.
Beyond the difference discussed in Section 1, their
re-ranking strategy may lose the correct named en-
tity results if they are not included in the top-N out-
puts. Furthermore, we consider the word alignment
probabilities in our method which can reduce the in-
fluence of word alignment errors. Finally, we test
our method on a large standard publicly available
corpus (8,249 sentences), while they used a much
smaller (200 sentences) manually annotated bilin-
gual NER corpus for results validation.
In addition to bilingual corpora, bilingual dictio-
naries are also useful resources. Huang and Vo-
gel (2002) and Chen et al. (2010) proposed ap-
proaches for extracting bilingual named entity pairs
from unannotated bitext, in which verification is
based on bilingual named entity dictionaries. How-
ever, large-scale bilingual named entity dictionaries
are difficult to obtain for most language pairs.
Yarowsky and Ngai (2001) proposed a projection
method that transforms high-quality analysis results
of one language, such as English, into other lan-
guages on the basis of word alignment. Das and
Petrov (2011) applied the above idea to part-of-
speech tagging with a more complex model. Fu et al.
(2011) projected English named entities onto Chi-
nese by carefully designed heuristic rules. Although
this type of method does not require manually an-
notated bilingual corpora or dictionaries, errors in
source language results, wrong word alignments and
inconsistencies between the languages limit applica-
tion of this method.
Constraint-based monolingual methods by using
ILP have been successfully applied to many natural
language processing tasks, such as Semantic Role
Labeling (Punyakanok et al., 2004), Dependency
Parsing (Martins et al., 2009) and Textual Entail-
ment (Berant et al., 2011). Zhuang and Zong (2010)
proposed a joint inference method for bilingual se-
mantic role labeling with ILP. However, their ap-
proach requires training an alignment model with a
manually annotated corpus.

We proposed a novel ILP based inference algorithm
with bilingual constraints for NER. This method
can jointly infer bilingual named entities without
using any annotated bilingual corpus. We in-
vestigate various bilingual constraints: hard and
soft constraints. Out empirical study on large-
scale OntoNotes Chinese-English parallel NER data
showed that Soft-align method, which allows
inconsistent named entity tags between two aligned
words and considers word alignment probabilities,
can significantly improve over the performance of
a strong Chinese NER baseline. Our work is the
first to evaluate performance on a large-scale stan-
dard dataset. Finally, we can also improve mono-
lingual Chinese NER performance significantly, by
combining the original monolingual training data
with new data obtained from bitext tagged by our
method. The final ILP-based bilingual NER tag-
ger with soft constraints is publicly available at:
github.com/carfly/bi_ilp
Future work could apply the bilingual constraint-
based method to other tasks, such as part-of-speech
tagging and relation extraction.

We propose a method that formulates the problem of exploring such signals on unannotated bilingual text as a simple Integer Linear Program, which encourages entity tags to agree via bilingual constraints. Bilingual NER experiments on the large OntoNotes 4.0 Chinese-English corpus show that the proposed method can improve strong baselines for both Chinese and English. In particular, Chinese performance improves by over 5% absolute F1 score. We can then annotate a large amount of bilingual text (80k sentence pairs) using our method, and add it as uptraining data to the original monolingual NER training corpus. The Chinese model retrained on this new combined dataset outperforms the strong baseline by over 3% F1 score.</abstract>

The performance of ILP with only monolingual constraints is quite comparable with the CRF results, especially on English. The greater ILP performance on English is probably due to more accurate marginal probabilities estimated by the English CRF model. The ILP model with hard bilingual constraints gives a slight performance improvement on Chinese, but affects performance negatively on English. Once we introduced tagging uncertainties into the Soft-tag bilingual constraints, we see a very sig10 We use paired bootstrap resampling significance test (Efron and Tibshirani, 1993). 11 To the best of our knowledge, there was no performance report of state-of-the-art NER results on the latest OntoNotes dataset. nificant (p &amp;lt; 0.01) performance boost on Chinese. This method also improves the recall on English, with a smaller decrease in precision. Overall, it improves English F1 score by about 0.4%, which is unfortunately not statistically significant. Compared with Soft-tag, the final Soft-align method can further improve performance on both Chinese and English. This is likely to be because: 1) Soft-align includes more word alignment pairs, thereby improving recall; and 2</context>

For example, in Figure 1, the word (Ben) is common in Chinese but rarely appears as a translated foreign name. However, its aligned word on the English side (Ben) provides a strong clue that this is a person name. Judicious use of this type of bilingual cues can help to recognize errors a monolingual tagger would make, allowing us to produce more accurately tagged bitext. Each side of the tagged bitext can then be used to expand the original monolingual training dataset, which may lead to higher accuracy in the monolingual taggers. Previous work such as Li et al. (2012) and Kim et al. (2012) demonstrated that bilingual corpus annotated with NER labels can be used to improve monolingual tagger performance. But a major drawback of their approaches are the need for manual annotation efforts to create such corpora. To avoid this requirement, Burkett et al. (2010) suggested a multi-view learning scheme based on re-ranking. Noisy output of a strong tagger is used as training data to learn parameters of a log-linear re-ranking model with additional bilingual features, simulated by a weak tagger. The learned parameters are then reused with the strong tagger to re-ra</context>

Our work is inspired by Roth and Yih (2005). But instead of directly solving the shortest-path problem in the ILP formulation, we re-define the conditional probability as: PMAR(y|x) = Y i P(yi|x) (2) where P(yi|x) is the marginal probability given by an underlying CRF model computed using forwardbackward inference. Since the early HMM literature, it has been well known that using the marginal distributions at each position works well, as opposed to Viterbi MAP sequence labeling (Merialdo, 1994). Our experimental results also supports this claim, as we will show in Section 6.

We propose a set of intuitive and effective bilingual constraints that encourage NER results to agree across the two languages. Experimental results on the OntoNotes 4.0 named entity annotated Chinese-English parallel corpus show that the proposed method can improve the strong Chinese NER baseline by over 5% F1 score and also give small improvements over the English baseline. Moreover, by adding the automatically tagged data to the original NER training corpus and retraining the monolingual model using an uptraining regimen (Petrov et al., 2010), we can improve the monolingual Chinese NER performance by over 3% F1 score. 2 Constraint-based Monolingual NER NER is a sequence labeling task where we assign a named entity tag to each word in an input sentence. One commonly used tagging scheme is the BIO scheme. The tag B-X (Begin) represents the first word of a named entity of type X, for example, PER (Person) or LOC (Location). The tag I-X (Inside) indicates that a word is part of an entity but not first word. The tag O (Outside) is used for all nonentity words.2 See Figure 1 for an example tagged sentence.
