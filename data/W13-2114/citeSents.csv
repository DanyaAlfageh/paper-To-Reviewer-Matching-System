 For example, CITATION claim that prepositional phrases are often not fundamental to the meaning of a sentence, so they remove them when simplifying a sentence,,
 One pre-processing step we do perform is pronominal anaphora resolution CITATION,,
 We generate the SRL parse CITATION in order to extract a set of predicate frames,,

 As seen in CITATION, who use Stanford Tregex CITATION for pattern matching, the specificity of syntactic patterns can make it difficult to specify a syntactic pattern of the desired scope,,

 Glossary features note the number 112 \x0cof glossary terms that appear in a sentence and question and a measure of the average importance of each term, which we calculated from a simple in-terms-of graph CITATION we constructed from the glossary,,
