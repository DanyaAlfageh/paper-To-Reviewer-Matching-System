While there have been well-known studies about classifying verbs based on aspectual features CITATION, thematic roles and selectional restrictions (CITATION; CITATION; CITATION), valence alternations and intuitions CITATION and conceptual structures CITATION, we found that none of the existing lexical resources such as Framenet CITATION and Verbnet CITATION are sufficient for identifying experience-revealing verbs.,,
We utilize two major resources of lexical semantics, Verbnet CITATION based on the theory of CITATION, and Framenet CITATION, which is based on CITATION.,,
CITATION demonstrated that syntactic alternations can be the basis for groupings of verbs semantically and accord reasonably well with linguistic intuitions.,,
2.5 Classification For training, we selected 80 seed verbs from Dowtys list (1979) which are representative verbs for each CITATION class.,,
One of our classifiers is based on Maximum Entropy (ME) models that implement the intuition that the best model will be the one that is consistent with the set of constraints imposed by the evidence, but otherwise is as uniform as possible CITATION.,,
The other one is based on Support Vector Machine CITATION which is the state-of-the-art algorithm for many classification tasks.,,
We used RBF kernel with the default settings CITATION because it is been known to show moderate performance using multiple feature compositions.,,
