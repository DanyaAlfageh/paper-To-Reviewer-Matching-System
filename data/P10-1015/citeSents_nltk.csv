Bakhtins term for this causal relationship was chronotope: the intrinsic interconnectedness of temporal and spatial relationships that are artistically expressed in literature, in which space becomes charged and responsive to movements of time, plot, and history (CITATION, 84).,,

They are drawn towards those unknown yet congenial faces seen in gardens, or at the theater; future friends, or rivals, or both (CITATION, 65).,,
The result is two-fold: more characters, indeed a mass of characters, and more interactions, although less actual conversation; as literary critic Terry Eagleton argues, the city is where most of our encounters consist of seeing rather than speaking, glimpsing each other as objects rather than conversing as fellow subjects (CITATION, 145).,,
For him, the difference in number of characters is not just a matter of quantity... its a qualitative, morphological one (CITATION, 68).,,
The narrative system becomes complicated, unstable: the city turns into a gigantic roulette table, where helpers and antagonists mix in unpredictable combinations (CITATION, 6,,
