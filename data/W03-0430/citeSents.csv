 Previous work has built lexicons from fixed corpora by determining linguistic patterns for the context in which relevant words appear (CITATION; CITATION),,
 Founded on the principle of constructing only those feature conjunctions that significantly increase loglikelihood, the approach builds on that of Della CITATION, but is altered to work with conditional rather than joint probabilities, and with a mean-field approximation and other additional modifications that improve efficiency specifically for a sequence model,,
 Following (Della CITATION), we efficiently assess many candidate features in parallel by assuming that the parameters on all included features remain fixed while estimating the gain, G(g), of a candidate feature, g, based on the improvement in log-likelihood it provides, G(g) = max G(g, ) = max L+g L,,

 2 Conditional Random Fields Conditional Random Fields (CRFs) CITATION are undirected graphical models used to calculate the conditional probability of values on designated output nodes given values assigned to other designated input nodes,,
 It has recently been shown that quasi-Newton methods, such as L-BFGS, are significantly more efficient than traditional iterative scaling and even conjugate gradient (CITATION; CITATION),,

 There can easily be over 100,000 atomic tests (mostly based on tests for the identity of words in the vocabulary), and ten or more shifted-conjunction patternsresulting in several million features CITATION,,
