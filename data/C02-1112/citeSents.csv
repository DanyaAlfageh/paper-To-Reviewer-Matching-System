 WordNet senses as used in Senseval 2 CITATION) is far from application needs,,
 Nevertheless, recent work (CITATIONa) shows that it is possible to exploit the precision-coverage trade-off and build a high precision WSD system that tags a limited number of target words with a predefined precision,,
 The first method is based on a decisionthreshold CITATION: the algorithm rejects decisions taken when the difference of the maximum likelihood among the competing senses is not big enough,,
 As in CITATION, we adjusted the measure to the amount of evidence,,
 For more details check (CITATIONb),,
 The second method is based on feature selection (CITATIONa),,
 Basic feature set We have taken a basic feature set widely used in the literature, divided in topical features and local features (CITATIONb),,
 Despite their simplicity, Decision Lists (Dlist for short) as defined in CITATION have been shown to be very effective for WSD (Kilgarriff & Palmer, 2000),,
 Decisions taken with negative values were discarded (CITATIONb),,
 A preliminary analysis has been performed in (CITATIONb),,

 We used TnT CITATION for PoS tagging,,
 Three parsers fulfilled all the requirements: Link Grammar CITATION, Minipar CITATION and CITATION,,
 CITATION achieve good results with syntactic relations as features,,
 The features are extracted using a statistical parser CITATION, and consist of the head and modifiers of each phrase,,

 This particular boosting algorithm is able to work efficiently in very high dimensional feature spaces, and has been applied, with significant success, to a number of NLP disambiguation tasks, including word sense disambiguation CITATION,,
