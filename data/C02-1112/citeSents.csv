CITATION achieve good results with syntactic relations as features,,
Basic feature set We have taken a basic feature set widely used in the literature, divided in topical features and local features (CITATIONb),,
The Senseval-2 workshop was held in Toulouse in July 2001 CITATION,,
As in CITATION, we adjusted the measure to the amount of evidence,,
Decisions taken with negative values were discarded (CITATIONb),,
The second method is based on feature selection (CITATIONa),,
The first method is based on a decisionthreshold CITATION: the algorithm rejects decisions taken when the difference of the maximum likelihood among the competing senses is not big enough,,
CITATION defined a basic set of features that has been widely used (with some variations) by other WSD systems,,
Three parsers fulfilled all the requirements: Link Grammar CITATION, Minipar CITATION and CITATION,,
WordNet senses as used in Senseval 2 CITATION) is far from application needs,,
A preliminary analysis has been performed in (CITATIONb),,
We used TnT CITATION for PoS tagging,,
Despite their simplicity, Decision Lists (Dlist for short) as defined in CITATION have been shown to be very effective for WSD (Kilgarriff & Palmer, 2000),,
The features are extracted using a statistical parser CITATION, and consist of the head and modifiers of each phrase,,
For more details check (CITATIONb),,
This particular boosting algorithm is able to work efficiently in very high dimensional feature spaces, and has been applied, with significant success, to a number of NLP disambiguation tasks, including word sense disambiguation CITATION,,
Nevertheless, recent work (CITATIONa) shows that it is possible to exploit the precision-coverage trade-off and build a high precision WSD system that tags a limited number of target words with a predefined precision,,
