With improvements in the state-of-the-art in machine translation, the effectiveness of purely surface-oriented measures has been questioned (see e.g., CITATION).,,
In response, metrics have been proposed that attempt to integrate more linguistic information into the matching process to distinguish linguistically licensed from unwanted variation CITATION.,,
However, there is little agreement on what types of knowledge are helpful: Some suggestions concentrate on lexical information, e.g., by the integration of word similarity information as in Meteor (Banerjee and Lavie, 2005) or MaxSim CITATION.,,
Thus, the human annotation for the WMT 2008 dataset was collected in the form of binary pairwise preferences that are considerably easier to make CITATION.,,

In this paper, we investigate an MT evaluation metric that is inspired by the similarity between this task and the textual entailment task CITATION, which This paper is based on work funded by the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency through IBM.,,
The construction of an optimal ordering from weighted pairwise preferences is an NPhard problem (via reduction of CYCLIC-ORDERING; Barzilay and Elhadad, 2002), but a greedy search yields a close approximation CITATION.,,

Information about the presence or absence of entailment between two sentences has been found to be beneficial for a range of NLP tasks such as Word Sense Disambiguation or Question Answering (CITATION; CITATION).,,

We combine different parametrization of (smoothed) BLEU CITATION, NIST CITATION, and TER CITATION, to give a total of roughly 100 features.,,

Information about the presence or absence of entailment between two sentences has been found to be beneficial for a range of NLP tasks such as Word Sense Disambiguation or Question Answering (CITATION; CITATION).,,
Due to its strict compositional nature, TE requires an accurate semantic analysis of all sentence parts, since, for example, one misanalysed negation or counterfactual embedding can invert the entailment status CITATION.,,
