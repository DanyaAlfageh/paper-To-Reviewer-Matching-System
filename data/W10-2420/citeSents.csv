Bcubed CITATION and CEAF CITATION are the two most popular metrics; they compute Precision, Recall and F1 measure between matched equivalent classes and use weighted sums of Precision, Recall and F1 to produce a global score,,
(Vilian et al., 1995; CITATION; CITATION),,
Consequently, very few corpora with gold standard CRR annotations are available (CITATION; MUC-6, 1995; Agirre, 2007),,
There are only four such CRR systems freely available, to the best of our knowledge (Bengston and Roth, 2007; CITATION; Baldridge and Torton, 2004; CITATION),,
In comparison, there are numerous Named Entity recognition (NER) systems, both general-purpose and specialized, and many of them achieve scores better than F1 = 0.95 (CITATION; Finkel et al., 136 \x0c2005),,
As mentioned earlier, we used the following four publicly available CRR systems: UIUCs LBJ system (L), BART from JHU Summer Workshop (B), LingPipe from Alias-i (LP), and OpenNLP (OP) (Bengston and Roth, 2007; CITATION; Baldridge and Torton, 2004; CITATION),,
In fact, we find that the Pearsons correlation coefficient (CITATION; CITATION) is 0.73,,
We use SYNERGY CITATION, an ensemble NER system that combines the UIUC NER (Ritanov and Roth, 2009) and Stanford NER CITATION systems, to produce GNM and ONM from G and O by selecting named mentions,,
We used CONE B3 and CONE CEAF to evaluate and compare the NE-CRR performance of various CRR systems on a subset of the Enron e-mail corpus CITATION that was cleaned and stripped of spam messages,,
CEAF CITATION produces the optimal matching between output classes and true classes first, with the constraint that one true class, Gi, can be mapped to at most one output class, say Of(i) and vice versa,,
This can be solved by the KM algorithm (CITATION; CITATION) for maximum matching in a bipartite graph,,
The BLEU score CITATION proposed for evaluating machine translation results is the best known example of this,,
It inspired the ROUGE metric CITATION and other methods CITATION to perform automatic evaluation of text summarization,,
Another example is the alignment entropy CITATION for evaluating transliteration alignment,,

Consequently, very few corpora with gold standard CRR annotations are available (CITATION; MUC-,,
We adopt the same terminology as in CITATION: a mention refers to each individual phrase and an entity refers to the equivalence class or co-reference chain with several mentions,,

We contrast our work with CITATION, who show that the co-reference resolution problem can be separated into different parts according to the type of the mention,,
