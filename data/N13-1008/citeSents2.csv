This is the approach taken by OpenIE CITATION,,
CITATION,,
Our first baseline is MI09, a distantly supervised classifier based on the work of CITATION,,
Here one aligns existing database records with the sentences in which these records have been renderedeffectively labeling the textand from this labeling we can train a machine learning system as before (CITATION; CITATION; CITATION; CITATION),,
Distant Supervision In Distant Supervision (DS) a set of facts from pre-existing structured sources is aligned with surface patterns mentioned in text (CITATION; CITATION; CITATION; CITATION; CITATION), and this alignment is then used to train a relation extractor,,
We hence also compare against YA11, a version of MI09 that uses preprocessed cluster features according to CITATION,,
The third baseline is SU12, the state-of-theart Multi-Instance Multi-Label system by CITATION,,
