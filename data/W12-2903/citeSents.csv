The closest such corpus is Switchboard CITATION, which contains 2,400 two-sided conversations with about 1.4 million words,,

As a first look at the feasibility of this approach, we use the Midge generator CITATION, rebuilding its models from the soap dialogues,,

The method of using features of a turn to predict features of the next turn is related to the work reported in CITATION, though their goal was to analyze dialog coherence rather than to predict the next utterance,,
Recent work reported in CITATION suggests one way in which the results of a language modeling system and those of a human coconstructor may be integrated into a single system, and such an approach could easily be applied here,,
In essence, ALICE is a much more sophisticated version of the 1960s Eliza program CITATION,,
In order to use the chatbot for this task, we use an AIML interpreter CITATION on the most recent set of ALICE knowledge.1 ALICE was given the utterances for each conversation in our development testing set, which allows the system to store some of the dialogue context under its THAT and TOPIC 1 http://code.google.com/p/aiml-en-us-foundation-alice/, retrieved February 2012,,
