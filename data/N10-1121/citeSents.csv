As far as the sequence and tree kernels are concerned, we used the parameter settings from CITATION, i.e,,
In order to effectively use convolution kernels, it is often necessary to choose appropriate substructures of a sentence rather than represent the sentence as a whole structure (CITATION; CITATION; CITATION),,
Predicate-argument structures (PAS) are represented by PropBank trees CITATION,,
Semantic roles were obtained by using the parser by CITATION,,
The features presented in CITATION and CITATION resemble very much CITATION,,
In this work, we evaluate two tree kernels: Subset Tree Kernel (STK) CITATION and Partial Tree Kernel (PTKbasic) CITATION,,
Previous research on that task has shown that convolution kernels, such as sequence and tree kernels, are quite effective when compared to manual feature engineering (CITATION; CITATION; CITATION),,
 use the kernel by CITATION which has the advantage that it also considers subsequences of the original sequence with some elements missing,,
Previous work (CITATION; CITATION; CITATION) uses similar approximations,,
CITATION and CITATION explore the usefulness of semantic,,
In this work, we evaluate two tree kernels: Subset Tree Kernel (STK) CITATION and Partial Tree Kernel ,,
Thus, we hope to select the predicate which syntactically headword/governing category of CAND is CAND capitalized/a person? is CAND subj|dobj|iobj|pobj of OPINION/COMM? is CAND preceded by according to? CITATION does CAND contain possessive and is followed by OPINION/COMM? CITATION is CAND preceded by by which is attached to OPINION/COMM? CITATION predicate-argument pairs in which CAND occurs lemma/part-of-speech tag/subcategorization frame/voice of nearest predicate is nearest predicate OPINION/COMM? does CAND precede/follow nearest predicate? words between nearest predicate and CAND (bag of words) part-of-speech sequence between nearest predicate and CAND constituency path/grammatical relation path from predicate to CAND Table 4: Manually designed feature set,,
Namedentity information was obtained by the Stanford tagger CITATION,,
Complex convolution kernels have been successfully applied to various NLP tasks, such as relation extraction (CITATION; CITATION; CITATION), question answering (CITATION; CITATION), and semantic role labeling CITATION,,

Due to data sparseness, CITATION expand FrameNet ,,
tasks (CITATION; CITATION),,
CITATION is an extension of CITATION in that opinion holder extraction is learnt jointly with opinion detection,,
Opinion expressions were identified using the Subjectivity Lexicon from the MPQA project CITATION,,
The documents were parsed using the Stanford Parser CITATION,,
All sources used for this type of generalization are known to be predictive for opinion holder classification (CITATION; CITATION; CITATION; CITATION; CITATION),,

the smallest subtree containing the two candidate entities of a relation, is more effective CITATION,,
Due to data sparseness, CITATION expand FrameNet data by using an unsupervised clustering algorithm,,
We use the kernel by CITATION which has the advantage that it also considers subsequences of the original sequence with some elements missing,,

2 Related Work CITATION examine opinion holder extraction using CRFs with various manually defined linguistic features and patterns automatically learnt by the AutoSlog system CITATION,,
CITATION also consider communication words to be predictive cues for opinion holders,,
Communication words were obtained by using the Appraisal Lexicon CITATION,,
CITATION and CITATION explore the usefulness of semantic roles provided by FrameNet CITATION for both opinion holder and opinion target extraction,,

However sources of private states and subjective speech events CITATION are a fairly good approximation of the task,,
