Automatic text summarization approaches have offered reasonably well-performing approximations for identifiying important sentences (CITATION; CITATION; CITATION; CITATION; Daume III and Marcu, 2006) but, not surprisingly, text (re)generation has been a major challange despite some work on sub-sentential modification (CITATION; CITATION; CITATION),,
An additional drawback of extractive approaches is that estimates for the importance of larger text units such as sentences depend on the length of the sentence CITATION,,
In our implementation, a context free grammar probabilistic parser CITATION was used to parse the input,,
2 NP-rewrite enhanced frequency summarizer Frequency and frequency-related measures of importance have been traditionally used in text summarization as indicators of importance (CITATION; CITATION; CITATION),,
Notably, a greedy frequency-driven approach leads to very good results in content selection CITATION,,
