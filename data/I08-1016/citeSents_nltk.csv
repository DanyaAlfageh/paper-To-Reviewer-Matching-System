Notably, a greedy frequency-driven approach leads to very good results in content selection CITATION,,
In our implementation, a context free grammar probabilistic parser CITATION was used to parse the input,,
was the only real non-extractive summarizer participant at DUC 2004 CITATION; the extractive frequency summarizer, and the two versions of the rewrite algorithm (Sum and Avr),,
Automatic text summarization approaches have offered reasonably well-performing approximations for identifiying important sentences (CITATION; CITATION; CITATION; CITATION; Daume III and Marcu, 2006) but, not surprisingly, text (re)generation has been a major challange despite some work on sub-sentential modification (CITATION; CITATION; CITATION),,
An additional drawback of extractive approaches is that estimates for the importance of larger text units such as sentences depend on the length of the sentence CITATION,,
Being able to change the original wording can thus allow companies to include longer than one sentence summaries, which would increase user satisfaction CITATION,,
2 NP-rewrite enhanced frequency summarizer Frequency and frequency-related measures of importance have been traditionally used in text summarization as indicators of importance (CITATION; CITATION; CITATION),,
xt summarization approaches have offered reasonably well-performing approximations for identifiying important sentences (CITATION; CITATION; CITATION; CITATION; Daume III and Marcu, 2006) but, not surprisingly, text (re)generation has been a major challange despite some work on sub-sentential modification (CITATION; CITATION; CITATION),,
