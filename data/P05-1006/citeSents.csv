 We used the Mallet toolkit CITATION for learning maximum entropy models with Gaussian priors for all our experiments,,
 In order to extract the linguistic features necessary for the models, all sentences containing the target word were automatically part-of-speech-tagged using a maximum entropy tagger CITATION and parsed using the Collins parser CITATION,,
 In addition, an automatic named entity tagger CITATION was run on the sentences to map proper nouns to a small set of semantic classes,,

 4 Related Work Our approach of using rich linguistic features combined in a single maximum entropy framework contrasts with that of CITATION,,
 CITATION explored the relative contribution of different knowledge sources and learning algorithms to WSD; they used Support Ve,,
 CITATION described an algorithm using WordNet to simultaneously determine verb senses and attachments of prepositional phrases, and iden48 \x0ctify thematic roles and adjuncts; our work is different in that it is trained on manually annotated corpora to show the relevance of semantic roles for verb sense disambiguation,,
 Early work on WSD CITATION was successful for easily distinguishable homonyms like bank, which have multiple unrelated meanings,,
 While homonyms are fairly tractable, highly polysemous verbs, which have related but subtly distinct senses, pose the greatest challenge for WSD systems CITATION,,
 Verbs are syntactically complex, and their syntax is thought to be determined by their underlying semantics (CITATION; CITATION),,
 The system performs at the best published accuracy on the English verbs of the Senseval-2 CITATION exercise on evaluating automatic WSD systems,,
 The WSJ corpus has also been manually annotated for predicate arguments as part of PropBank CITATION, and the intersection of PropBank and Senseval-2 forms a corpus containing gold-standard annotations of WordNet senses and PropBank semantic role labels,,
1% accuracy achieved by CITATION, which has been the best published result on this corpus,,
 approach of using rich linguistic features combined in a single maximum entropy framework contrasts with that of CITATION,,
 CITATION explored the relative contribution of different knowledge sources and learning algorithms to WSD; they used Support Vector Machines (SVM) and included local collocations and syntactic relations, and also found that adding syntactic features improved accuracy,,

3 Evaluation We tested the system on the 1806 test instances of the 29 verbs from the English lexical sample task for Senseval-2 CITATION,,
 In the case of role labels, only the 45 \x0cgold-standard labels found in PropBank were used, because the best automatic semantic role labelers only perform at about 84% precision and 75% recall CITATION,,
