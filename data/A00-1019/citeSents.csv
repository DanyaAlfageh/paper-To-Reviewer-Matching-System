 Techniques for weakening the independence assumptions made by the IBM models 1 and 2 have been proposed in recent work (CITATION; CITATION; Och and Weber, 98; Wang and Waibel, 98; Wu and Wong, 98),,
 Furthermore, the underlying decoding strategies are too time consuming for our application We therefore use a translation model based on the simple linear interpolation given in equation 2 which combines predictions of two translation models -- Ms and M~ -- both based on IBM-like model 2CITATION,,
1 Our approach to modeling this distribution is based to a large extent on that of the IBM group CITATION, but it differs in one significant aspect: whereas the IBM model involves a &quot;noisy channel&quot; decomposition, we use a linear combination of separate predictions from a language model p(tlt~) and a translation model p(tls),,

2 Mapping Mapping the identified units (tokens or sequences) to their equivalents in the other language was achieved by training a new translation model (IBM 2) using the EM algorithm as described in CITATION,,
3 Filtering One way to increase the precision of the mapping process is to impose some linguistic constraints on the sequences such as simple noun-phrase contraints (Ganssier, 1995; CITATION; hua Chen and Chen, 94; CITATION; CITATION),,
 It is also possible to focus on non-compositional compounds, a key point in bilingual applications (CITATION; CITATION; Lin, 99),,
 Another interesting approach is to restrict sequences to those that do not cross constituent boundary patterns (CITATION; Furuse and Iida, 96),,
