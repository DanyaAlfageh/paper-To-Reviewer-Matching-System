The LBJ Tagger is based on a regularized average perceptron CITATION,,
IdentiFinder is a state-of-the-art commercial NER tagger that uses Hidden Markov Models (HMMs) CITATION,,
Recent research has focused on non-English languages such as Spanish, Dutch, and German (Meulder et al., 2002; CITATION; CITATION), and on improving the performance of unsupervised learning methods (CITATION; CITATION),,
6 One Named-Entity Tag per Discourse Previous papers have noted that it would be unusual for multiple occurrences of a token in a document to be classified as a different type of entity (CITATION; CITATION),,
The observation is similar to a hypothesis proposed by Gale, Church, and Yarowsky with respect to word-sense disambiguation and discourse CITATION,,
This hypothesis is incorrect for word senses that we find in a dictionary CITATION but is likely to be correct for the subset of the senses that are homonymous (unrelated in meaning),,

Although Named Entity Recognition is reported in the literature to have an accuracy rate of 85-95% (Finkel et al., 2005; CITATION), it was clear by inspection that both the Stanford and the LBJ tagger made a number of mistakes,,
