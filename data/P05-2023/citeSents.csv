 The Web has already been used successfully for a series of NLP tasks such as MT CITATION, word sense disambiguation CITATION, synonym recognition CITATION, anaphora resolution CITATION and determining frequencies for unseen bi-grams CITATION,,
 Lxtransduce is an updated version of fsgmatch, the core program of LT TTT CITATION,,
 The tokenised text is then POS-tagged using TnT trained on the German newspaper corpus Negra CITATION,,
 CELEX lookup was only performed for tokens which TnT tagged as nouns (NN), foreign material (FM) or named entities (NE) since anglicisms representing other parts of speech are relatively infrequent in German CITATION,,
 We created a manually annotated gold standard using an annotation tool based on NITE XML CITATION,,
 Table 3 also shows the performance of TextCat, an n-gram-based text categorisation algorithm of CITATION,,

 We experimented with a conditional Markov model tagger that performed well on language-independent NER CITATION and the identification of gene and protein names CITATION,,
 In the first experiment (ID1), we use the taggers standard feature set including words, character sub-strings, word shapes, POS-tags, abbreviations and NE tags CITATION,,
