Statistical techniques were also successfully used by CITATION to identify paraphrases of adjective-noun phrases,,
CITATION) have observed that translations are never identical, and each translator creates his own interpretations of the text,,
From a linguistic point of view, questions concern the operative definition of paraphrases: what types of lexical relations and syntactic mechanisms can produce paraphrases? Many linguists (CITATION; de Beaugrande and Dressler, 1981) agree that paraphrases retain approximate conceptual equivalence, and are not limited only to synonymy relations,,
The first attempt to derive paraphrasing rules from corpora was undertaken by CITATION, who investigated morphological and syntactic variants of technical terms,,
Manual collection of paraphrases is usually used in generation (CITATION; CITATION),,
Most current applications use manually collected paraphrases tailored to a specific application, or utilize existing lexical resources such as WordNet CITATION to identify paraphrases,,
For example, while dog and cat are recognized as the most similar concepts by the method described in CITATION, it is hard to imagine a context in which these words would be interchangeable,,
This extension will require using a more selective alignment technique (similar to that of CITATION),,
The same question arises with automatically constructed thesauri (CITATION; CITATION),,
In fact, a similar representation was used by CITATION to describe term variations,,
Alignment is performed using dynamic programming CITATION with a weight function based on the number of common words in a sentence pair,,
In some applications, only synonyms are considered as paraphrases CITATION; in others, looser definitions are used CITATION,,
This method of co-training has been previously applied to a variety of natural language tasks, such as word sense disambiguation CITATION, lexicon construction for information extraction CITATION, and named entity classification CITATION,,
 paraphrases tailored to a specific application, or utilize existing lexical resources such as WordNet CITATION to identify paraphrases,,
Our model is based on the DLCoTrain algorithm proposed by CITATION, which applies a co-training procedure to decision list classifiers for two independent sets of features,,
From a linguistic point of view, questions concern the operative definition of paraphrases: what types of lexical relations and syntactic mechanisms can produce paraphrases? Many linguists (CITATION; de Beaugrande and Dressler, 1981) agree that paraphrases retain approximate conceptual equivalence, and are ,,
The agreement was measured using the Kappa coefficient CITATION,,
This characteristic of our corpus is similar to problems with noisy and comparable corpora (Veronis, 2000), and it prevents us from using methods developed in the MT community based on clean parallel corpora, such as CITATION,,
We then use a part-of-speech tagger and chunker CITATION to identify noun and verb phrases in the sentences,,
For example, while dog and cat are recognized as the most similar concepts by the method described in CITATION, it is hard to imagine a context in which these words would be int,,
The first of these was a machine translation technique for deriving bilingual lexicons CITATION including detection of non-compositional compounds 4,,
The judges agreement on the paraphrasing judgment without context was 7 \x05 0\'8:9\'; which is substantial agreement CITATION,,
Examples of such contexts are verb-object relations and noun-modifier relations, which were traditionally used in word similarity tasks from non-parallel corpora (CITATION; CITATION),,
But the extent of interchangeability between phrases which form paraphrases is an open question CITATION,,
The main dilemma in designing the evaluation is whether to include the context: should the human judge see only a paraphrase pair or should a pair of sentences containing these paraphrases also be given? In a similar MT task evaluation of word-to-word translation context is usually included CITATION,,
Following CITATION, filtering is based on the strength of the context and its frequency,,
ilar MT task evaluation of word-to-word translation context is usually included CITATION,,
