The first step is to use a part-of-speech tagger to identify phrases in the input text that contain adjectives or adverbs CITATION,,
Another area for future work is to empirically compare PMI-IR and the algorithm of CITATION,,
On the other hand, it would be interesting to evaluate PMI-IR on the collection of 1,336 hand-labeled adjectives that were used in the experiments of CITATION,,
Other potential applications include recognizing flames (abusive newsgroup messages) CITATION and developing new kinds of search tools CITATION,,
CITATION use a four-step supervised learning algorithm to infer the semantic orientation of adjectives from constrai,,
The second step is to estimate the semantic orientation of each extracted phrase CITATION,,
CITATION have also developed an algorithm for predicting semantic orientation,,
CITATION use a four-step supervised learning algorithm to infer the semantic orientation of adjectives from constraints on conjunctions: 1,,
As an example, they present the following three sentences CITATION: 1,,
