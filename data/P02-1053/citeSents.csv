 Other potential applications include recognizing flames (abusive newsgroup messages) CITATION and developing new kinds of search tools CITATION,,
 The first step is to use a part-of-speech tagger to identify phrases in the input text that contain adjectives or adverbs CITATION,,
 The second step is to estimate the semantic orientation of each extracted phrase CITATION,,

 This algorithm uses mutual information as a measure of the strength of semantic association between two words CITATION,,
 PMI-IR has been empirically evaluated using 80 synonym test questions from the Test of English as a Foreign Language (TOEFL), obtaining a score of 74% CITATION,,

 The Pointwise Mutual Information (PMI) between two words, word1 and word2, is defined as follows CITATION: p(word1 & word2) PMI,,
 I plan to experiment with ordinal classification of reviews in the five star rating system, using the algorithm of CITATION,,
 CITATION have also developed an algorithm for predicting semantic orientation,,
 As an example, they present the following three sentences CITATION: 1,,
 CITATION use a four-step supervised learning algorithm to infer the semantic orientation of adjectives from constraints on conjunctions: 1,,
 Another area for future work is to empirically compare PMI-IR and the algorithm of CITATION,,
 On the other hand, it would be interesting to evaluate PMI-IR on the collection of 1,336 hand-labeled adjectives that were used in the experiments of CITATION,,
