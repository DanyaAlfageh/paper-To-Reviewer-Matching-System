This is essentially what syntax-augmented MT (SAMT) does, in the stringto-tree setting CITATION,,
In addition, SAMT drops the requirement that the Xi are sisters, and uses categories X / Y (an X missing a Y on the right) and Y \\ X (an X missing a Y on the left) in the style of categorial grammar CITATION,,
These were smoothed using modified Kneser-Ney CITATION and stored using randomized data structures similar to those of CITATION,,
The base feature set for all systems was similar to the expanded set recently used for Hiero CITATION, but with bigram features (source and target word) instead of trigram features (source and target word and neighboring source word),,
The systems were trained using MIRA (CITATION; CITATION) on a tuning set of about 3000 sentences of newswire from NIST MT evaluation data and GALE deve,,

The simplest of these CITATION make no use of information from syntactic theories or syntactic annotations, whereas others have successfully incorporated syntactic information on the target side (CITATION; CITATION) or the source side (CITATION; CITATION),,
But the natural generalization to this setting has been found to underperform phrasebased models (CITATION; Ambati and Lavie, 2008), and researchers have begun to explore solutions (CITATION; CITATION),,
wing on previous successful attempts to relax syntactic constraints during grammar extraction in various ways (CITATION; CITATION; CITATION), we compare several methods for extracting a synchronous grammar from tree-to-tree data,,
We therefore propose to move these constraints from the formalism into the model, implemented as features in the hierarchical phrasebased model Hiero CITATION,,

For string-to-string extraction, we used the same constraints as in previous work CITATION, with differences shown in Table 2,,
All systems used the glue rule CITATION, which allows the decoder, working bottom-up, to stop building hierarchical structure and instead concatenate partial translations without any reordering,,
We word-aligned the Chinese-English parallel text using GIZA++ followed by link deletion CITATION, and the Arabic-English parallel text using a combination of GIZA++ and LEAF CITATION,,
We parsed the source sides of both parallel texts using the Berkeley parser CITATION, trained on the Chinese Treebank 6 and Arabic Treebank parts 13, and the English sides using a reimplementation of the Collins parser CITATION,,

CITATION, in the string-to-tree setting, attempt to soften the data-fragmentation effect of the matching constraint: instead of trying to find the single derivation with the highest probability, they sum over derivations that differ only in their nonterminal labels and try to find the single derivation-class with the highest probability,,
