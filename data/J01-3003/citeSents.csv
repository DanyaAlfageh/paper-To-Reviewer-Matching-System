 Introduction Automatic acquisition of lexical knowledge is critical to a wide range of natural language processing (NLP) tasks CITATION,,
 In facing the task of automatic acquisition of knowledge about verbs, two basic questions must be addressed: What information about verbs and their relational properties needs to be learned? What information can in practice be learned through automatic means? In answering these questions, some approaches to lexical acquisition have focused on learning syntactic information about verbs, by automatically extracting subcategorization frames from a corpus or machine-readable dictionary (CITATION; CITATION; CITATION; CITATION; CITATION; CITATION),,

 In a causative alternation, the semantic argument of the subject of the intransitive surfaces as the object of the transitive (CITATION; CITATION; CITATION; Levin and Rappaport Hovav 1995),,
 For unergatives, this argument is an Agent and thus the alternation yields an object in the transitive form that receives an Agent thematic role CITATION,,
" This is the ""causative/inchoative alternation"" (CITATION,,"

 We think that many cases of ambiguous classification of the lexical entry for a verb can be addressed with the notion of intersective sets introduced by CITATION,,

 To approximate animacy with a feature that can be extracted automatically, and without reference to a resource external to the corpus, we take advantage of the well-attested animacy hierarchy, according to which pronouns are the most animate (CITATION; CITATION),,

 Many recent results, however, seem to converge in supporting the view that the relation between lexical syntax and semantics can be usefully exploited (CITATION; CITATION; Dorr, Garman, and Weinberg 1995; Dorr and Jones 1996; CITATION; Schulte im Walde 2000; CITATION; CITATION),,
 In light of these recent successes, the conclusions in CITATION are clearly too pessimistic,,
 For example, CITATION summarizes a number of automatic classification experiments based on encoding Levin\'s alternations directly, as symbolic properties of a verb (Dorr, Garman, and Weinberg 1995; Dorr and Jones 1996),,
 Thus, our approach would also be compatible with a feature-based deftnition of participant roles, as long as the features capture such general distinctions as, for example, the doer of an action and the entity acted upon CITATION,,
 The Prague school\'s notion of linguistic markedness (CITATION; CITATION) enables us to establish a scale of markedness of these thematic assignments and make a principled prediction about their frequency of occurrence,,
 Typical tests to determine the unmarked element of a pair or scale are simplicity--the unmarked element is simpler, distribution--the unmarked member is more widely attested across languages, and frequency--the un378 \x0cMerlo and Stevenson Statistical Verb Classification marked member is more frequent (CITATION; CITATION),,
 However, according to CITATION, each class exhibits a different type of diathesis alternation, which is determined by the particular semantic relations of the arguments to the verb,,
 We assume here that a thematic role is a label taken from a fixed inventory of grammaticalized semantic relations; for example, an Agent is the doer of an action, and a Theme is the entity undergoing an event CITATION,,
 In a causative alternation, the semantic argument of the subject of the intransitive surfaces as the object of the transitive (CITATION; CITATION; CITATION; Levin and Rappaport Hovav 1995),,

 Using combinations of seven statistical indicators (some morphological and some reflecting syntactic cooccurrences), it is possible to learn the distinction between events and states for 739 verb tokens with an improvement of 10% over the baseline (error rate reduction of 74%), and to learn the distinction between culminated and non-culminated events for 308 verb tokens with an improvement of 11% (error rate reduction of 29%) CITATION,,
 In work on lexical semantic verb classification, CITATION further support the thesis of a predictive correlation between syntax and semantics in a statistical framework, showing that the frequency distributions of subcategorization frames within and across classes can disambiguate the usages of a verb with more than one known lexical semantic class,,
 We improve on the approach of CITATION by learning argument structure properties, which, unlike grammatical functions, are not marked morphologically, and by not relying on external sources of knowledge,,

 On the other hand, each of the three classes is comprised of multiple Levin classes, because the latter reflect more detailed semantic distinctions among the verbs CITATION; thus, classification based on Levin\'s labeling would miss generalizations across the three broader classes,,
