They conclude that the thesis put forth by CITATION) is only partially supported,,
This evaluation is also supported by a 3-way agreement measure CITATION,,
400 \x0cMerlo and Stevenson Statistical Verb Classification Schulte im Walde (2000) applies two clustering methods to two types of frequency data for 153 verbs from 30 CITATION classes,,
The Prague school\'s notion of linguistic markedness (CITATION; CITATION) enables us to establish a scale of markedness of these thematic assignments and make a principled prediction about their frequency of occurrence,,
Other work has attempted to learn deeper semantic properties such as selectional restrictions (CITATION; CITATION), verbal aspect (CITATION; CITATION), or lexical-semantic verb classes such as those proposed by CITATION (CITATION; CITATION; CITATION; Schulte im Walde 2000),,
CITATION, working with a much coarsergrained classification of verbs, present a technique for predicate-argument extraction from multi-lingual texts,,
We address the problem of classification because it provides a means for lexical organization which can effectively capture generalizations over verbs CITATION,,
In light of these recent successes, the conclusions in CITATION are clearly too pessimistic,,
This connection relies heavily on the hypothesis that lexical semantics and lexical syntax are correlated, following CITATION; 1993),,
For further details and support of this analysis, please see the discussion in CITATIONb) and CITATIONb),,
CITATION cites the convention from the domain of content analysis indicating that .67 K K < .8 indicates marginal agreement, while K &gt; .8 is an indication of good agreement,,
We think that many cases of ambiguous classification of the lexical entry for a verb can be addressed with the notion of intersective sets introduced by CITATION,,
"This is the ""causative/inchoative alternation"" CITATION,,"
On the other hand, our approach is similar to the approaches of Siegel, and CITATION, in attempting to learn semantic notions from distributions of 12 A baselineof 5%is reported, basedon a closest-neighborpairing of verbs, but it is not straightforward to compare,,
To approximate animacy with a feature that can be extracted automatically, and without reference to a resource external to the corpus, we take advantage of the well-attested animacy hierarchy, according to which pronouns are the most animate (CITATION; CITATION),,
For unergatives, this argument is an Agent and thus the alternation yields an object in the transitive form that receives an Agent thematic role CITATION,,
Because knowledge of argument structure captures fundamental participant/event relations, it is crucial in parsing and generation (e.g., Srinivas and Joshi [1999]; Stede [1998]), in machine translation CITATION, and in information retrieval CITATION and extraction CITATION,,
Because we achieved approximately the same level of performance in all cases, we narrowed our further experimentation to the publicly available version of the C5.0 machine learning system (http://www.rulequest.com), a newer version of C4.5 CITATION, due to its ease of use and wide availability,,
On the other hand, each of the three classes is comprised of multiple Levin classes, because the latter reflect more detailed semantic distinctions among the verbs CITATION; thus, classification based on Levin\'s labeling would miss generalizations across the three broader classes,,
"This is an important concept, which proposes that ""regular"" ambiguity in classification--i.e., sets of verbs that have the same multi-way classifications according to CITATION--can be captured with a finer-grained notion of lexical semantic classes,,"
While Dorr\'s work requires finding exact exemplars of the alternation, CITATION present a method that, like ours, uses surface indicators to approximate underlying properties,,
For example, CITATION show that, contrary to the naive assumption, speakers\' preferences in syntactic disambiguation are not simply directly related to frequency (i.e., a speaker\'s preference for one construction over another is not simply modelled by the frequency of the construction, or of the words in the construction),,
Our results were replicated in English without the need for a fully parsed corpus (Anoop Sarkar, p.c., citing a project report by Wootiporn Tripasai).Our method was applied to 23 million words of the WSJ that were automatically tagged with Ratnaparkhi\'s maximum entropy tagger CITATIONand chunked with the partial parser CASS CITATION.The results are very similar to ours (best accuracy 66.6%), suggesting that a more accurate tagger than the one used on our corpus might in fact be sufficient to overcome the fact that no full parse is available,,
CITATION proposes a method to identify diathesis alternations,,
However, this position has been challenged by Basili, Pazienza, and Velardi (1996) and CITATION, among others,,
Ritter 1991; CITATION; CITATION; Levin and Rappaport Hovav 1995),,
In facing the task of automatic acquisition of knowledge about verbs, two basic questions must be addressed: What information about verbs and their relational properties needs to be learned? What information can in practice be learned through automatic means? In answering these questions, some approaches to lexical acquisition have focused on learning syntactic information about verbs, by automatically extracting subcategorization frames from a corpus or machine-readable dictionary (CITATION; CITATION; CITATION; CITATION; CITATION; CITATION),,
"This class is the most heterogeneous in our verb list, consisting of verbs from several subclasses of the ""unexpressed object alternation"" class in CITATION,,"
Many recent results, however, seem to converge in supporting the view that the relation between lexical syntax and semantics can be usefully exploited (CITATION; CITATION; Dorr, Garman, and Weinberg 1995; Dorr and Jones 1996; CITATION; Schulte im Walde 2000; CITATION; CITATION),,
We assume here that a thematic role is a label taken from a fixed inventory of grammaticalized semantic relations; for example, an Agent is the doer of an action, and a Theme is the entity undergoing an event CITATION,,
On the other hand, when learning of thematic role assignment has been the explicit goal, the text has been semantically annotated CITATION, or external semantic resources have been consulted (CITATION; CITATION),,
Furthermore, it appears that the classes capture typological distinctions that are useful for machine translation (for example, causative unergatives are ungrammatical in many languages), as well as processing distinctions that are useful for generating naturally occurring language (for example, reduced relatives with unergative verbs are awkward, but they are acceptable, and in fact often preferred to full relatives for unaccusative and object-drop verbs) (CITATIONb; CITATION),,
roposed by CITATION (CITATION; CITATION; CITATION; Schulte im Walde 2000),,
CITATION shows that a method very similar to ours can be used for identifying alternations,,
Typical tests to determine the unmarked element of a pair or scale are simplicity--the unmarked element is simpler, distribution--the unmarked member is more widely attested across languages, and frequency--the un378 \x0cMerlo and Stevenson Statistical Verb Classification marked member is more frequent (CITATION; CITATION),,
This corpus of 29 million words was provided to us by Michael Collins, and was automatically parsed with the parser described in CITATION,,
For example, CITATION summarizes a number of automatic classification experiments based on encoding Levin\'s alternations directly, as symbolic properties of a verb (Dorr, Garman, and Weinberg 1995; Dorr and Jones 1996),,
On the other hand, our approach is similar to the approaches of Siegel, and CITATION, in attempting to learn semantic notions from distributions of 12 A baselineof 5%is reported, basedon a closest-neighborpairing of verbs, but it is not straightforward to comparethis taskto the proposed cl,,
"This is dubbed ""the unexpressed object alternation"" CITATION, and has several subtypes that we do not distinguish here,,"
This double event structure can be considered as more complex than the single event that is found in a transitive object-drop verb (such as play) (CITATIONb),,
Furthermore, in contrast to CITATION and CITATION our method applies successfully to previously unseen words--i.e., test cases that were not represented in the training set,,
We improve on the approach of CITATION by learning argument structure properties, which, unlike grammatical functions, are not marked morphologically, and by not relying on external sources of knowledge,,
3.1 Materials and Method We chose a set of 20 verbs from each class based primarily on the classification in CITATION,,
Thus, our approach would also be compatible with a feature-based deftnition of participant roles, as long as the features capture such general distinctions as, for example, the doer of an action and the entity acted upon CITATION,,
However, according to CITATION, each class exhibits a different type of diathesis alternation, which is determined by the particular semantic relations of the arguments to the verb,,
"The type of causative alternation that unergatives participate in is the ""induced action alternation"" according to CITATION,,"
Others have tackled the problem of lexical semantic classification, but using only subcategorization frequencies as input data (CITATION; Schulte im Walde 2000),,
In work on lexical semantic verb classification, CITATION further support the thesis of a predictive correlation between syntax and semantics in a statistical framework, showing that the frequency distributions of subcategorization frames within and across classes can disambiguate the usages of a verb with more than one known lexical semantic class,,
"For example, in an attempt to assess the actual completeness and usefulness of the Longman Dictionary of Contemporary English (LDOCE) entries, CITATION found that people assigned a 398 \x0cMerlo and Stevenson Statistical Verb Classification ""change of possession"" meaning both to verbs that had dative-related subcategorization frames (as indicated in the LDOCE) and to verbs that did not,,"
4.1 Experimental Methodology In pilot experiments on a subset of the features, we investigated a number of supervised machine learning methods that produce automatic classifiers (decision tree induction, rule learning, and two types of neural networks), as well as hierarchical clustering; see CITATION for more detail,,
Using combinations of seven statistical indicators (some morphological and some reflecting syntactic cooccurrences), it is possible to learn the distinction between events and states for 739 verb tokens with an improvement of 10% over the baseline (error rate reduction of 74%), and to learn the distinction between culminated and non-culminated events for 308 verb tokens with an improvement of 11% (error rate reduction of 29%) CITATION,,
We, like others in a computational framework, have extended this idea by showing that statistics over the alternants of a verb effectively capture information about its class (CITATION; CITATION; CITATION),,
The verbs in group I had been used in an earlier study in which it was important to minimize noisy data (CITATIONa), so they generally underwent greater manual intervention in the counts,,
"This is the ""causative/inchoative alternation"" (CITATION,,"
Introduction Automatic acquisition of lexical knowledge is critical to a wide range of natural language processing (NLP) tasks CITATION,,
CITATION also use features that are intended to tap into both subcategorization and thematic role distinctions--frequencies of the transitive use and animate subject use,,
In a causative alternation, the semantic argument of the subject of the intransitive surfaces as the object of the transitive (CITATION; CITATION; CITATION; Levin and Rappaport Hovav 1995),,
