The performance of the best systems in the original shared task is shown for reference ((Bjorne et al., 2009) in Task 1 and CITATION in Task 2),,
The BioNLP 2009 Shared Task, a recent bio-molecular event extraction task, is one such task: analysis showed that the application of a parser correlated with high rank in the task CITATION,,
4.3 GENIA treebank processing For comparison and evaluation, the texts in the GENIA treebank CITATION are converted to the various formats as follows,,
2 Bio-molecular Event Extraction In this study, we adopt the event extraction task defined in the BioNLP 2009 Shared Task CITATION as a model information extraction task,,
5.2 Stanford Dependency Setting SD have four different variants: basic dependencies (BD), collapsed dependencies (CD), collapsed dependencies with propagation of conjunct dependencies (CDP), and collapsed tree dependencies (CTD) (de Marneffe and CITATION),,

GDep and Enju with PAS are used for the evaluation, which is the same evaluation setting with the original system by CITATIONb),,
The BioNLP09 shared task involved documents contained also in the GENIA treebank CITATION, creating an opportunity for direct study of intrinsic and task-oriented evaluation results,,
The output of C&C can be converted into SD by a rule-based conversion script CITATION,,
Parser comparison has also been proposed on specific tasks such as unbounded dependencies CITATION and textual entailment (O,,

Parser comparison has also been proposed on specific tasks such as unbounded dependencies CITATION and textual entailment (Onder CITATION)7,,
6 Related Work Many approaches for parser comparison have been proposed, and most comparisons have used gold treebanks with intermediate formats (CITATION; CITATION),,

For a detailed description of these improvements, we refer to CITATIONa),,
The event extraction system described in Section 2.1 is used with the default settings given in (CITATIONb),,
