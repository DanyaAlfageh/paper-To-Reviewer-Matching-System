 Specifically, we (1) derive world knowledge from encyclopedic sources that are underinvestigated for coreference resolution, including FrameNet CITATION and YAGO CITATION, in addition to coreference-annotated data and unannotated data; (2) incorporate such knowledge as features into a richer baseline feature set that we previously employed CITATION; and (3) evaluate their utility using two coreference models, the traditional mention-pair model CITATION and the recently developed cluster-ranking model CITATION,,

 Since knowledge extraction from webbased encyclopedia is typically noisy CITATION, we use YAGO to determine whether two NPs have a relation only if one NP is a named entity (NE) of type person, organization, or location according to the Stanford NE recognizer CITATION and the other NP is a common noun,,

 First, can world knowledge still offer benefits when used in combination with a richer set of features? Second, since automatically extracted world knowledge is typically noisy CITATION, are recently-developed coreference models more noisetolerant than the mention-pair model, and if so, can they profit more from the noisily extracted world knowledge? Finally, while different world knowl814 \x0cedge sources have been shown to be useful when applied in isolation to a coreference system, do they offer complementary benefits and therefore can further improve a resolver when applied in combination? We seek answers to these questions by conducting a systematic evaluation of different world knowledge sources for learning-based coreference resolution,,

 However, the use of related verbs is similar in spirit to Bean and Riloffs (2004) use of patterns for inducing contextual role knowledge, and the use of semantic roles is also discussed in CITATION,,
 Second, since FrameNet-style semantic role labelers are not publicly available, we use ASSERT CITATION, a semantic role labeler that provides PropBank-style semantic roles such as ARG0 (the PROTOAGENT, which is typically the subject of a transitive verb) and ARG1 (the PROTOPATIENT, which is typically its direct object),,
 Specifically, we (1) derive world knowledge from encyclopedic sources that are underinvestigated for coreference resolution, including FrameNet CITATION and YAGO CITATION, in addition to coreference-annotated data and unannotated data; (2) incorporate such knowledge as features into a richer baseline feature set that we previously employed CITATION; and (3) evaluate their utility using two coreference models, the traditional mention-pair model CITATION and the recently developed cluster-ranking model CITATION,,
