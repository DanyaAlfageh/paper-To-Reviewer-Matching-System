2.4 Evaluation Measures We employ two commonly-used scoring programs, B3 CITATION and CEAF CITATION, both of which report results in terms of recall (R), precision (P), and F-measure (F) by comparing the gold-standard (i.e., key) partition, KP, against the system-generated (i.e., response) partition, RP.,,

This is not the case when automatically extracted NPs are used, but the original description of B3 does not specify how twinless NPs should be scored CITATION.,,
Specifically, we (1) derive world knowledge from encyclopedic sources that are underinvestigated for coreference resolution, including FrameNet CITATION and YAGO CITATION, in addition to coreference-annotated data and unannotated data; (2) incorporate such knowledge as features into a richer baseline feature set that we previously employed CITATION; and (3) evaluate their utility using two coreference models, the traditional mention-pair model CITATION and the recently developed cluster-ranking model CITATION.,,

We combine the extractions produced by CITATION and CITATION to form a database consisting of 1.057 million NP pairs, and create a binary-valued feature for our coreference models using this database.,,

However, the use of related verbs is similar in spirit to Bean and Riloffs (2004) use of patterns for inducing contextual role knowledge, and the use of semantic roles is also discussed in CITATION.,,
Second, since FrameNet-style semantic role labelers are not publicly available, we use ASSERT CITATION, a semantic role labeler that provides PropBank-style semantic roles such as ARG0 (the PROTOAGENT, which is typically the subject of a transitive verb) and ARG1 (the PROTOPATIENT, which is typically its direct object).,,
