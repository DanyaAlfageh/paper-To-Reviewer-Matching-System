Therefore, we automatically construct lexical chains of WordNet relations from \x01 s constituents to s CITATION,,
The deeper analysis of the systems output 11 For the RTE 2005 data, we list the confidence-weighted score (cws) CITATION and, for the RTE 2006 data, the average precision (ap) measure CITATION,,
3.1 Logic Form Transformation In the first stage of our representation process, COGEX converts \x01 and into logic forms CITATION,,
 logic translation of the DRS language used in Discourse Representation Theory CITATION and uses a theorem prover and a model builder with some generic, lexical and geographical background knowledge to prove the entailment between the two texts,,
Trying to boost research in textual inferences, the PASCAL Network proposed the Recognizing Textual Entailment (RTE) challenges (CITATION; CITATION),,
CITATION represents \x01 and into a first-order logic translation of the DRS language used in Discourse Representation Theory CITATION and uses a theorem prover and a model builder with some generic, lexical and geographical background knowledge to prove the entailment between the two texts,,
In order to objectively evaluate our representation, we derived it from two different sources: constituency parse trees (generated with our implementation of CITATION) and dependency parse trees (created using Minipar CITATION)1,,
Additionally, the prover uses a SUMO knowledge base of temporal reasoning axioms that consists of axioms for a representation of time points and time intervals, Allen CITATION primitives, and temporal functions,,
2 Cogex - A Logic Prover for NLP Our system uses COGEX CITATION, a natural language prover originating from OTTER CITATION,,
5 Semantic Calculus The Semantic Calculus axioms combine two semantic relations identified within a text fragment and increase the semantic connectivity of the text CITATION,,
10 CITATION lists the exact number of possible combinations for several WordNet relations and part-of-speech classes,,
(de Salvo CITATION) proposes a Description Logic-based knowledge representation language used to induce the representations of \x01 and and uses an extended subsumption algorithm to check if any of \x01 s representations obtained through equivalent transformations entails ,,
821 \x0cpredicates are derived from both the detected semantic relations as well as from a module which utilizes a learning algorithm to detect temporally ordered events (\x03\x01 \x04\x03\x02\x05\x04 \x04\x03\x02\x07\x06 \x06, where is the temporal signal linking two events \x02 \x04 and \x02 \x06 ) CITATION,,
eory CITATION and uses a theorem prover and a model builder with some generic, lexical and geographical background knowledge to prove the entailment between the two texts,,
