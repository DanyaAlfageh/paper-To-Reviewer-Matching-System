1 Introduction

<bodyText confidence="0.999523218181818">
It is critical for physicians and other healthcare
providers to have complete and accurate knowl-
edge of the medical history of patients that in-
cludes disease/symptom progression over time and
related tests/treatments in chronological order.
While various types of clinical records (e.g., dis-
charge summaries, consultation notes, etc.) contain
comprehensive medical history information, it can
be often challenging and time-consuming to com-
prehend the medical history of patients when the
information is stored in multiple documents in dif-
ferent formats and the relations among various
pieces of information is not explicit.
For decades, researchers have investigated tem-
poral information extraction and reasoning in the
medical domain (Zhou and Hripcsak, 2007). How-
ever, information extraction in the medical domain
typically relies on shallow NLP techniques (e.g.,
pattern matching, chunking, templates, etc.), and
most temporal reasoning techniques are based on
structured data with temporal tags (Augusto, 2005;
Stacey and McGregor, 2007).
In this paper, we present our work on develop-
ing an end-to-end system that (i) extracts interest-
ing medical concepts (e.g., medical conditions/
tests/treatments), related events and temporal ex-
pressions from raw clinical text records, (ii) con-
structs timelines of the extracted information; and
(iii) visualizes the timelines, all using deep seman-
tic natural language understanding (NLU).
Our deep NLU system extracts rich semantic
information from narrative text records and builds
logical forms that contain ontology types as well as
linguistic features. Ontology- and pattern-based
extraction rules are used on the logical forms to
retrieve time points/intervals, medical concepts/
events and their temporal/causal relations that are
pieced together by our systems temporal reasoning
component to create comprehensive timelines.
Our system is an extension to a well-proven
general-purpose NLP system (Allen et al., 2000)
rather than a system specialized to the clinical do-
main, and the temporal reasoning in our system is
tightly integrated into the NLP systems deep se-
mantic analysis. We believe this approach will al-
low us to process a broader variety of documents
and complex forms of temporal expressions.
In the coming sections, we first present a moti-
vating example, a real clinical record of a cancer
patient. Next, we give an overview of our NLU
system including how medical ontology is inte-
grated into our system. The overview section is
followed by detailed description of our information
extraction and temporal reasoning approach. Then,
we discuss our results and conclude.

<bodyText confidence="0.969645571428571">
Our work is carried out as a collaboration with the
Moffitt Cancer Center (part of the NCI Compre-
hensive Cancer Centers), who have provided us
with access to clinical records for over 1500 pa-
tients. Figure 1 shows a (de-identified) History of
Present Illness (HPI) section of a Thoracic Con-
sultation Note from this data set.

\x0cThe text of this section provides a very detailed
description of what problems/tests/treatments an
anonymous cancer patient went through over a pe-
riod. Such narrative text is common in clinical
notes and, because such notes are carefully created
by physicians, they tend to have only relevant in-
formation about patient medical history.
Nonetheless, there are lots of challenges in con-
structing complete and accurate medical history
because of complex temporal expressions/
relations, medical language specific grammar/
jargons, implicit information and domain-specific
medical knowledge (Zhou and Hripcsak, 2007).
In this paper, as an initial step towards con-
structing complete timelines from narrative text,
we focus on sentences with explicit temporal ex-
pressions listed below (tagged as Line 1 ~ 11) plus
a sentence in the present tense (Line 12):1

Line 5: She states that prior to starting the Afini-

tor she had no shortness of breath or dyspnea on
exertion and she was quite active.
Line 6: Unfortunately 4 weeks after starting the
Afinitor she developed a dry cough and progres-
sive shortness of breath with dyspnea on exer-
tion.
Line 7: She received a 5 day dose pack of
prednisone and was treated with Augmentin in
05/2008.
Line 8: She subsequently had a CT scan of the
chest done on 05/14/08 that showed interval de-
velopment of bilateral lower lobe infiltrates that
were not present on the 02/19/08 scan.
Line 9: Because of her respiratory symptoms, the
Afinitor was stopped on 05/18/2008.
Line 10: Prior to the Afinitor she was able to
walk, do gardening, and swim without any
shortness of breath.
Line 11: She has had a 140 pound weight since
10/2007.
Line 12: She denies fevers, chills, hemoptysis or
chest pain.
In these 12 sentences, there are instances of 10
treatments (e.g., procedures such as nephrectomy
and drugs such as Nexavar), 3 tests (e.g., CT-
scan), 13 problems/symptoms (e.g., lung nodules)
and 2 other types of clinical findings (e.g., the can-
cer stage level T3 NX MX). There are also 23
events of various types represented with verbs such
as had, was, showed, and was started.
While there are simple expressions such as on
03/05/08 in Line 3, there are also temporal ex-
pressions in more complex forms with time rela-
tions (e.g., prior to), time references (e.g., at
that time) or event references (e.g., 4 weeks after
starting Afinitor). Throughout this paper, we will
use Line 1 ~ 12 as a concrete example based on
which we develop general techniques to construct
timelines.

nephrectomy in 09/2007; pathological stage at that time was a T3 NX MX. Prior to her surgery CT
scan in 08/2007 showed lung nodules. These nodules have progressed with time. She was placed
on Nexavar in 11/2007. She subsequently was found to have a new mass in her left nephrectomy
bed. She was continued on the Nexavar, however, she showed radiographic progression and the
Nexavar was discontinued. She was started on Afinitor on 03/05/08. She states that prior to starting

VITAL SIGNS: Blood pressure 131/74, pulse 106, respiratory rate 20, temperature 97.3, weight
64.0 kg.
HEENT: Pupils equal, round, reactive to light. Extraocular muscles were intact. Nose and mouth
were clear.
NECK: Trachea midline. Carotids were 2 plus. No masses, thyromegaly or adenopathy.
LUNGS: Respirations were unlabored. There is no dullness to percussion or tenderness to
palpation. She has some bibasilar dry rales.
HEART: Regular rate and rhythm without murmur.
ABDOMEN: Soft, positive bowel sounds, nontender.
EXTREMITIES: No clubbing or cyanosis. She had some mild pedal edema.
DATABASE:
Chest x ray from 06/01/08 was reviewed. She had bilateral lower lobe patchy densities. She had
some nodular densities bilaterally as well. There is widening of the mediastinum on the right. CT
scan of the chest from 05/14/08 also was reviewed. She had bilateral lower lobe infiltrates that were
new. She had mediastinal and right hilar adenopathy. She had multiple lung nodules. There is
recurrent tumor in the left renal bed that was thought to be larger.
IMPRESSION:
1. Metastatic renal cancer with multiple lung nodules with mediastinal and hilar adenopathy.
2. Bilateral lower lobe infiltrates. These infiltrates had developed after starting the Afinitor, as did
her shortness of breath and dyspnea on exertion. She recently started on oxygen by her primary
care physician when she was found to have exercise O2 saturations of 86%. She is currently taking
2 liters of oxygen. I would be concerned that the infiltrates may be related to pneumonitis from the
Afinitor. I also think her shortness of breath, cough and hypoxemia are related to the infiltrates as
well.
RECOMMENDATIONS:
1. I reviewed my impressions with the patient.
2. I am going to schedule her for a bronchoscopy and bronchoalveolar lavage. I am going to get
baseline pulmonary function tests on her.
3. She will be seen by Dr. XXX on 08/12/08. I will call and discuss the case with him pending the
above results. The options are likely going to be observation off Afinitor or may consider placing her
on prednisone, if the bronchoalveolar lavage is unremarkable.
4. Further recommendations will be made after the above.

\x0c3 Natural Language Understanding
(NLU) System
</figure>
<bodyText confidence="0.991469571428572">
Our system is an extension to an existing NLU sys-
tem that is the result of a decade-long research ef-
fort in developing generic natural language tech-
nology. The system uses a deep understanding
approach, attempting to find a linked, overall
meaning for all the words in a paragraph. An archi-
tectural view of the system is shown in Figure 2.
</bodyText>
<subsectionHeader confidence="0.996919">
3.1 Core NLU Components
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999623833333333">
At the core of the system is a packed-forest chart
parser which builds constituents bottom-up using a
best-first search strategy. The core grammar is a
hand-built, lexicalized context-free grammar, aug-
mented with feature structures and feature unifica-
tion. The parser draws on a general purpose seman-
tic lexicon and ontology which define a range of
word senses and lexical semantic relations. The
core semantic lexicon was constructed by hand and
contains more than 7000 lemmas. It can be also
dynamically augmented for unknown words by
consulting WordNet (Miller, 1995).
To support more robust processing as well as
domain configurability, the core system is in-
formed by a variety of statistical and symbolic pre-
processors. These include several off-the-shelf sta-
tisical NLP tools such as the Stanford POS tagger
(Toutanova and Manning, 2000), the Stanford
named-entity recognizer (NER) (Finkel et al.,
2005) and the Stanford Parser (Klein and Manning,
2003). The output of these and other specialized
preprocessors (such as a street address recognizer)
are sent to the parser as advice. The parser then can
include or not include this advice (e.g., that a cer-
tain phrase is a named entity) as it searches for the
optimal parse of the sentence.
The result of parsing is a frame-like semantic
representation that we call the Logical Form (LF).
The LF representation includes semantic types,
semantic roles for predicate arguments, and de-
pendency relations. Figure 3 shows an LF example
for the sentence She had a left radical nephrec-
tomy in 09/2007. In the representation, elements
that start with colons (e.g., :THEME) are semantic
roles of ontological concepts, and role values can
be a variable to refer to another LF term.

3.2 UMLS Integration
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.989974318181818">
By far the most critical aspect of porting our ge-
neric NLU components to the task of understand-
ing clinical text is the need for domain-specific
lexical and ontologic information. One widely used
comprehensive resource that can provide both is
the National Library of Medicines Unified Medi-
cal Language System (UMLS) (Bodenreider,
2004). UMLS was integrated into or system via
MetaMap (Aronson and Lang, 2010), a tool also
developed by NLM, that can identify and rank
UMLS concepts in text.
Specifically, we added MetaMap as a special
kind of named entity recognizer feeding advice
into the Parsers input chart (see Figure 2). We run
MetaMap twice on the input text to obtain UMLS
information both for the maximal constituents, and
for individual words in those constituents (e.g.,
lung cancer, as well as lung and cancer).
The lexicon constructs representations for the
new words and phrases on the fly. Our general ap-
proach for dealing with how the corresponding
concepts fit in our system ontology uses an ontol-

\x0cogy specialization mechanism which we call on-
tology grafting, whereby new branches are created
from third party ontological sources, and attached
to appropriate leaf nodes in our ontology.
The UMLS Semantic Network and certain vo-
cabularies included in the UMLS Metathesaurus
define concept hierarchies along multiple axes.
First, we established links between the 15 UMLS
semantic groups and corresponding concepts in our
ontology. Second, we selected a list of nodes from
the SNOMED-CT and NCI hierarchies (27 and 11
nodes, respectively) and formed ontological
branches rooted in these nodes that we grafted onto
our ontology.
Based on these processes, UMLS information
gets integrated into our LF representation. In Fig-

<bodyText confidence="0.9974555">
In this section, we describe how to extract basic
elements that will be used as a foundation to con-
struct timelines. We first describe our general ap-

Then we give details specific to the various types
of information we extract in our system: various

4.1 LF Pattern-based Extraction
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.977358">
Given LF outputs from the NLU system described
in Section 3, we use LF pattern-based rules for in-
formation extraction. The basic structure of an ex-
traction rule is a list of LF patterns followed by a
unique rule ID and the output specification.
Each LF-pattern specifies a pattern against an
LF. Variables can appear anywhere except as role
names in different formats:
</bodyText>
<equation confidence="0.292409">
?x - (unconstrained) match anything
?!x - match any non-null value
(? x V1 V2 ...) - (constrained) match one of the
</equation>
<bodyText confidence="0.9896015">
specified values V1, V2, ...
As an example, the extraction rule in Figure 4
will match LFs that mean a person had a treatment
or a medical-diagnostic with explicit UMLS in-
formation (i.e., part of LFs in Figure 3 matches).
The output specification records critical informa-
tion from the extraction to be used by other rea-
soners.
The extraction rules have all been developed by
hand. Nevertheless, they are quite general, since a)
LF patterns abstract away from lexical and syntac-
tic variability in the broad class of expressions of
interest (however, lexical and syntactic features
may be used if needed); and b) LF patterns make
heavy use of ontological categories, which pro-
vides abstraction at the semantic level.

concept (as mentioned already, subclasses such as
pharmacologic substances, would also match).
The rule in Figure 5 checks the :quantifier role
and its value (e.g., none) is used to infer the pres-
ence or the absence of concepts. Using similar
rules, we extract additional concepts such as
medical-disorders-and-conditions, physical-
symptom, treatment, medical-diagnostic, medical-
action and clinical-finding. Here, medical-action
and clinical-finding are to extract concepts in a
broader sense.2 To cover additional concepts, we
can straightforwardly update extraction rules.

Temporal expressions are also extracted in the
same way but using different LF patterns. We have
14 rules to extract dates and time-spans of varying
levels of complexity; for the example in Figure 1
six of these rules were applied. Figure 6 shows LF
patterns for a rule to extract temporal expressions
of the form until X days/months/years ago; for
example, here is what the rule extracts for until 3
days ago:

4.4 Event Extraction
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999770964285714">
To construct timelines, the concepts of interest
(Section 4.2) and the temporal expressions (Sec-
tion 4.3) should be pieced together. For that pur-
pose, it is critical to extract events because they not
only describe situations that happen or occur but
also represent states or circumstances where some-
thing holds. Furthermore, event features provide
useful cues to reason about situations surrounding
extracted clinical concepts.
Here, we do not formally define events, but refer
to (Sauri et al., 2006) for detailed discussion about
events. While events can be expressed by multiple
means (e.g., verbs, nominalizations, and adjec-
tives), our extraction rules for events focus on
verbs and their features such as class, tense, aspect,
and polarity. Figure 7 shows a rule to extract an
event with the verb start like the one in Line 4,
She was started on Afinitor on 03/05/08. The
output specification from this rule for Line 4 will
have the :class, :tense, and :passive roles as (aspec-
tual initiation), past, and true respectively.
These event features play a critical role in con-
structing timelines (Section 5). For instance, the
event class (aspectual initiation) from applying the
rule in Figure 7 to Line 4 implies that the concept
Afinitor (a pharmacologic-substance) is not just
something tried on the given date, 03/05/08, but
something that continued from that date.

4.5 Relation Information Extraction
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.965435625">
The relations among extracted concepts (namely,
conjoined relations between events and set rela-
tions between clinical concepts) also play a key
role in our approach. When events or clinical con-
cepts are closely linked with such relations, heuris-
tically, they tend to share similar properties that are
exploited in constructing timelines as described in
Section 5.

concept categorization like the one specified in the 2010 i2b2/VA Challenge (https://www.i2b2.org/NLP/Relations/)

\x0cfoundation to construct timelines that represent
patients medical history. In this section, we pre-
sent timeline construction processes (as shown in
Figure 8), using example sentences from Section 2.
Step 1: We first make connections between events
</figureCaption>
<bodyText confidence="0.993317703125">
and clinical concepts. In the current system, events
and clinical concepts are extracted in separate rules
and their relations are not always explicit in the
output specification of the rules applied. For in-
stance, Figure 9 shows LFs for the sentence in Line
7 in a graph format, using simplified LF terms for
illustration. The clinical concept prednisone and
the event received get extracted by different
rules and the relation between them is not explicit
in their output specifications.
To address such a case, for a pair of an event
and a clinical concept, we traverse LF graphs and
decide that a relation between them exists if there
is a path that goes through certain pre-defined con-
cepts that do not separate them semantically and
syntactically (e.g., concepts of measure-units,
evidence/history, development, and some proposi-
tions).
Step 2: Second, we find temporal expressions as-
sociated with events. This step is relatively
straightforward. While temporal expressions and
events get extracted separately, by investigating
their LFs, we can decide if a given temporal ex-
pression is a modifier of an event. In Figure 9, the
time-span-relation (i.e., in) in the dotted-line box
is a direct modifier of the event was treated.
Step 3: Next, we propagate the association be-
tween events and temporal expressions. That is,
when the relation between an event and a temporal
expression is found, we check if the temporal ex-
pression can be associated with additional events
related to the event (esp. when the related events
do not have any associated temporal expression).
In Figure 9, the event received does not have a
temporal expression as a modifier. However, it is
conjoined with the event was treated in the same
past tense under the same speech act. Thus, we let
the event received share the same temporal ex-
pression with its conjoined event. Here, the con-
joined relation was extracted with relation rules
described in Section 4.5, which allows us to focus
on only related events.
Step 4: When temporal expressions do not have
concrete time values within the expressions, we
need to designate times for them by looking into
information in their LFs:
Event references: The system needs to find the
referred event and gets its time value. For in-
stance, in 4 weeks after starting Afinitor (Line
6), starting Afinitor refers to a previous event
in Line 4. The system investigates all events with
a verb with the same- or sub-type of ont::start
and Afinitor as its object (active verbs) or its
subject (passive verbs). After resolving event
references, additional time reference or relation
computation may be required (e.g., computation
for 4 weeks after).
Time references: Concrete times for expressions
like the above example N weeks after
&lt;reference-time&gt; can be easily computed by
checking the time displacement information in
LFs with the reference time. However, expres-
sions such as N days ago are based on the
context of clinical records (e.g., record creation

\x0ctime). Document creation time is usually repre-
sented as metadata attached to the document it-
self, or it could be retrieved from a database
where clinical records are stored. In addition,
previously mentioned dates or time-spans can be
referred to using pronouns (e.g., at that/this
time). For such expressions, we heuristically
decide that it refers to the most recent temporal
expression.
Time relation: Some temporal expressions have
directional time relations (e.g., until, prior
to, and after) specifying intervals with open
ends. When the ending time of a time span is not
specified (e.g., since 10/2007 in Line 10). We
heuristically set it from the context of the clinical
record such as the document creation time.
Step 5: Finally, we designate or compute times on
or during which the presence or the absence of
each clinical concept is asserted. Since temporal
expressions are associated with events, to find time
values for clinical concepts, we first check the rela-
tions between events and clinical concepts. When
an event with a concrete time is found for a clinical
concept, the events class is examined. For classes
such as state and occurrence, the concrete time
value of the event is used. In contrast, for an aspec-
tual event, we check its feature (e.g., initiation or
termination) and look for other aspectual events
related to the clinical concept and compute a time
span. For instance, regarding Afinitor, Line 4
and Line 9 have events with classes (aspectual ini-
tiation) and (aspectual termination) respectively,
which leads to a time span between the two dates
in Line 4 and Line 9. Currently, we do not resolve
conflicting hypotheses.
Assertion of Presence or Absence of Clinical
Concepts: To check if a certain concept is present
or not, we take into account quantifier information
(e.g., none), the negation role values of events, and
the verb types of events (e.g., deny indicates the
absence assertion). In addition to such information
readily available in the output specifications of the
clinical concept- and event-extraction rules, we
also check the path (as in Step 1) that relates the
clinical concepts and the events, and the quantifiers
of the concepts in the path are used to compute
negation values. For instance, given The scan
shows no evidence of lung nodules, the quantifier
of the concept evidence indicates the absence of
the clinical finding lung nodules.

For the example in Section 2 (Line 1 ~ 12), we ex-
tract all the instances of the clinical concepts and
the temporal expressions. Out of 23 events, 17
were extracted. While we missed events such as
state/was (Line 5), done (Line 8), and walk/do/
swim (Line 10), our event extraction rules can be
extended to cover them if need be.
Figure 10 visualizes the extraction results of the
example. We use a web widget tool called Simile
Timeline (www.simile-widgets.org/timeline/).
Some property values (that were also extracted by
rules) are shown alongside some concepts (e.g.,
weight measurement). Note that not all extracted
clinical findings are displayed in Figure 10 because
we visualize clinical concepts only when they are
associated with temporal expressions in our LFs.
For instance, the CT-scan on 05/14/08 in Line 8 is
not shown because the date was not associated
with it due to fragmented LFs from the Parser.

Temporal information is of crucial importance in
clinical applications, which is why it has attracted
a lot interest over the last two decades or more
(Augusto, 2005). Since so much clinical informa-
tion is still residing in unstructured form, in par-
ticular as text in the patients health record, the last
decade has seen a number of serious efforts in
medical NLP in general (Meystre et al., 2008) and
in extracting temporal information from clinical
text in particular.
Some of this surge in interest has been spurred
by dedicated competitions on extraction of con-
cepts and events from clinical text (such as the
i2b2 NLP challenges). At the same time, the evolu-
tion of temporal markup languages such as Ti-
meML (Sauri et al., 2006), and temporal
extraction/inference competitions (such as the two
TempEval challenges, Verhagen et al., 2009) in the
general area of NLP have led to the development
of tools such as TARSQI (Verhagen et al., 2005)
that could be adapted to the clinical domain.
Although the prevailing paradigm in this area is
to use superficial methods for extracting and clas-
sifying temporal expressions, it has long been rec-
ognized that higher level semantic processing, in-
cluding discourse-level analysis, would have to be
performed to get past the limits of the current ap-
proaches (cf. Zhou and Hripcsak, 2007).
Recent attempts to use deeper linguistic features
include the work of Bethard et al. (2007), who
used syntactic structure in addition to lexical and
some minor semantic features to classify temporal
relations of the type we discussed in Section 4.3.
Savova and her team have also expressed interest
in testing off-the-shelf deep parsers and semantic
role labelers for aiding in temporal relation identi-
fication and classification (Savova et al., 2009);
although we are not aware of any temporal extrac-
tion results yet, we appreciate their effort in ex-
panding the TimeML annotation schema for the
clinical domain, as well as their efforts in develop-
ing corpora of clinical text annotated with temporal
information.
The work of Mulkar-Mehta et al. (2009) also
deserves a mention, even though they apply their
techniques to biomedical text rather than clinical
text. They obtain a shallow logical form that repre-
sents predicate-argument relations implicit in the
syntax by post-processing the results of a statistical
parser. Temporal relations are obtained from the
shallow LF based on a set of hand-built rules by an
abductive inference engine.
To our knowledge, however, our system is the
first general-purpose NLU system that produces a
full, deep syntactic and semantic analysis of the
text as a prerequisite to the extraction and analysis
of relevant clinical and temporal information.

Our deep NLU system extracts rich semantic information from narrative text records and builds logical forms that contain ontology types as well as linguistic features. Ontology- and pattern-based extraction rules are used on the logical forms to retrieve time points/intervals, medical concepts/ events and their temporal/causal relations that are pieced together by our systems temporal reasoning component to create comprehensive timelines. Our system is an extension to a well-proven general-purpose NLP system (Allen et al., 2000) rather than a system specialized to the clinical domain, and the temporal reasoning in our system is tightly integrated into the NLP systems deep semantic analysis.

However, information extraction in the medical domain typically relies on shallow NLP techniques (e.g., pattern matching, chunking, templates, etc.), and most temporal reasoning techniques are based on structured data with temporal tags (Augusto, 2005; Stacey and McGregor, 2007). In this paper, we present our work on developing an end-to-end system that (i) extracts interesting medical concepts (e.g., medical conditions/ tests/treatments), related events and temporal expressions from raw clinical text records, (ii) constructs timelines of the extracted information; and (iii) visualizes the timelines, all using deep semantic natural language understanding (NLU).

In the representation, elements that start with colons (e.g., :THEME) are semantic roles of ontological concepts, and role values can be a variable to refer to another LF term. 3.2 UMLS Integration By far the most critical aspect of porting our generic NLU components to the task of understanding clinical text is the need for domain-specific lexical and ontologic information. One widely used comprehensive resource that can provide both is the National Library of Medicines Unified Medical Language System (UMLS) (Bodenreider, 2004). UMLS was integrated into or system via MetaMap (Aronson and Lang, 2010), a tool also developed by NLM, that can identify and rank UMLS concepts in text. Specifically, we added MetaMap as a special kind of named entity recognizer feeding advice into the Parsers input chart (see Figure 2). We run MetaMap twice on the input text to obtain UMLS information both for the maximal constituents, and for individual words in those constituents (e.g., lung cancer, as well as lung and cancer). The lexicon constructs representations for the new words and phrases on the fly. Our general approach for dealin</context>

The work of Mulkar-Mehta et al. (2009) also deserves a mention, even though they apply their techniques to biomedical text rather than clinical text. They obtain a shallow logical form that represents predicate-argument relations implicit in the syntax by post-processing the results of a statistical parser. Temporal relations are obtained from the shallow LF based on a set of hand-built rules by an abductive inference engine.

For that purpose, it is critical to extract events because they not only describe situations that happen or occur but also represent states or circumstances where something holds. Furthermore, event features provide useful cues to reason about situations surrounding extracted clinical concepts. Here, we do not formally define events, but refer to (Sauri et al., 2006) for detailed discussion about events. While events can be expressed by multiple means (e.g., verbs, nominalizations, and adjectives), our extraction rules for events focus on verbs and their features such as class, tense, aspect, and polarity. Figure 7 shows a rule to extract an event with the verb start like the one in Line 4, She was started on Afinitor on 03/05/08. The output specification from this rule for Line 4 will have the :class, :tense, and :passive roles as (aspectual initiation), past, and true respectively.

In this paper, we present our work on developing an end-to-end system that (i) extracts interesting medical concepts (e.g., medical conditions/ tests/treatments), related events and temporal expressions from raw clinical text records, (ii) constructs timelines of the extracted information; and (iii) visualizes the t</context>
<context position="4471" citStr="Zhou and Hripcsak, 2007" startWordPosition="650" endWordPosition="653">et. 146 \x0cThe text of this section provides a very detailed description of what problems/tests/treatments an anonymous cancer patient went through over a period. Such narrative text is common in clinical notes and, because such notes are carefully created by physicians, they tend to have only relevant information about patient medical history. Nonetheless, there are lots of challenges in constructing complete and accurate medical history because of complex temporal expressions/ relations, medical language specific grammar/ jargons, implicit information and domain-specific medical knowledge (Zhou and Hripcsak, 2007). In this paper, as an initial step towards constructing complete timelines from narrative text, we focus on sentences with explicit temporal expressions listed below (tagged as Line 1 ~ 11) plus a sentence in the present tense (Line 12):1 Line 1: She had a left radical nephrectomy in 09/ 2007; pathological stage at that time was a T3 NX MX. Line 2: Prior to her surgery CT scan in 08/2007 showed lung nodules. Line 3: She was placed on Nexavar in 11/2007. Line 4: She was started on Afinitor on 03/05/08. Line 5: She states that prior to starting the Afinitor she had no shortness of breath or dys</context>

Although the prevailing paradigm in this area is to use superficial methods for extracting and classifying temporal expressions, it has long been recognized that higher level semantic processing, including discourse-level analysis, would have to be performed to get past the limits of the current approaches (cf. Zhou and Hripcsak, 2007). Recent attempts to use deeper linguistic features include the work of Bethard et al. (2007), who used syntactic structure in addition to lexical and some minor semantic features to classify temporal relations of the type we discussed in Section 4.3. Savova and her team have also expressed interest in testing off-the-shelf deep parsers and semantic role labelers for aiding in temporal relation identification and classification (Savova et al., 2009); although we are not aware of any temporal extraction results yet, we appreciate their effort in expanding the TimeML annotation schema for the cl</context>
