 Our system is an extension to a well-proven general-purpose NLP system CITATION rather than a system specialized to the clinical domain, and the temporal reasoning in our system is tightly integrated into the NLP systems deep semantic analysis,,
 For decades, researchers have investigated temporal information extraction and reasoning in the medical domain CITATION,,
), and most temporal reasoning techniques are based on structured data with temporal tags (CITATION; CITATION),,
 7 Related Work Temporal information is of crucial importance in clinical applications, which is why it has attracted a lot interest over the last two decades or more CITATION,,
 Since so much clinical information is still residing in unstructured form, in particular as text in the patients health record, the last decade has seen a number of serious efforts in medical NLP in general CITATION and in extracting temporal information from clinical text in particular,,
 At the same time, the evolution of temporal markup languages such as TimeML CITATION, and temporal extraction/inferenc,,
mpEval challenges, CITATION) in the general area of NLP have led to the development of tools such as TARSQI CITATION that could be adapted to the clinical domain,,
 CITATION),,
 Recent attempts to use deeper linguistic features include the work of CITATION, who used syntactic structure in addition to lexical and some minor semantic features to classify temporal relations of the type we discussed in Section 4,,
 One widely used comprehensive resource that can provide both is the National Library of Medicines Unified Medical Language System (UMLS) CITATION,,
 It can be also dynamically augmented for unknown words by consulting WordNet CITATION,,
 These include several off-the-shelf statisical NLP tools such as the Stanford POS tagger CITATION, the Stanford named-entity recognizer (NER) CITATION and the Stanford Parser CITATION,,

 The work of CITATION also deserves a mention, even though they apply their techniques to biomedical text rather than clinical text,,
 Here, we do not formally define events, but refer to CITATION for detailed discussion about events,,
