s of NPs, there have been a lot of work on statistical techniques for lexical dependency parsing of sentences (CITATION; CITATION), and these techniques potentially can be used for analysis of NPs if appropriate resources for NPs are available,,
 Additionally, these methods generally suffer from the difficulty of local estimation from limited contexts and the structural information is difficult to be exploited CITATION,,
 Recently, relational learning methods in general and inductive logic programming (ILP) in particular have attracted a great of attention due to their capability of going beyond finite feature vectors and exploiting unbounded structural information from data (CITATION; Page et al,,
