er, comparing these dependencies to gold-standard dependencies which are available for a subset of 700 sentences randomly drawn from section 23 of the Wall Street Journal (see CITATION),,
Dynamic-programming algorithms that allow the efficient estimation and searching of log-linear models from a packed parse representation without enumerating an exponential number of parses have been recently presented by CITATION and CITATION,,
technology so that all possible syntactic analyses of a sentence are computed in an efficient, packed representation CITATION,,
For a more detailed description of the optimization problem and the feature-functions we use for stochastic LFG parsing see CITATION,,
LFG Conversion We discarded the LFG tree structures and used a general rewriting system previously developed for machine translation to rewrite the relevant f-structure attributes as dependencies (see CITATION),,
2 Stochastic Parsing with LFG 2.1 Parsing with Lexical-Functional Grammar The grammar used for this experiment was developed in the ParGram project CITATION,,
For example, since the Collins parser depends on a prior part-of-speech tagger CITATION, we included the time for POS tagging in our Collins measurements,,
We investigated the accuracy of recovering semantically-relevant grammatical dependencies from the tree-structures produced by the Collins parser, comparing these dependencies to gold-standard dependencies which are available for a subset of 700 sentences randomly drawn from section 23 of the Wall Street Journal (see CITATION),,
As described by CITATION, the annotations were boot-strapped by parsing the sentences with a LFG grammar and transforming the resulting f-structures to a collection of dependency triples in the DEPBANK format,,
The grammar incorporates a version of Optimality Theory that allows certain (sub)rules in the grammar to be prefered or disprefered based on OT marks triggered by the (sub)rule CITATION,,
These algorithms can be readily applied to the packed and/or-forests of CITATION, provided that each conjunctive node is annotated with feature-values of the loglinear model,,
This system not only is frequently used for off-line data preprocessing, but also is included as a black-box component for applications such as document summarization CITATION, information extraction CITATION, machine translation CITATION, and question answering CITATION,,
In the notation of CITATION, such a feature forest is defined as a tuple hC, D, r, , i where C is a set of conjunctive nodes, D is a set of disjunctive nodes, r C is the root node, : D 2C is a conjunctive daughter function, and : C 2D is a disjunctive daughter function,,
This conversion was relatively straightforward for LFG structures CITATION,,
A state-of-the-art statistical parsing system that enjoys great popularity in research systems is the parser described in CITATION (henceforth the Collins parser),,
maximum-entropy) probability model CITATION,,
This system incorporates sophisticated ambiguity-management technology so that all possible syntactic analyses of a sentence are computed in an efficient, packed representation CITATION,,
We compared the output of the XLE system, a deep-grammar-based parsing system using the English Lexical-Functional Grammar previously constructed as part of the Pargram project CITATION, to the same gold standard,,
