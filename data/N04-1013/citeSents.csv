We investigated the accuracy of recovering semantically-relevant grammatical dependencies from the tree-structures produced by the Collins parser, comparing these dependencies to gold-standard dependencies which are available for a subset of 700 sentences randomly drawn from section 23 of the Wall Street Journal (see CITATION),,
We compared the output of the XLE system, a deep-grammar-based parsing system using the English Lexical-Functional Grammar previously constructed as part of the Pargram project CITATION, to the same gold standard,,
This system incorporates sophisticated ambiguity-management technology so that all possible syntactic analyses of a sentence are computed in an efficient, packed representation CITATION,,
2 Stochastic Parsing with LFG 2.1 Parsing with Lexical-Functional Grammar The grammar used for this experiment was developed in the ParGram project CITATION,,
A state-of-the-art statistical parsing system that enjoys great popularity in research systems is the parser described in CITATION (henceforth the Collins parser),,
This system not only is frequently used for off-line data preprocessing, but also is included as a black-box component for applications such as document summarization CITATION, information extraction CITATION, machine translation CITATION, and question answering CITATION,,

The grammar incorporates a version of Optimality Theory that allows certain (sub)rules in the grammar to be prefered or disprefered based on OT marks triggered by the (sub)rule CITATION,,
Dynamic-programming algorithms that allow the efficient estimation and searching of log-linear models from a packed parse representation without enumerating an exponential number of parses have been recently presented by CITATION and CITATION,,
These algorithms can be readily applied to the packed and/or-forests of CITATION, provided that each conjunctive node is annotated with feature-values of the loglinear model,,
In the notation of CITATION, such a feature forest is defined as a tuple hC, D, r, , i where C is a set of conjunctive nodes, D is a set of disjunctive nodes, r C is the root node, : D 2C is a conjunctive daughter function, and : C 2D is a disjunctive daughter function,,

This conversion was relatively straightforward for LFG structures CITATION,,
As described by CITATION, the annotations were boot-strapped by parsing the sentences with a LFG grammar and transforming the resulting f-structures to a collection of dependency triples in the DEPBANK format,,
LFG Conversion We discarded the LFG tree structures and used a general rewriting system previously developed for machine translation to rewrite the relevant f-structure attributes as dependencies (see CITATION),,

For example, since the Collins parser depends on a prior part-of-speech tagger CITATION, we included the time for POS tagging in our Collins measurements,,
