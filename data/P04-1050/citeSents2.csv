The output of text structuring is merely an ordering of these clauses, rather than the tree-like structure of database facts often used in traditional deep generation CITATION,,
The first distinguishing feature is that we assume a search-based approach to text structuring (CITATION; CITATION; CITATION) in which many candidate orderings of clauses are evaluated according to scores assigned by a given metric, an,,
o guide text structuring, in combination with other factors (see CITATION for an overview),,
However, how successful Centerings constraints are on their own in generating a felicitous text structure is an open question, already raised by the seminal papers of the theory (Brennan et al., 1987; CITATION),,
In accordance with recent work in the emerging field of text-to-text generation (CITATION; CITATION), we assume that the input to text structuring is a set of clauses,,
