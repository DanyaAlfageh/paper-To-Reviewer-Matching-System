 2 Maximum Entropy Models Maximum entropy (ME) models (CITATION; CITATION), also known as log-linear and exponential learning models, provide a general purpose machine learning technique for classification and prediction which has been successfully applied to natural language processing including part of speech tagging, named entity recognition etc,,
 This is different to previous work including (CITATION; CITATION) which has suggested a contiguous span of words (a group of turkeys in this example),,
 A syntactic parser CITATION and the Collins rules CITATION are modified to extract such head words,,
 The classic Lesk algorithm CITATION is used to compute the most probable sense for a head word in the question context, and then the hypernyms are extracted based on that sense,,
5 Dependency validity features Like CITATION, we extract the dependency path from the question word to the common word (existing in both question and sentence), and the path from candidate answer (such as CoNLL NE and numerical entity) to the common word for each pair of question and candidate sentence using Stanford dependency parser (CITATION; CITATION),,
 To facilitate the comparison to others work (CITATION; CITATION), we first retrieve all relevant documents which are compiled by Ken Litkowski8 to create training and test datasets,,

 However, due to the lack of a fine grained NER tool at hand, we employ the Stanford NER package CITATION which identifies only four types of named entities,,
1 CoNLL named entities presence feature We use Stanford named entity recognizer (NER) CITATION to identify CoNLL style NEs7 as possible answer strings in a candidate sentence for a given type of question,,
