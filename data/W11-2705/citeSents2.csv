For question classification, we used CITATION taxonomy and a machine learning-based classifier fed with features derived from a rule-based classifier CITATION,,
For the learning of patterns we used the top 64 documents retrieved by Google and to recognize the named entities in the pattern we apply several strategies, namely: 1) the Stanfords Conditional Random-Field-based named entity recognizer CITATION to detect entities of type HUMAN; 2) regular expressions to detect NUMERIC and DATE type entities; 3) gazetteers to detect entities of type LOCATION,,
The syntactic analysis of the questions was done by the Berkeley Parser CITATION trained on the QuestionBank (Judge et al., 2006),,
The Berkeley Parser CITATION was used to parse the sentences, trained with the Wall S,,
