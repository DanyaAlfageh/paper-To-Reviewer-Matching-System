For instance, given the seed Who painted the Birth of Venus ?/Botticelli and the syntactic structure of its question [WHNP Who] [VBD painted] [NP the Birth of Venus]1, we 1 The Penn Treebank II Tags CITATION are used,,
The syntactic analysis of the questions was done by the Berkeley Parser CITATION trained on the QuestionBank (Judge et al., 2006),,
For question classification, we used CITATION taxonomy and a machine learning-based classifier fed with features derived from a rule-based classifier CITATION,,
For the learning of patterns we used the top 64 documents retrieved by Google and to recognize the named entities in the pattern we apply several strategies, namely: 1) the Stanfords Conditional Random-Field-based named entity recognizer CITATION to detect entities of type HUMAN; 2) regular expressions to detect NUMERIC and DATE type entities; 3) gazetteers to detect entities of type LOCATION,,
The Berkeley Parser CITATION was used to parse the sentences, trained with the Wall S,,
The Ceist system CITATION uses syntactic patterns and the Tregex tool CITATION that receives a set of hand-crafted rules and matches the rules against parsed text, generating, in this way, questions (and answers),,
The syntactic analysis of the questions was done by the Berkeley Parser CITATION trained on the QuestionBank (Judge et al., 2006),,

The use of patterns is a widely accepted as an effective approach in the field of Natural Language Processing (NLP), in tasks like Question-Answering (QA) (CITATION; CITATION) or Question Generation (QG) (CITATION; CITATION),,

The use of patterns is a widely accepted as an effective approach in the field of Natural Language Processing (NLP), in tasks like Question-Answering (QA) (CITATION; CITATION) or Question Generation (QG) (CITATION; CITATION),,
Pattern Learning Our approach to pattern learning is inspired by the work of CITATION, who propose a method to learn patterns based on a two-step technique: the first acquires patterns from the Web given a set of seeds and the second validates the patterns,,
