The Stanford CRF-based NER tagger was used as the monolingual component in our models CITATION,,
Our joint alignment and NER decoding approach is inspired by prior work on improving alignment quality through encouraging agreement between bi-directional models (CITATION; CITATION),,
More recently, CITATION and CITATION have shown that combining local prediction models with global consistency models, and enforcing agreement via DD is very effective,,
CITATIONb) presented a new DD method that combines the power of DD with the augmented Lagrangian method,,
Another promising direction for improving NER performance is in enforcing global label consistency across documents, which is an idea that has been greatly explored in the past (CITATION; CITATION; CITATION),,
