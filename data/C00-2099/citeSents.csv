Nothing prevents conditioningthe randomvariableson arbitrary portions of the partial tree generated this far, using, e.g., maximum-entropy or decision-tree models to extract relevant features of it; there is no di\x0berence \x0cin principle between our model and history-based parsing, see (Black et al., 1993; CITATION),,
This is the same separation of arguments and adjuncts as that employed by CITATION,,
1 Introduction The theory of dependency grammar culminated in the seminal book by Lucien Tesni\x12 ere, (Tesni\x12 CITATION), to which also today\&apos;s leading scholars pay homage, see, e.g., (Mel\&apos;\x14 CITATION),,
2 Generating Dependency Trees To describe a tree structure T , we will use a string notation, introduced in CITATION, for the nodes \x0cbeans ate/1 /12 John/11 subj dobj main ,,
The stochastic modelgenerating dependency trees is very similar to other statistical dependency models, e.g., to that of CITATION,,
The top-level control is similar to that of CITATION, pp,,
4.2 The Chart Parser The parsing algorithm, which draws on the CockeKasami-Younger (CKY) algorithm, see CITATION, is formulated as a probabilistic deduction scheme, whichin turn is realized as anagenda-driven chart-parser,,
Schemes like CITATION tacitly make this approximation,,
Here, the dependent stringismerged withthe labelofthe regent, asne ::: pas is wrapped around portions of the verb phrase, e.g., Ne me quitte pas!, see CITATION,,
Unfortunately, Tesni\x12 ere\&apos;s book is only available in French, with a partial translation into German, and subsequent descriptions of his work reported in English, CITATION, CITATION, CITATION, etc., stray increasingly further from the original, see CITATION or (J\x7f CITATION) for an account of this,,
