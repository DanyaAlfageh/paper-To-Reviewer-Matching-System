COMBINER steps follow the same mechanism as those in the algorithm of CITATION, and LINK steps work analogously to those of CITATION, so this schema can be seen as being intermediate between those two algorithms,,
) items are called correct (final) items in the original formulation by CITATION,,
By generalizing the linking steps in Eisner and Sattas parser so that the head of each item can be in any position, we obtain an O(n5 ) parser which can be filtered into the parser of CITATION by eliminating the COMBINER steps,,
3 Derivable items are called valid items in the original formulation by CITATION,,
When described for head automaton grammars CITATION, this algorithm appears to be more complex to understand and implement than the previous one, requiring four different kinds of items to keep track of the state of the automata used by the grammars,,
3.1 CITATION One of the most straightforward projective dependency parsing strategies was introduced by CITATION, and is based on the CYK bottomup parsing strategy (Kasami 1965; Younger 1967),,
