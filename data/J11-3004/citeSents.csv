 For example, the algorithm of Kahane, Nasr, and Rambow (1998) uses a strategy similar to CITATION, but with the following initializer step instead of the INITTER and PREDICTOR: INITTER: [A(), i, i 1] A() P 1 i n The initialization step specified by Kahane, Nasr, and Rambow (1998) differs from this (directly consuming a nonterminal from the input) but this gives an incomplete algorithm,,

 The algorithm Attd where d is finite is not correct with respect to the set of non-projective dependency structures, because it only parses a restricted subset of them CITATION,,
roduced by CITATION, 1993), is a theory of syntax whose structural representation of sentences is closely related to projective dependency representations, but with some important differences,,

 11 A complete treatment of LG is beyond the scope of this article: CITATION gives a detailed comparison of Link Grammar and dependency formalisms,,
 Given the number of indices manipulated in the schema, a nondeterministic implementation of Attd has exponential complexity with respect to input length (though in the implementation of Attardi CITATION, control structures determinize the algorithm),,
 For example, those described by CITATION, CITATION, and Kahane, Nasr, and Rambow (1998) are based on the formalizations of dependency grammar CFG-like rules described by CITATION and CITATION,,
 However, many of the algorithms (CITATION; CITATION) are not traditionally considered to be grammar-driven, because they do not use an explicit formal grammar; decisions about which dependencies to create are taken individually, using probabilistic models CITATION or classifiers CITATION,,
 CITATION), with minor changes to adapt it to dependency grammar (for example, the SCANNER always moves the dot over the head symbol , rather than over a terminal symbol),,
 Analogously, other dependency parsing schemata based on CFG-like rules can be obtained by modifying CFG parsing schemata of CITATION: The algorithm of CITATION can be obtained from the left-corner parser, and the parser described by CITATION is a variant of the head-corner parser,,
6 CITATION CITATION describes a shift-reduce algorithm for projective dependency parsing, later extended by Nivre, Hall, and Nilsson (2004),,
 With linear-time performance and competitive parsing accuracy (CITATION; CITATION), it is one of the parsers included in the MaltParser system CITATION, which is currently widely used (e,,
, CITATION; CITATION),,
 From here, we can follow the procedure described by CITATION to relate this head-corner algorithm to parsers analogous to other algorithms for CFGs,,
 In this way, we can refine the head-corner parser to a variant of the algorithm by de Vreught and Honig (1989) CITATION, and by successive filters we reach a left-corner parser which is equivalent to the one described by CITATION, and a step contraction of the Earley-based dependency parser by Lombardo 556 \x0cGomez-Rodrguez, Carroll, and Weir Dependency Parsing Schemata and Lesmo (1996),,
 The proofs for these relations are the same as those given by CITATION, except that the dependency variants of each algorithm are simpler (due to the absence of epsilon rules and the fact that the rules are lexicalized),,
 When executing this schema with a deductive engine, the parse forest can be recovered by following back pointers, as in constituency parsers CITATION,,
4 MST Parser CITATION McDonald et al,,
 (2005) describe a parser which finds a nonprojective analysis for a sentence in O(n2 ) time under a strong independence assumption called an edgefactored model: Each dependency decision is assumed to be independent of all the others CITATION,,
 Despite the restrictiveness of this model, this maximum spanning tree (MST) parser achieves state-of-the-art performance for projective and non-projective structures (CITATION; CITATION; CITATION),,
 r We adapt the dependency parsing schema framework to the formalism of Link Grammar (CITATION, 1993) (see Section 8),,
 The definition of dependency parsing schemata was first published by Gomez-Rodrguez, Carroll, and Weir CITATION, along with some of the projective schemata presented here and their associated proofs,,

1 CITATION One of the most straightforward projective dependency parsing strategies was introduced by CITATION, and is based on the CYK bottomup parsing strategy (Kasami 1965; Younger 1967),,
 COMBINER steps follow the same mechanism as those in the algorithm of CITATION, and LINK steps work analogously to those of CITATION, so this schema can be seen as being intermediate between those two algorithms,,
 When described for head automaton grammars CITATION, this algorithm appears to be more complex to understand and implement than the previous one, requiring four different kinds of items to keep track of the state of the automata used by the grammars,,
 By generalizing the linking steps in Eisner and Sattas parser so that the head of each item can be in any position, we obtain an O(n5 ) parser which can be filtered into the parser of CITATION by eliminating the COMBINER steps,,
 This is the idea behind the parser defined by CITATION, which is still in wide use today (McDonald, Crammer, and Pereira 2005; CITATION),,

5 Covingtons (1990, 2001) Non-Projective Parser Covingtons non-projective parsing algorithm (CITATION, 2001) reads the input from left to right, establishing dependency links between the current word and previous words in the input,,
7 Covingtons (2001) Projective Parser CITATION defines a non-projective dependency parser, and a projective variant called Algorithm LSUP (for List-based Search with Uniqueness and Projectivity),,
 Unfortunately, the algorithm presented in CITATION is not complete: It does not parse all projective dependency structures, because when creating leftward links it assumes that the head of a node i must be a reflexive-transitive head of the node i 1, which is not always the case,,
 Quoting CITATION, page 99), Because the parser operates one word at a time, unity can only be checked at the end of the whole process: did it produce a tree with a single root that comprises all of the words? Therefore, a postprocessing mechanism is needed to determine which of the generated structures are, in fact, valid trees,,
 Nivre CITATION uses a variant of this algorithm in which cycle detection is used to avoid generating incorrect structures,,

 Conclusions and Future Work The parsing schemata formalism of CITATION has previousl,,
 The parser runs in time O(n7 ), the same complexity as the best existing algorithms for LTAG CITATION, and can be optimized to O(n6 ) in the nonlexicalized case,,
 This complexity with respect to the length of the 568 \x0cGomez-Rodrguez, Carroll, and Weir Dependency Parsing Schemata input is as expected for this set of structures, because CITATION shows that they are equivalent to LTAG, and the best existing parsers for this formalism also perform in O(n7 ) CITATION,,

 In line with the observation that most non-projective structures appearing in practice are only slightly non-projective CITATION, we characterize a sense in which the structures appearing in treebanks are only slightly ill-nested,,
 This has led to the study of sub-classes of the class of all non-projective dependency structures (CITATION; CITATION),,
 CITATION investigates several such classes, based on well-nestedness and gap degree constraints (Bodirsky, Kuhlmann, and Mohl 2005), relating them to lexicalized constituency grammar formalisms,,
 Specifically, Kuhlmann shows that linear context-free rewriting systems 562 \x0cGomez-Rodrguez, Carroll, and Weir Dependency Parsing Schemata (LCFRS) with fan-out k (Vijay-Shanker, Weir, and Joshi 1987; CITATION) induce the set of dependency structures with gap degree at most k 1; coupled CFG in which the maximal rank of a nonterminal is k CITATION induces the set of wellnested dependency structures with gap degree at most k 1; and finally, LTAG CITATION induces the set of well-nested dependency structures with gap degree at most 1,,
 Note that parsing unrestricted ill-nested structures, even when the gap degree is bounded, is NP-complete: These structures are equivalent to LCFRS for which the recognition problem is NP-complete CITATION,,
 We now define the concepts of gap degree and well-nestedness CITATION,,
 Although this covers the vast majority of the structures that occur in natural language treebanks CITATION, a significant number of sentences contain ill-nested structures,,

 This set of structures is closely related to LCFRS with bounded fan-out and unbounded production length, and parsing in this formalism is known to be NP-complete CITATION,,
 Ill-nested structures can be parsed in polynomial time with bounds on the gap degree and the number of dependents allowed per node: CITATION presents a parser based on this idea, using a kind of grammar that resembles LCFRS, called regular dependency grammar,,

 A parsing schema can be used to obtain a working implementation of a parser by using deductive engines such as the ones described by CITATION and Gomez-Rodrguez, Vilares, and Alonso (2009), or the Dyna language (Eisner, Goldlust, and Smith 2005),,
 This implementation has the same tree building logic as the parser described by CITATION, differing from it only with respect to the control structure,,
 CITATION defines various relations between schemata that fall into two categories: generalization relations, which are used to obtain more fine-grained versions of parsers, and filtering relations, which can be seen as the converse of generalization and are used to reduce the number of items and/or steps needed for parsing,,
 From here, we can follow the procedure described by CITATION to relate this head-corner algorithm to parsers analogous to other algorithms for CFGs,,
 In this way, we can refine the head-corner parser to a variant of the algorithm by de Vreught and Honig (1989) CITATION, and by successive filters we reach a left-corner parser which is equivalent to the one described by CITATION, and a step contraction of the Earley-based dependency parser by Lombardo 556 \x0cGomez-Rodrguez, Carroll, and Weir Dependency Parsing Schemata and Lesmo (1996),,

 Following CITATION, items are sets of syntactic structures and tuples are a shorthand notation for such sets, as seen in the previous example,,

 Despite the restrictiveness of this model, this maximum spanning tree (MST) parser achieves state-of-the-art performance for projective and non-projective structures (CITATION; CITATION; CITATION),,
 For example, those described by CITATION, CITATION, and Kahane, Nasr, and Rambow (1998) are based on the formalizations of dependency grammar CFG-like rules described by CITATION and CITATION,,
 However, many of the algorithms (CITATION; CITATION) are not traditionally considered to be grammar-driven, because they do not use an explicit formal grammar; decisions about which dependencies to create are taken individually, using probabilistic models CITATION or classifiers CITATION,,
 To express such algorithms as deduction systems, we use the notion of D-rules CITATION,,
 For example, each member of the item [1, 5] in the item set of the parser by CITATION that will be explained in Section 3,,
 Following CITATION, items are sets of syntactic structures and tuples are a shorthand notation for such sets, as seen in the previous example,,
 When described for head automaton grammars CITATION, this algorithm appears to be more complex to understand and implement than the previous one, requiring four different kinds of items to keep track of the state of the automata used by the grammars,,

 We must verify that every deduction step in the CITATION schema can be emulated by a sequence of inferences in the CITATION schema,,
 \x02 Note that, in practice, these two relations mean that the parsers by CITATION and CITATION are more efficient, at the schema level, than that of CITATION, in that they generate fewer items and need fewer steps to perform the same deductions,,
 These dependency parsing schemata are versions of the homonymous schemata whose complete description can be found in CITATION, adapted for dependency parsing,,
 CITATION gives a more thorough explanation of these relations and schemata,,
 In this section, we show that the schemata for CITATION and CITATION are correct, and use this to prove the correctness of the schema for CITATION,,
