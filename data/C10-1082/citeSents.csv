1 Introduction Event recognition and classification has been pointed out to be very important to improve complex natural language processing (NLP) applications such as automatic summarization CITATION and question answering (QA) CITATION,,0
n the one hand, in topic detection and tracking CITATION, event is defined as an instance of a topic identified at document level describing something that happen (e.g., wars),,0
