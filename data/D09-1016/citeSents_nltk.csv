4 IE Evaluation 4.1 Data Sets We evaluated the performance of our IE system on two data sets: the MUC-4 terrorism corpus (Sund154 \x0cheim, 1992), and a ProMed disease outbreaks corpus (CITATION; CITATION).,,
As our first baseline, we used AutoSlog-TS CITATION, which is a weakly-supervised, pattern-based IE system available as part of the Sundance/AutoSlog software package CITATION.,,
Our previous work in event-based IE CITATION also used a pattern-based approach that applied semantic affinity patterns to relevant regions in text.,,
For example, most readers would agree that sentence (1) below is describing a terrorist event, while sen6 A similar strategy was used in previous work CITATION to generate a test set for the evaluation of a relevant region classifier.,,
