The two components of the unified model presented in this paper are somewhat similar to our previous work CITATION, where we employ a relevant region identification phase prior to pattern-based extraction,,
The syntactic and semantic features are generated by the Sundance/AutoSlog system CITATION,,
The AutoSlog pattern generator CITATION is used to create the lexico-syntactic pattern features that capture local context around each noun phrase,,
The named-entity features are generated by the freely available Stanford NER tagger CITATION,,
CITATION and CITATION incorporate global information by enforcing event role or label consistency over a document or across related documents,,
Similarly, classifierbased approaches (CITATION; CITATION; CITATION; CITATION) rely on features in the immediate context of the candidate extractions,,
CITATION use discourse trees and local syntactic dependencies in a pattern-based framework to incorporate wider context,,
