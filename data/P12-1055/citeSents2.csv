A representative work is that of CITATION, in which they systematically study the challenges of NER, compare several solutions, and show some interesting findings,,
Owing to the availability of annotated corpora, such as ACE05, Enron CITATION and CoNLL03 (Tjong Kim Sang and De Meulder, 2003), data driven methods are now dominant,,
Current studies of NER mainly focus on formal text such as news articles (CITATION; CITATION),,
2.1 NER NER has been well studied and its solutions can be divided into three categories: 1) Rule-based CITATION; 2) machine learning based (CITATION; CITATION); and 3) hybrid methods CITATION,,
