 Capitalization (4): We create four capitalization features to determine whether NPi IsAllCap, IsInitCap, IsCapPeriod, and IsAllLower (see CITATION),,
html 8 See CITATION and CITATION for a detailed introduction to factor graphs,,
 First, if NPi is an NE, we create a feature whose value is the NE label of NPi, as determined by the Stanford CRF-based NE recognizer CITATION,,

 For example, if two NPs are the same string in a given document, then it is more likely than not that they have the same semantic subtype according to the one sense per discourse hypothesis CITATION,,

 Exact inference using the sumproduct algorithm CITATION is possible if there are no cycles in the graph; otherwise a belief propagation algorithm, such as loopy belief propagation CITATION, can be applied,,
