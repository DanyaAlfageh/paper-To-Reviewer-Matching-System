6 Details of how these lists are constructed can be found in CITATION,,
Grammatical (2): We create a feature that encodes the part-of-speech (POS) sequence of NPi obtained via the Stanford POS tagger CITATION,,
First, if NPi is an NE, we create a feature whose value is the NE label of NPi, as determined by the Stanford CRF-based NE recognizer CITATION,,
These 92 semantic subtypes have been used to manually annotate the NPs in the BBN Entity Type Corpus CITATION,,
For example, if two NPs are the same string in a given document, then it is more likely than not that they have the same semantic subtype according to the one sense per discourse hypothesis CITATION,,
In recent years, supervised semantic class determination has been tackled primarily in the context of (1) coreference resolution (e.g., CITATION, CITATION), where semantic classes are induced and subsequently used to disallow coreference between semantically incompatible NPs, and (2) the mention detection task in the ACE evaluations (e.g., CITATION; 2006)), where the goal is to identify the boundary of a mention (i.e., a noun phrase that belongs to one of the pre-defined ACE semantic classes), its mention type (e.g., pronoun, name), and its semantic class,,
A detailed description of these supertypes and subtypes can be found in CITATION,,
Capitalization (4): We create four capitalization features to determine whether NPi IsAllCap, IsInitCap, IsCapPeriod, and IsAllLower (see CITATION),,
In this section, we first give a brief overview of factor graphs8, and show how they can be used to perform joint 7 We use the MaxEnt implementation available at http://homepages.inf.ed.ac.uk/s0450736/maxent toolkit.html 8 See CITATION and CITATION for a detailed introduction to factor graphs,,
a feature whose value is the concatenation of the head of NPi and its WordNet sense number.2 2 We employ the sense number that is manually annotated for each NP in the WSJ corpus as part of the OntoNotes project CITATION,,
Exact inference using the sumproduct algorithm CITATION is possible if there are no cycles in the graph; otherwise a belief propagation algorithm, such as loopy belief propagation CITATION, can be applied,,
