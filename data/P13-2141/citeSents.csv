This is different from OpenIE (CITATION; CITATION) which needs to discover new relations,,
Given large amounts of labeled sentences, supervised methods are able to achieve good performance (CITATION; CITATION),,
Recently an approach called distant supervision (DS) CITATION was proposed, which does not require any labels on the text,,

We used Open NLP POS tagger, Standford NER CITATION and MaltParser CITATION to label/tag sentences,,
(DS) CITATION was proposed, which does not require any labels on the text,,
Some variants have been proposed to improve the performance (CITATION; CITATION; CITATION),,
CITATION design a generative model to identify noise patterns,,
The previous works (CITATION; CITATION; CITATION) do not distinguish the two types of noise but directly infer the overall noise from the data,,
We notice that when CITATION studied a fine-grained NER method, they applied the method to relation extraction by adding the recognized entity tags to the features,,
In Figure 1, we compared our method with two previous methods: MultiR CITATION and CITATION (Taka),,
Following CITATION, we selected the top 50 ranked (according to their classification probabilities) relation facts of the 15 largest relations,,
We compared our results with those of CITATION and we achieved greater average pre,,

ETD is also better than adding the entity types of the pair to the feature vector (DS Figer)2 as in CITATION,,

3.3 Feature Space Partition and Ensemble The features of DS CITATION are very sparse in the corpus,,
We add some features in CITATION: Trigger Words (the words on the dependency path except stop words) and Entity String (source entity and destination entity),,
We also notice that CITATIONa) and CITATIONb) utilize external information such as more facts from Yago and labeled sentences from ACE to improve the 810 \x0cperformance,,
