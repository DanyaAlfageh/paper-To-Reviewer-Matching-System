The perceptron has been used in previous work on dependency parsing by CITATION, with a parser based on Eisners algorithm CITATION, and also on incremental constituent parsing (Collins & Roark, 2006),,
The choice is motivated by the simplicity and performance of perceptrons, which have proved competitive on a number of tasks; e.g., in shallow parsing, where perceptrons performance is comparable to that of Conditional Random Field models CITATION,,
Also the MST parser of McDonald uses a variant of the perceptron algorithm CITATION,,
We learn the parameters from the training data with the perceptron CITATION, in the online multiclass formulation of the algorithm CITATION with uniform negative updates,,
