corpus that is described in CITATION,,
The first approach to identifying negations in Swedish clinical text was carried out by CITATION, by whom the well-known NegEx algorithm CITATION, created for English clinical text, was adapted to Swedish clinical text,,
However, as CITATION point out, it cannot be said that there is a fixed level of agreement that is valid for all purposes of a corpus, but the agreement must be high enough for a certain purpose,,
The English version of NegEx CITATION obtained a precision of 84.5 percent and a recall of 82.0 percent,,
Where the best results for English with Stanford NER CRF gave a precision of 86.1 percent, a recall of 86.5 percent and F-score of 86.3 percent, for German the best results had a precision of 80.4 percent, a recall of 65.0 percent and an F-score of 71.9 percent, CITATION,,
5 \x0cAnother example of negation detection in English is the approach used by CITATION,,
4 Results of training with Stanford NER CRF As a first indication of whether it is possible to use the annotated consensus corpus for finding negation and speculation in clinical text, we trained the Stanford NER CRF, CITATION on the annotated data,,
2.2 The BioScope Corpus Annotated clinical corpora in English for negation and speculation are described in CITATION, where clinical radiology reports (a subset of the so called BioScope Corpus) encompassing 6 383 sentences were annotated for negation, speculation and scope,,
In CITATION, they used clinical narrative reports containing 1 766 instances annotated for negation,,
lts of the evaluation using ten-fold cross validation CITATION are shown in Table 3 and Table 4,,
CITATION describe a machine learning system detecting the scope of negations, which is based on meta-learning and is trained and tested on the annotated BioScope Corpus,,
ine learning algorithm Conditional Random Fields CITATION and has been used extensively for identifying named entities in news text,,
Among other suggestions for improving the annotation guidelines for the corpus that the consensus is based on, CITATION suggests that the guidelines should also include instructions on the focus of the uncertainties, that is, what concepts are to be annotated for uncertainty,,
2.4 The annotated Swedish clinical corpus for negation and speculation A process to create an annotated clinical corpus for negation and speculation is described in CITATION,,
A similar approach is used in CITATION, where they study emotion in speech,,
This division into two training sets follows the method used by CITATION, where sentences containing a cue are first detected, and then, among these sentences, the scope of the cue is determined,,
CITATION describes a trial to automatically identify speculative sentences in radiology reports, using Maximum Entropy Models,,
CITATION write that the fact that annotated data can be generalized and learnt by a machine learning system is not an indication that the annotations capture some kind of reality,,
This approach has, for example, achieved a very high inter-annotator agreement in the annotation of the evaluation data used by CITATION,,
3 Method for constructing the consensus We constructed a consensus annotation out of the three different annotations of the same clinical corpus that is described in CITATION,,
Other options would be to let the annotators discuss the sentences that were not identically annotated, or to use the method of the BioScope Corpus, where the sentences that were not identically annotated were resolved by a chief annotator CITATION,,
The results of the evaluation using ten-fold cross validation CITATION are shown in Table 3 and Table 4,,
2.3 The Stanford NER based on CRF The Stanford Named Entity Recognizer (NER) is based on the machine learning algorithm Conditional Random Fields CITATION and has been used extensively for identifying named entities in news text,,
 and CITATION ,,
(2005) used the terms in SNOMEDCT (Systematized Nomenclature of MedicineClinical Terms), CITATION and matched them to 14 792 concepts in 41 health records,,
As described in CITATION, the annotation guidelines were inspired by the BioScope Corpus guideli,,
This division into two training sets follows the method used by CITATION, where sentences containing a cue are f,,
This is supported by the findings of CITATION, who writes that cues for speculation are domain-specific,,
