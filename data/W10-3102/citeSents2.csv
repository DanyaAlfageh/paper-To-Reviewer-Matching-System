4 Results of training with Stanford NER CRF As a first indication of whether it is possible to use the annotated consensus corpus for finding negation and speculation in clinical text, we trained the Stanford NER CRF, CITATION on the annotated data,,
CITATION write that the fact that annotated data can be generalized and learnt by a machine learning system is not an indication that the annotations capture some kind of reality,,
Where the best results for English with Stanford NER CRF gave a precision of 86.1 percent, a recall of 86.5 percent and F-score of 86.3 percent, for German the best results had a precision of 80.4 percent, a recall of 65.0 percent and an F-score of 71.9 percent, CITATION,,
2.3 The Stanford NER based on CRF The Stanford Named Entity Recognizer (NER) is based on the machine learning algorithm Conditional Random Fields CITATION and has been used extensively for identifying named entities in news text,,
