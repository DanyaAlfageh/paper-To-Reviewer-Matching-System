 Following traditional approaches, we employ a linearchain CRF CITATION that operates over standard lexical, POS-based and syntactic features (Finkel et al,,
, 2005; CITATION; CITATION; CITATION),,
 For example, rule-based methods (CITATION; CITATION) identify generalizations both for single field fillers and for relations between fields and use them to fill event templates,,
 Likewise, classifier-based algorithms (CITATION; CITATION; CITATION; CITATION) generally train individual classifiers for each type of field and aggregate candidate fillers based on a sentential event classifier,,
 Finally, unsupervised techniques CITATION have combined clustering, semantic roles, and syntactic relations in order to both construct and fill event templates,,

 The sentences were POS tagged with the MXPOST tagger CITATION and parsed with the Charniak parser CITATION,,
 Then, we trained the parameters of the global potentials using the structured perceptron algorithm CITATION on the development data,,
 There has also been unsupervised work that demonstrates the benefit of domain-specific constraints CITATION,,

 Evaluation Measures We follow the MUC-4 scoring guidelines CITATION,,

 Following traditional approaches, we employ a linearchain CRF CITATION that operates over standard lexical, POS-based and syntactic features (Finkel et al,,

 This potential is inspired by the one sense per discourse constraint CITATION that associates all the occurrences of the word in a document with the same semantic meaning,,
 The final label assignment is determined by a majority vote between the potentials in the 10 iterations with the highest total inter potential agreement CITATION,,
 The first baseline is related to previous techniques that decompose the task into field extraction and event segmentation sub-tasks (CITATION; CITATION; CITATION),,
 An alternative approach is to encode this information as local features that reflect global dependencies CITATION,,
 In order to avoid this computational bottleneck we turn to dual-decomposition (CITATION; CITATION), an inference technique that enables efficient computation of a tight upper bound on the MAP objective, while preserving the original dependencies of the model,,
 Dual decomposition has been recently applied to a joint model for biomedical entity and event extraction by CITATION,,
 We solve this problem efficiently (O(n3)) using the Kuhn-Munkres algorithm CITATION,,
 For every document, we then map the learned events to the gold events in a greedy 1-1 manner using the Kuhn-Munkres algorithm CITATION,,
