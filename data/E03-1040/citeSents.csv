 The partial (or chunking) parser of CITATION, called SCOL, allows us to extract subjects and direct objects with reasonable confidence, and to extract potential prepositional phrases associated with the verb,,
 We use TGrep2 CITATION to identify potential indirect objects by assuming that an object followed by a noun phrase which SCOL has left unattached is a double-object frame,,
 Because verbs play a central role in the syntactic and semantic interpretation of a sentence, much research has focused on automatically learning properties of verbs from text corpora, such as their subcategorization (CITATION; CITATION), argument roles (CITATION; CITATION), selectional preferences CITATION, and lexical semantic classification (CITATION; CITATION; Schulte im CITATION; CITATION),,
 Specifically, CITATION showed that verbs could be automatically classified into one of three lexical semantic classes on the basis of five simple statistical features,,

 Specifically, CITATION showed that verbs could be automatically classified into one of three lexical semantic classes on the basis of five simple statistical features,,
 Furthermore, rather than using a class-by-class analysis as in CITATION, our features are determined through an analysis of the possible alternations for verbs independent of their class assignment, leading to a more general set of features,,
 Indeed, McCarthy CITATION confirmed this relation, showing includes a broad range of indicators of syntactic behaviours,,

 We focus on lexical semantic classes as in CITATION (hereafter Levin), which group together verbs sharing both a common semantics (such as manner of motion or change of state), and a set of syntactic alternations,,
 In CITATION (hereafter MS01), the differences between the specific semantic arguments and their possible alternations for the three target classes were analyzed to determine a small set of discriminating features,,
 The constraints on mapping semantic arguments to syntactic positions reflect underlying semantic properties of the verbs (CITATION; CITATION),,
1 Features over Syntactic Slots Syntactic alternations play a central role in defining classes, but are difficult to detect automatically from a corpus CITATION,,
 Earlier work has used a measure of overlap over nouns in syntactic slots as a noisy indicator of participation in an alternation (CITATION; CITATION),,

 1 The generality of our feature space enables experiments on a wider range of classes than has previously been attempted with the approach in MS01 and subsequent extensions CITATION,,
 Interestingly, CITATION showed that some of the hand-crafted features of MS01 were useful in Italian for classifying the same verb classes in that language,,
 While our method used supervised learning, CITATION found little difference in performance between unsupervised and supervised approaches on the original MS01 task,,
 Also using unsupervised learning, CITATION clustered Japanese verbs automatically into hundreds of semantic classes, which they then combined into a network of 38 classes using linguistic knowledge and semi-automated processing,,
