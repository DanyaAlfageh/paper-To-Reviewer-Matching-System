In this way, they are similar to what others have termed `go-back\' signals CITATION,,
While this strategy is often suboptimal in correcting ASR errors CITATION, REPs (45% error) and OMITs (52% error) were better recognized than ADDs (90% error) and PARs (72% error),,
Elsewhere CITATION, we have shown that chain position has an inuence on correction behaviour in the sense that more distant corrections tend to be misrecognized more often than corrections closer to the original error,,
That corrections are di\x0ecult for ASR systems is generally explained by the fact that they tend to be hyperarticulated |higher, louder, longer ...than other turns (CITATION; CITATION; CITATION; CITATION; CITATION), where ASR models are not well adapted to handle this special speaking style,,
This at the same time shows that a simpleno-detector will not be su\x0ecient as an indicator of aware sites (see also (CITATION; Krahmer et al., to appear)), given that most aware sites are more complex than that, such as turns 1159 and 1160 in the example of Figure 4,,
Given that, in current systems, both corrections and restarts often lead to recognition error CITATION, aware sites may be useful in preparing systems to deal with such problems,,
In terms of distinguishing features which might explain or help to identify these turns, we have previously examined the acoustic and prosodic features of aware sites CITATION,,
\x0cOne of our major \x0cndings is that prosody, which had already been shown to be a good predictor of misrecognitions (CITATION; CITATION), is also useful to correctly classify corrections and aware sites,,
We have previously discussed the prosodic and acoustic di\x0berences between corrections and non-correction (CITATION; CITATION),,
In addition to the descriptive study presented in this paper, we have also tried to automatically predict corrections and aware sites using the machine learning program RIPPER CITATION,,
It is implemented using an IVR (interactive voice response) platform developed at AT&T, combining ASR and textto-speech with a phone interface CITATION,,
These experiments show that corrections and aware sites can be classi\x0ced as such automatically, with a considerable degree of accuracy (CITATION; CITATION),,
TOOT was collected to study variations in dialogue strategy and in user-adapted interaction CITATION,,
Note that the utterance on the last line of this \x0cgure is labeled 2+PAR, given that this turn consist of two speech acts: the goal of the no-part of this 1 The labels discussed in this section for corrections and aware sites may well be related to more general dialogue acts, like the ones proposed by CITATION, but this needs to be explored in more detail in the future,,
In other papers (CITATION; CITATION; CITATION), we have already given some descriptive statistics on corrections and aware sites and we have been looking at methods to automatically predict these two utterance categories,,
