These experiments show that corrections and aware sites can be classi\x0ced as such automatically, with a considerable degree of accuracy (CITATION; CITATION),,
In terms of distinguishing features which might explain or help to identify these turns, we have previously examined the acoustic and prosodic features of aware sites CITATION,,
In this way, they are similar to what others have termed `go-back\' signals CITATION,,
That corrections are di\x0ecult for ASR systems is generally explained by the fact that they tend to be hyperarticulated |higher, louder, longer ...than other turns (CITATION; CITATION; CITATION; CITATION; CITATION), where ASR models are not well adapted to handle this special speaking style,,
\x0cOne of our major \x0cndings is that prosody, which had already been shown to be a good predictor of misrecognitions (CITATION; CITATION), is also useful to correctly classify corrections and aware sites,,
In other papers (CITATION; CITATION; CITATION), we have already given some descriptive statistics on corrections and aware sites and we have been looking at methods to automatically predict these two utterance categories,,
In addition to the descriptive study presented in this paper, we have also tried to automatically predict corrections and aware sites using the machine learning program RIPPER CITATION,,
