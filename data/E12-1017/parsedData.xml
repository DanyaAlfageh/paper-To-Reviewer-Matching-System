We consider the problem of NER in Arabic
Wikipedia, a semisupervised domain adap-
tation setting for which we have no labeled
training data in the target domain. To fa-
cilitate evaluation, we obtain annotations
for articles in four topical groups, allow-
ing annotators to identify domain-specific
entity types in addition to standard cate-
gories. Standard supervised learning on
newswire text leads to poor target-domain
recall. We train a sequence model and show
that a simple modification to the online
learnera loss function encouraging it to
arrogantly favor recall over precision
substantially improves recall and F1. We
then adapt our model with self-training
on unlabeled target-domain data; enforc-
ing the same recall-oriented bias in the self-
training stage yields marginal gains.1

This paper considers named entity recognition
(NER) in text that is different from most past re-
search on NER. Specifically, we consider Arabic
Wikipedia articles with diverse topics beyond the
commonly-used news domain. These data chal-
lenge past approaches in two ways:
First, Arabic is a morphologically rich lan-
guage (Habash, 2010). Named entities are ref-
erenced using complex syntactic constructions
(cf. English NEs, which are primarily sequences
of proper nouns). The Arabic script suppresses
most vowels, increasing lexical ambiguity, and
lacks capitalization, a key clue for English NER.
Second, much research has focused on the use
of news text for system building and evaluation.
Wikipedia articles are not news, belonging instead
to a wide range of domains that are not clearly

delineated. One hallmark of this divergence be-
tween Wikipedia and the news domain is a dif-
ference in the distributions of named entities. In-
deed, the classic named entity types (person, or-
ganization, location) may not be the most apt for
articles in other domains (e.g., scientific or social
topics). On the other hand, Wikipedia is a large
dataset, inviting semisupervised approaches.
In this paper, we describe advances on the prob-
lem of NER in Arabic Wikipedia. The techniques
are general and make use of well-understood
building blocks. Our contributions are:
A small corpus of articles annotated in a new
scheme that provides more freedom for annota-
tors to adapt NE analysis to new domains;
An arrogant learning approach designed to
boost recall in supervised training as well as
self-training; and
An empirical evaluation of this technique as ap-
plied to a well-established discriminative NER
model and feature set.
Experiments show consistent gains on the chal-
lenging problem of identifying named entities in
Arabic Wikipedia text.

Most of the effort in NER has been fo-
cused around a small set of domains and
general-purpose entity classes relevant to those
domainsespecially the categories PER(SON),
ORG(ANIZATION), and LOC(ATION) (POL),
which are highly prominent in news text. Ara-
bic is no exception: the publicly available NER
corporaACE (Walker et al., 2006), ANER (Be-
najiba et al., 2008), and OntoNotes (Hovy et al.,
2006)all are in the news domain.2 However,

appropriate entity classes will vary widely by do-
main; occurrence rates for entity classes are quite
different in news text vs. Wikipedia, for instance
(Balasuriya et al., 2009). This is abundantly
clear in technical and scientific discourse, where
much of the terminology is domain-specific, but it
holds elsewhere. Non-POL entities in the history
domain, for instance, include important events
(wars, famines) and cultural movements (roman-
ticism). Ignoring such domain-critical entities
likely limits the usefulness of the NE analysis.
Recognizing this limitation, some work on
NER has sought to codify more robust invento-
ries of general-purpose entity types (Sekine et al.,
2002; Weischedel and Brunstein, 2005; Grouin
et al., 2011) or to enumerate domain-specific
types (Settles, 2004; Yao et al., 2003). Coarse,
general-purpose categories have also been used
for semantic tagging of nouns and verbs (Cia-
ramita and Johnson, 2003). Yet as the number
of classes or domains grows, rigorously docu-
menting and organizing the classeseven for a
single languagerequires intensive effort. Ide-
ally, an NER system would refine the traditional
classes (Hovy et al., 2011) or identify new entity
classes when they arise in new domains, adapting
to new data. For this reason, we believe it is valu-
able to consider NER systems that identify (but
do not necessarily label) entity mentions, and also
to consider annotation schemes that allow annota-
tors more freedom in defining entity classes.
Our aim in creating an annotated dataset is to
provide a testbed for evaluation of new NER mod-
els. We will use these data as development and
sible NEs (Sekine et al., 2002). Nezda et al. (2006) anno-
tated and evaluated an Arabic NE corpus with an extended
set of 18 classes (including temporal and numeric entities);

2.1 Annotation Strategy
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999546037037037">
We conducted a small annotation project on Ara-
bic Wikipedia articles. Two college-educated na-
tive Arabic speakers annotated about 3,000 sen-
tences from 31 articles. We identified four top-
ical areas of interesthistory, technology, sci-
ence, and sportsand browsed these topics un-
til we had found 31 articles that we deemed sat-
isfactory on the basis of length (at least 1,000
words), cross-lingual linkages (associated articles
in English, German, and Chinese3), and subjec-
tive judgments of quality. The list of these arti-
cles along with sample NEs are presented in ta-
ble 1. These articles were then preprocessed to
extract main article text (eliminating tables, lists,
info-boxes, captions, etc.) for annotation.
Our approach follows ACE guidelines (LDC,
2005) in identifying NE boundaries and choos-
ing POL tags. In addition to this traditional form
of annotation, annotators were encouraged to ar-
ticulate one to three salient, article-specific en-
tity categories per article. For example, names
of particles (e.g., proton) are highly salient in the
Atom article. Annotators were asked to read the
entire article first, and then to decide which non-
traditional classes of entities would be important
in the context of article. In some cases, annotators
reported using heuristics (such as being proper

classes. Annotators produced written descriptions
of their classes, including example instances.
This scheme was chosen for its flexibility: in
contrast to a scenario with a fixed ontology, anno-
tators required minimal training beyond the POL
conventions, and did not have to worry about
delineating custom categories precisely enough
that they would extend straightforwardly to other
topics or domains. Of course, we expect inter-
annotator variability to be greater for these open-
ended classification criteria.

level agreement measures and entity-level F1 be-

These measures indicate strong agreement for
locating and categorizing NEs both at the token
and chunk levels. Closer examination of agree-
ment scores shows that PER and MIS classes have
the lowest rates of agreement. That the mis-
cellaneous class, used for infrequent or article-
specific NEs, receives poor agreement is unsur-
prising. The low agreement on the PER class
seems to be due to the use of titles and descriptive
terms in personal names. Despite explicit guide-
lines to exclude the titles, annotators disagreed on
the inclusion of descriptors that disambiguate the

2.3 Validating Category Intuitions
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999118333333334">
To investigate the variability between annotators
with respect to custom category intuitions, we
asked our two annotators to independently read
10 of the articles in the data (scattered across our
four focus domains) and suggest up to 3 custom
categories for each. We assigned short names to
these suggestions, seen in table 3. In 13 cases,
both annotators suggested a category for an article
that was essentially the same (); three such cat-
egories spanned multiple articles. In three cases
a category was suggested by only one annotator
().5 Thus, we see that our annotators were gen-
erally, but not entirely, consistent with each other
in their creation of custom categories. Further, al-
most all of our article-specific categories corre-
spond to classes in the extended NE taxonomy of
(Sekine et al., 2002), which speaks to the reason-
ableness of both sets of categoriesand by exten-
sion, our open-ended annotation process.
Our annotation of named entities outside of the
traditional POL classes creates a useful resource
for entity detection and recognition in new do-
mains. Even the ability to detect non-canonical
types of NEs should help applications such as QA
and MT (Toral et al., 2005; Babych and Hart-
ley, 2003). Possible avenues for future work
include annotating and projecting non-canonical

tering non-canonical types of entities into article-
specific or cross-article classes (cf. Frietag, 2004),
or using non-canonical classes to improve the
(author-specified) article categories in Wikipedia.
Hereafter, we merge all article-specific cate-
gories with the generic MIS category. The pro-
portion of entity mentions that are tagged as MIS,
while varying to a large extent by document, is
a major indication of the gulf between the news
data (&lt;10%) and the Wikipedia data (53% for the
development set, 37% for the test set).
Below, we aim to develop entity detection mod-
els that generalize beyond the traditional POL en-
tities. We do not address here the challenges of
automatically classifying entities or inferring non-

Wikipedia.10 A descriptive list of our features is

We use a first-order structured perceptron; none

the constraint that NE sequences must begin with
B (so the bigram hO, Ii is disallowed).
Training this model on ACE and ANER data

with a cost function term, we can incorporate a
task-dependent notion of error into the objective,
as with structured SVMs (Taskar et al., 2004;

a measure of error when y is the correct label se-

In this framework, cost functions can be for-
mulated to distinguish between different types of
errors made during training. For a tag sequence
y = hy1, y2, . . . , yM i, Gimpel and Smith (2010b)
define word-local cost functions that differently
penalize precision errors (i.e., yi = O yi 6= O
for the ith word), recall errors (yi 6= O yi = O),
and entity class/position errors (other cases where
yi 6= yi). As will be shown below, a key problem
in cross-domain NER is poor recall, so we will
penalize recall errors more severely:

the recall-oriented perceptron (ROP).
We note that Minkov et al. (2006) similarly ex-
plored the recall vs. precision tradeoff in NER.
Their technique was to directly tune the weight
of a single featurethe feature marking O (non-
entity tokens); a lower weight for this feature will
incur a greater penalty for predicting O. Below
we demonstrate that our method, which is less
coarse, is more successful in our setting.12
In our experiments we will show that injecting
arrogance into the learner via the recall-oriented
loss function substantially improves recall, espe-
cially for non-POL entities (5.3).

(Clark et al., 2003; Mihalcea, 2004; McClosky

original labeled set, and relabeling the target data;
see Algorithm 1. Before self-training, we remove
sentences hypothesized not to contain any named
entity mentions, which we found avoids further
encouragement of the model toward low recall.

5 Experiments

<bodyText confidence="0.982856714285714">
We investigate two questions in the context of
NER for Arabic Wikipedia:
Loss function: Does integrating a cost func-
tion into our learning algorithm, as we have
done in the recall-oriented perceptron (4.1),
improve recall and overall performance on
Wikipedia data?
Semisupervised learning for domain adap-
tation: Can our models benefit from large
amounts of unlabeled Wikipedia data, in addi-
tion to the (out-of-domain) labeled data? We
experiment with a self-training phase following
the fully supervised learning phase.
We report experiments for the possible combi-
nations of the above ideas. These are summarized
in table 5. Note that the recall-oriented percep-
tron can be used for the supervised learning phase,
for the self-training phase, or both. This leaves us
with the following combinations:
reg/none (baseline): regular supervised learner.
ROP/none: recall-oriented supervised learner.

self-training will follow); = 100 for recall-
oriented self-training following recall-oriented su-

recall-oriented self-training following regular super-
vised learning (reg/ROP).
reg/reg: standard self-training setup.
ROP/reg: recall-oriented supervised learner, fol-
lowed by standard self-training.
reg/ROP: regular supervised model as the initial la-
beler for recall-oriented self-training.
ROP/ROP (the double ROP condition): recall-
oriented supervised model as the initial labeler for
recall-oriented self-training. Note that the two
ROPs can use different cost parameters.
For evaluating our models we consider the
named entity detection task, i.e., recognizing
which spans of words constitute entities. This
is measured by per-entity precision, recall, and
F1.13 To measure statistical significance of differ-
ences between models we use Gimpel and Smiths
(2010) implementation of the paired bootstrap re-
sampler of (Koehn, 2004), taking 10,000 samples

Unsurprisingly, performance on Wikipedia data
varies widely across article domains and is much
lower than in-domain performance. Precision
scores fall between 60% and 72% for all domains,
but recall in most cases is far worse. Miscella-
neous class recall, in particular, suffers badly (un-
der 10%)which partially accounts for the poor
recall in science and technology articles (they
have by far the highest proportion of MIS entities).

Results are shown in table 5. We find that stan-
dard self-training (the middle column) has very

5.3 Recall-Oriented Learning
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.998451">
The recall-oriented bias can be introduced in ei-
ther or both of the stages of our semisupervised
learning framework: in the supervised learn-
ing phase, modifying the objective of our base-
line (5.1); and within the self-training algorithm
(5.2).18 As noted in 4.1, the aim of this ap-
proach is to discourage recall errors (false nega-
tives), which are the chief difficulty for the news
texttrained model in the new domain. We se-
lected the value of the false positive penalty for
cost-augmented decoding, , using the develop-
ment data (figure 1).
The results in table 5 demonstrate improve-

stages of learning.19 When used in the super-

In terms of F1, the worst of the 3 models with the ROP
supervised learner significantly outperforms the best model
with the regular supervised learner (p &lt; 0.005). The im-
vised phase (bottom left cell), the recall gains
are substantialnearly 9% over the baseline. In-
tegrating this bias within self-training (last col-
umn of the table) produces a more modest im-
provement (less than 3%) relative to the base-
line. In both cases, the improvements to recall
more than compensate for the amount of degra-
dation to precision. This trend is robust: wher-
ever the recall-oriented perceptron is added, we
observe improvements in both recall and F1. Per-
haps surprisingly, these gains are somewhat addi-
tive: using the ROP in both learning phases gives
a small (though not always significant) gain over
alternatives (standard supervised perceptron, no
self-training, or self-training with a standard per-
ceptron). In fact, when the standard supervised
learner is used, recall-oriented self-training suc-
ceeds despite the ineffectiveness of standard self-
training.
Performance breakdowns by (gold) class, fig-
ure 2, and domain, figure 3, further attest to the
robustness of the overall results. The most dra-
matic gains are in miscellaneous class recall
each form of the recall bias produces an improve-
ment, and using this bias in both the supervised
and self-training phases is clearly most success-
ful for miscellaneous entities. Correspondingly,
the technology and science domains (in which this
class dominates83% and 61% of mentions, ver-
provements due to self-training are marginal, however: ROP
self-training produces a significant gain only following reg-
ular supervised learning (p &lt; 0.05).

tively) receive the biggest boost. Still, the gaps
between domains are not entirely removed.
Most improvements relate to the reduction of
false negatives, which fall into three groups:
(a) entities occurring infrequently or partially
in the labeled training data (e.g. uranium);
(b) domain-specific entities sharing lexical or con-
textual features with the POL entities (e.g. Linux,
titanium); and (c) words with Latin characters,
common in the science and technology domains.
(a) and (b) are mostly transliterations into Arabic.
An alternativeand simplerapproach to
controlling the precision-recall tradeoff is the
Minkov et al. (2006) strategy of tuning a single
feature weight subsequent to learning (see 4.1
above). We performed an oracle experiment to
determine how this compares to recall-oriented
learning in our setting. An oracle trained with
the method of Minkov et al. outperforms the three
models in table 5 that use the regular perceptron
for the supervised phase of learning, but under-
performs the supervised ROP conditions.20
Overall, we find that incorporating the recall-
oriented bias in learning is fruitful for adapting to
Wikipedia because the gains in recall outpace the
damage to precision.

Tuning the O feature weight to optimize for F1 on our
test set, we found that oracle precision would be 66.2, recall
would be 39.0, and F1 would be 49.1. The F1 score of our
best model is nearly 3 points higher than the Minkov et al.
style oracle, and over 4 points higher than the non-oracle
version where the development set is used for tuning.
at regularization (Chelba and Acero, 2006) and
feature design (Daume III, 2007); we alter the
loss function. Not surprisingly, the double-ROP
approach harms performance on the original do-
main (on ACE data, we achieve 55.41% F1, far
below the standard perceptron). Yet we observe
that models can be prepared for adaptation even
before a learner is exposed a new domain, sacri-
ficing performance in the original domain.
The recall-oriented bias is not merely encour-
aging the learner to identify entities already seen
in training. As recall increases, so does the num-
ber of new entity types recovered by the model:
of the 2,070 NE types in the test data that were
never seen in training, only 450 were ever found
by the baseline, versus 588 in the reg/ROP condi-
tion, 632 in the ROP/none condition, and 717 in
the double-ROP condition.
We note finally that our method is a simple
extension to the standard structured perceptron;
cost-augmented inference is often no more ex-
pensive than traditional inference, and the algo-
rithmic change is equivalent to adding one addi-
tional feature. Our recall-oriented cost function
is parameterized by a single value, ; recall is
highly sensitive to the choice of this value (fig-
ure 1 shows how we tuned it on development
data), and thus we anticipate that, in general, such
tuning will be essential to leveraging the benefits
of arrogance.

Our approach draws on insights from work in
the areas of NER, domain adaptation, NLP with
Wikipedia, and semisupervised learning. As all
are broad areas of research, we highlight only the
most relevant contributions here.
Research in Arabic NER has been focused on
compiling and optimizing the gazetteers and fea-

\x0cture sets for standard sequential modeling algo-
rithms (Benajiba et al., 2008; Farber et al., 2008;
Shaalan and Raza, 2008; Abdul-Hamid and Dar-
wish, 2010). We make use of features identi-
fied in this prior work to construct a strong base-
line system. We are unaware of any Arabic NER
work that has addressed diverse text domains like
Wikipedia. Both the English and Arabic ver-
sions of Wikipedia have been used, however, as
resources in service of traditional NER (Kazama
and Torisawa, 2007; Benajiba et al., 2008). Attia
et al. (2010) heuristically induce a mapping be-
tween Arabic Wikipedia and Arabic WordNet to
construct Arabic NE gazetteers.
Balasuriya et al. (2009) highlight the substan-
tial divergence between entities appearing in En-
glish Wikipedia versus traditional corpora, and
the effects of this divergence on NER perfor-
mance. There is evidence that models trained
on Wikipedia data generalize and perform well
on corpora with narrower domains. Nothman
et al. (2009) and Balasuriya et al. (2009) show
that NER models trained on both automatically
and manually annotated Wikipedia corpora per-
form reasonably well on news corpora. The re-
verse scenario does not hold for models trained
on news text, a result we also observe in Arabic
NER. Other work has gone beyond the entity de-
tection problem: Florian et al. (2004) addition-
ally predict within-document entity coreference
for Arabic, Chinese, and English ACE text, while
Cucerzan (2007) aims to resolve every mention
detected in English Wikipedia pages to a canoni-
cal article devoted to the entity in question.
The domain and topic diversity of NEs has been
studied in the framework of domain adaptation
research. A group of these methods use self-
training and select the most informative features
and training instances to adapt a source domain
learner to the new target domain. Wu et al. (2009)
bootstrap the NER leaner with a subset of unla-
beled instances that bridge the source and target
domains. Jiang and Zhai (2006) and Daume III
(2007) make use of some labeled target-domain
data to tune or augment the features of the source
model towards the target domain. Here, in con-
trast, we use labeled target-domain data only for
tuning and evaluation. Another important dis-
tinction is that domain variation in this prior
work is restricted to topically-related corpora (e.g.
newswire vs. broadcast news), whereas in our
work, major topical differences distinguish the
training and test corporaand consequently, their
salient NE classes. In these respects our NER
setting is closer to that of Florian et al. (2010),
who recognize English entities in noisy text, (Sur-
deanu et al., 2011), which concerns information
extraction in a topically distinct target domain,
and (Dalton et al., 2011), which addresses English
NER in noisy and topically divergent text.
Self-training (Clark et al., 2003; Mihalcea,
2004; McClosky et al., 2006) is widely used
in NLP and has inspired related techniques that
learn from automatically labeled data (Liang et
al., 2008; Petrov et al., 2010). Our self-training
procedure differs from some others in that we use
all of the automatically labeled examples, rather
than filtering them based on a confidence score.
Cost functions have been used in non-
structured classification settings to penalize cer-
tain types of errors more than others (Chan and
Stolfo, 1998; Domingos, 1999; Kiddon and Brun,
2011). The goal of optimizing our structured NER
model for recall is quite similar to the scenario ex-
plored by Minkov et al. (2006), as noted above.

8 Conclusion
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.998395615384615">
We explored the problem of learning an NER
model suited to domains for which no labeled
training data are available. A loss function to en-
courage recall over precision during supervised
discriminative learning substantially improves re-
call and overall entity detection performance, es-
pecially when combined with a semisupervised
learning regimen incorporating the same bias.
We have also developed a small corpus of Ara-
bic Wikipedia articles via a flexible entity an-
notation scheme spanning four topical domains
(publicly available at http://www.ark.cs.

To facilitate evaluation, we obtain annotations for articles in four topical groups, allowing annotators to identify domain-specific entity types in addition to standard categories. Standard supervised learning on newswire text leads to poor target-domain recall. We train a sequence model and show that a simple modification to the online learnera loss function encouraging it to arrogantly favor recall over precision substantially improves recall and F1.

Our annotation of named entities outside of the traditional POL classes creates a useful resource for entity detection and recognition in new domains. Even the ability to detect non-canonical types of NEs should help applications such as QA and MT (Toral et al., 2005; Babych and Hartley, 2003).

This is abundantly clear in technical and scientific discourse, where much of the terminology is domain-specific, but it holds elsewhere. Non-POL entities in the history domain, for instance, include important events (wars, famines) and cultural movements (romanticism). Ignoring such domain-critical entities likely limits the usefulness of the NE analysis. Recognizing this limitation, some work on NER has sought to codify more robust inventories of general-purpose entity types (Sekine et al., 2002; Weischedel and Brunstein, 2005; Grouin et al., 2011) or to enumerate domain-specific types (Se</context>

There is evidence that models trained on Wikipedia data generalize and perform well on corpora with narrower domains. Nothman et al. (2009) and Balasuriya et al.

Self-training (Clark et al., 2003; Mihalcea, 2004; McClosky et al., 2006) is widely used in NLP and has inspired related techniques that learn from automatically labeled data (Liang et al., 2008; Petrov et al., 2010). Our self-training procedure differs from some others in that we use all of the automatically labeled examples, rather than filtering them based on a confidence score. Cost functions have been used in nonstructured classification settings to penalize certain types of errors more than others (Chan and Stolfo, 1998; Domingos, 1999; Kiddon and Brun, 2011). The goal of optimizing our structured NER model for recall is quite similar to the scenario explored by Minkov et al. (2006), as noted above. 8 Conclusion We explored the problem of learning an NER model suited to domains for which no labeled training data are available. A loss function to encourage recall over precision during supervised discriminative learning substantially improves recall and overall entity detection performance, especially when combined with a semisupervised learning regimen incorporating the same bias.

Not surprisingly, the double-ROP approach harms performance on the original domain (on ACE data, we achieve 55.41% F1, far below the standard perceptron). Yet we observe that models can be prepared for adaptation even before a learner is exposed a new domain, sacrificing performance in the original domain. The recall-oriented bias is not merely encouraging the learner to identify entities already seen in training. As recall increases, so does the number of new entity types recovered by the model: of the 2,070 NE types in the te</context>

Non-POL entities in the history domain, for instance, include important events (wars, famines) and cultural movements (romanticism). Ignoring such domain-critical entities likely limits the usefulness of the NE analysis. Recognizing this limitation, some work on NER has sought to codify more robust inventories of general-purpose entity types (Sekine et al., 2002; Weischedel and Brunstein, 2005; Grouin et al., 2011) or to enumerate domain-specific types (Settles, 2004; Yao et al., 2003). Coarse, general-purpose categories have also been used for semantic tagging of nouns and verbs (Ciaramita and Johnson, 2003). Yet as the number of classes or domains grows, rigorously documenting and organizing the classeseven for a single languagerequires intensive effort. Ideally, an NER system would refine the traditional classes (Hovy et al., 2011) or identify new entity classes when they arise in new domains, adapting to new data. For this reason, we believe it is valuable to consider NER systems that identify (but do not necessarily label) entity mentions, and also to consider annotation schemes that allow annotators more freedom in defining entity classes.

Yet the available unlabeled data is vast, so we turn to semisupervised learning. Here we adapt self-training, a simple technique that leverages a supervised learner (like the perceptron) to perform semisupervised learning (Clark et al., 2003; Mihalcea, 2004; McClosky et al., 2006). In our version, a model is trained on the labeled data, then used to label the unlabeled target data. We iterate between training on the hypothetically-labeled target data plus the original labeled set, and relabeling the target data; see Algorithm 1. Before self-training, we remove sentences hypothesized not to contain any named entity mentions, which we found avoids further encouragement of the model toward low recall. 5 Experiments We investigate two questions in the context of NER for Arabic Wikipedia: Loss function: Does integrating a cost functio</context>

Precision scores fall between 60% and 72% for all domains, but recall in most cases is far worse.

Our unlabeled data consists of 397 Arabic Wikipedia articles (1 million words) selected at random from all articles exceeding a simple length threshold (1,000 words); see table 4.

There is evidence that models trained on Wikipedia data generalize and perform well on corpora with narrower domains. Nothman et al. (2009) and Balasuriya et al. (2009) show that NER models trained on both automatically and manually annotated Wikipedia corpora perform reasonably well on news corpora. The reverse scenario does not hold for models trained on news text, a result we also observe in Arabic NER. Other work has gone beyond the entity detection problem: Florian et al. (2004) additionally predict within-document entity coreference for Arabic, Chinese, and English ACE text, while Cucerzan (2007) aims to resolve every mention detected in English Wikipedia pages to a canonical article devoted to the entity in question. The domain and topic diversity of NEs has been studied in the framework of domain adaptation research. A group of these methods use selftraining and select the most informative features and training instances to adapt a source domain learner to the new target domain. Wu et al.

As will be shown below, a key problem in cross-domain NER is poor recall, so we will penalize recall errors more severely: c(y, y0 ) = M X i=1 0 if yi = y0 i if yi 6= O y0 i = O 1 otherwise (3) for a penalty parameter &gt; 1. We call our learner the recall-oriented perceptron (ROP). We note that Minkov et al. (2006) similarly explored the recall vs. precision tradeoff in NER. Their tec</context>

This is abundantly clear in technical and scientific discourse, where much of the terminology is domain-specific, but it holds elsewhere. Non-POL entities in the history domain, for instance, include important events (wars, famines) and cultural movements (romanticism). Ignoring such domain-critical entities likely limits the usefulness of the NE analysis. Recognizing this limitation, some work on NER has sought to codify more robust inventories of general-purpose entity types (Sekine et al., 2002; Weischedel and Brunstein, 2005; Grouin et al., 2011) or to enumerate domain-specific types (Settles, 2004; Yao et al., 2003).

We then adapt our model with self-training on unlabeled target-domain data; enforcing the same recall-oriented bias in the selftraining stage yields marginal gains.1 1 Introduction This paper considers named entity recognition (NER) in text that is different from most past research on NER. Specifically, we consider Arabic Wikipedia articles with diverse topics beyond the commonly-used news domain. These data challenge past approaches in two ways: First, Arabic is a morphologically rich language (Habash, 2010). Named entities are referenced using complex syntactic constructions (cf. English NEs, which are primarily sequences of proper nouns). The Arabic script suppresses most vowels, increasing lexical ambiguity, and lacks capitalization, a key clue for English NER. Second, much research has focused on the use of news text for system building and evaluation. Wikipedia articles are not news, belonging instead to a wide range of domains that are not clearly 1 The annotated dataset and a supplementary document with additional details of this work can be found at: http://www.ark.cs.cmu.edu/AQMAR deline</context>

Our annotation of named entities outside of the traditional POL classes creates a useful resource for entity detection and recognition in new domains. Even the ability to detect non-canonical types of NEs should help applications such as QA and MT (Toral et al., 2005; Babych and Hartley, 2003). Possible avenues for future work include annotating and projecting non-canonical 5 When it came to tagging NEs, one of the two annotators was assigned to each article.

Frietag, 2004), or using non-canonical classes to improve the (author-specified) article categories in Wikipedia. Hereafter, we merge all article-specific categories with the generic MIS category. The proportion of entity mentions that are tagged as MIS, while varying to a large extent by document, is a major indication of the gulf between the news data (&lt;10%) and the Wikipedia data (53% for the development set, 37% for the test set).

The domain and topic diversity of NEs has been studied in the framework of domain adaptation research. A group of these methods use selftraining and select the most informative features and training instances to adapt a source domain learner to the new target domain. Wu et al.

Jiang and Zhai (2006) and Daume III (2007) make use of some labeled target-domain data to tune or augment the features of the source model towards the target domain. Here, in contrast, we use labeled target-domain data only for tuning and evaluation. Another important distinction is that domain variation in this prior work is restricted to topically-related corpora (e.g. newswire vs. broadcast news), whereas in our work, major topical differences distinguish the training and test corporaand consequently, their salient NE classes.

For a tag sequence y = hy1, y2, . . . , yM i, Gimpel and Smith (2010b) define word-local cost functions that differently penalize precision errors (i.e., yi = O yi 6= O for the ith word), recall errors (yi 6= O yi = O), and entity class/position errors (other cases where yi 6= yi). As will be shown below, a key problem in cross-domain NER is poor recall, so we will penalize recall errors more severely: c(y, y0 ) = M X i=1 0 if yi = y0 i if yi 6= O y0 i = O 1 otherwise (3) for a penalty parameter &gt; 1. We call our learner the recall-oriented perceptron (ROP). We note that Minkov et al. (2006) similarly explored the recall vs. precision tradeoff in NER. Their technique was to directly tune the weight of a single featurethe feature marking O (nonentity tokens); a lower weight for this feature will incur a greater penalty for predicting O. Below we demonstrate that our method, which is less coarse, is more successful in our setting.12 In our experiments we will show that injecting arrogance into the learner via the recall-oriented loss function substantially improves recall, especially for non-POL entities (5.3). 4.2 Self-Training and Semisupervised Learning As we will show experimen</context>

Most improvements relate to the reduction of false negatives, which fall into three groups: (a) entities occurring infrequently or partially in the labeled training data (e.g. uranium); (b) domain-specific entities sharing lexical or contextual features with the POL entities (e.g. Linux, titanium); and (c) words with Latin characters, common in the science and technology domains. (a) and (b) are mostly transliterations into Arabic. An alternativeand simplerapproach to controlling the precision-recall tradeoff is the Minkov et al. (2006) strategy of tuning a single feature weight subsequent to learning (see 4.1 above). We performed an oracle experiment to determine how this compares to recall-oriented learning in our setting. An oracle trained with the method of Minkov et al. outperforms the three models in table 5 that use the regular perceptron for the supervised phase of learning, but underperforms the supervised ROP conditions.20 Overall, we find that incorporating the recalloriented bias in learning is fruitful for adapting to Wikipedia because the gains in recall outpace the damage to precision. 6 Discussion To our know</context>

A loss function to encourage recall over precision during supervised discriminative learning substantially improves recall and overall entity detection performance, especially when combined with a semisupervised learning regimen incorporating the same bias. We have also developed a small corpus of Arabic Wikipedia articles via a flexible entity annotation scheme spanning four topical domains (publicly available at http://www.ark.cs. cmu.edu/AQMAR).</context>

Ideally, an NER system would refine the traditional classes (Hovy et al., 2011) or identify new entity classes when they arise in new domains, adapting to new data. For this reason, we believe it is valuable to consider NER systems that identify (but do not necessarily label) entity mentions, and also to consider annotation schemes that allow annotators more freedom in defining entity classes. Our aim in creating an annotated dataset is to provide a testbed for evaluation of new NER models. We will use these data as development and sible NEs (Sekine et al., 2002). Nezda et al.

There is evidence that models trained on Wikipedia data generalize and perform well on corpora with narrower domains. Nothman et al. (2009) and Balasuriya et al.

This is abundantly clear in technical and scientific discourse, where much of the terminology is domain-specific, but it holds elsewhere. Non-POL entities in the history domain, for instance, include important events (wars, famines) and cultural movements (romanticism). Ignoring such domain-critical entities likely limits the usefulness of the NE analysis. Recognizing this limitation, some work on NER has sought to codify more robust inventories of general-purpose entity types (Sekine et al., 2002; Weischedel and Brunstein, 2005; Grouin et al., 2011) or to enumerate domain-specific types (Settles, 2004; Yao et al., 2003). Coarse, general-purpose categories have also been used for semantic tagging of nouns and verbs (Ciaramita and Johnson, 2003). Yet as the number of classes or domains grows, rigorously documenting and organizing the classeseven for a single languagerequires intensive effort.

We assigned short names to these suggestions, seen in table 3. In 13 cases, both annotators suggested a category for an article that was essentially the same (); three such categories spanned multiple articles. In three cases a category was suggested by only one annotator ().5 Thus, we see that our annotators were generally, but not entirely, consistent with each other in their creation of custom categories. Further, almost all of our article-specific categories correspond to classes in the extended NE taxonomy of (Sekine et al., 2002), which speaks to the reasonableness of both sets of categoriesand by extension, our open-ended annotation process. Our annotation of named entities outside of the traditional POL classes creates a useful resource for entity detection and recognition in new domains. Even the ability to detect non-canonical types of NEs should help applications such as QA and MT (Toral et al., 2005; Babych and Hartley, 2003).

This is abundantly clear in technical and scientific discourse, where much of the terminology is domain-specific, but it holds elsewhere. Non-POL entities in the history domain, for instance, include important events (wars, famines) and cultural movements (romanticism). Ignoring such domain-critical entities likely limits the usefulness of the NE analysis. Recognizing this limitation, some work on NER has sought to codify more robust inventories of general-purpose entity types (Sekine et al., 2002; Weischedel and Brunstein, 2005; Grouin et al., 2011) or to enumerate domain-specific types (Settles, 2004; Yao et al., 2003).

As all are broad areas of research, we highlight only the most relevant contributions here. Research in Arabic NER has been focused on compiling and optimizing the gazetteers and fea169 \x0cture sets for standard sequential modeling algorithms (Benajiba et al., 2008; Farber et al., 2008; Shaalan and Raza, 2008; Abdul-Hamid and Darwish, 2010). We make use of features identified in this prior work to construct a strong baseline system. We are unaware of any Arabic NER work that has addressed diverse text domains like Wikipedia. Both the English and Arabic versions of Wikipedia have been used, however, as resources in service of traditional NER (Kazama and Torisawa, 2007; Benajiba et al., 2008). Attia et al. (2010) heuristically induce a mapping between Arabic Wikipedia and Arabic WordNet to construct Arabic NE gazetteers. Balasuriya et al. (2009) highlight the substantial divergence between entities </context>

Here, in contrast, we use labeled target-domain data only for tuning and evaluation. Another important distinction is that domain variation in this prior work is restricted to topically-related corpora (e.g. newswire vs. broadcast news), whereas in our work, major topical differences distinguish the training and test corporaand consequently, their salient NE classes. In these respects our NER setting is closer to that of Florian et al. (2010), who recognize English entities in noisy text, (Surdeanu et al., 2011), which concerns information extraction in a topically distinct target domain, and (Dalton et al., 2011), which addresses English NER in noisy and topically divergent text. Self-training (Clark et al., 2003; Mihalcea, 2004; McClosky et al., 2006) is widely used in NLP and has inspired related techniques that learn from automatically labeled data (Liang et al., 2008; Petrov et al., 2010). Our self-training procedure differs from some others in that we use all of the automatically labeled examples, rather than filtering them based on a confidence score.

Our annotation of named entities outside of the traditional POL classes creates a useful resource for entity detection and recognition in new domains.

Experiments show consistent gains on the challenging problem of identifying named entities in Arabic Wikipedia text. 2 Arabic Wikipedia NE Annotation Most of the effort in NER has been focused around a small set of domains and general-purpose entity classes relevant to those domainsespecially the categories PER(SON), ORG(ANIZATION), and LOC(ATION) (POL), which are highly prominent in news text. Arabic is no exception: the publicly available NER corporaACE (Walker et al., 2006), ANER (Benajiba et al., 2008), and OntoNotes (Hovy et al., 2006)all are in the news domain.2 However, 2 OntoNotes contains news-related text. ACE includes some text from blogs. In addition to the POL classes, both corpora include additional NE classes such as facility, event, product, vehicle, etc. These entities are infrequent and may not be comprehensive enough to cover the larger set of pos162 \x0cHistory Science Sports Technology dev: Damascus Atom Raul Gonzales Linux Imam Hussein Shrine Nuclear power Real Madrid Solaris test: Crusades Enrico Fermi 2004 Summer Olympics Computer Islamic Go</context>

A larger set of Arabic Wikipedia articles, selected on the basis of quality heuristics, serves as unlabeled data for semisupervised learning. Our out-of-domain labeled NE data is drawn from the ANER (Benajiba et al., 2007) and ACE-2005 (Walker et al., 2006) newswire corpora. Entity types in this data are POL categories (PER, ORG, LOC) and MIS.
