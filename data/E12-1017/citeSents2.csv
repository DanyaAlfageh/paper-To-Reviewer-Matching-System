Here we adapt self-training, a simple technique that leverages a supervised learner (like the perceptron) to perform semisupervised learning (CITATION; CITATION; CITATION),,
Cost functions have been used in nonstructured classification settings to penalize certain types of errors more than others (CITATION; CITATION; CITATION),,
In these respects our NER setting is closer to that of CITATION, who recognize English entities in noisy text, CITATION, which concerns information extraction in a topically distinct target domain, and CITATION, which addresses English NER in noisy and topically divergent text,,
Self-training (CITATION; CITATION; CITATION) is widely used in NLP and has inspired related techniques that learn from automatically labeled data (CITATION; CITATION),,
