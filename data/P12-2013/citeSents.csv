1 Basic Features We use two basic features, namely Negative and Positive sentiment towards specific discussants and entities like in the work done by CITATION,,
 We use OpinionFinder CITATION which employs negative and positive polarity cues,,
 We apply variants on Latent Dirichelet Allocation (LDA) based topic models to the problem CITATION,,
 Accordingly, we extract all the named entities in a sentence using Stanfords Name Entity Recognizer CITATION,,
 Hence we apply LDA CITATION on texts to extract latent semantics of texts,,
 However as a simplifying assumption, similar to the work of CITATION, we adopt the view that replies in the sentences that are determined to be attitudinal and contain secondperson pronouns (you, your, yourself) are assumed to be directed towards the recipients of the replies,,

 Hence we apply LDA CITATION on texts to extract latent semantics of texts,,
 CITATION deal with the problem of finding opinions from comparative sentences,,
 Many previous research efforts related to Opinion Target Identification (CITATION; CITATION; CITATION), focus on the domain of product reviews where they exploit the genre in multiple ways,,
 CITATION used unsupervised methods to identify stances in online debates,,
 We use the Gibbs sampling based LDA CITATION,,

 CITATION used unsupervised methods to identify stances in online debates,,
 Given a thread, the annotator is asked to identify if there are any sub-groups among the discussants with similar opinions, and if yes, the membership of those 1 We also experimented with K-means CITATION and found that it yields worse results compared to SLINK,,
3 Clustering Attitude Space A tree-based (hierarchical) clustering algorithm, SLINK CITATION is used to cluster the vector space,,
1 We choose the number of clusters to be d pn 2 e, described as the rule of thumb by CITATION, where n is the number of discussants in the group,,
