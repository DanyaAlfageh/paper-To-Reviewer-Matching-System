 (2003), Culotta and Sorensen (2004) and Bunescu and Mooney CITATION,,
 Bunescu and Mooney CITATION proposed another dependency tree kernel for relation extraction,,
 Since Zhao and Grishman CITATION use a 5-fold cross-validation on a subset of the 2004 data (newswire and broadcast news domains, containing 348 documents and 4400 relation instances), for comparison, we use the same setting (5-fold cross-validation on the same subset of the 2004 data, but the 5 partitions may not be the same) for the ACE 2004 data,,
 CITATION: feature-based SVM 77,,
6) Bunescu and Mooney CITATION: shortest path dependency kernel 65,,
 That is, it is 4 Bunescu and Mooney CITATION used the ACE 2002 corpus, including 422 documents, which is known to have many inconsistencies than the 2003 version,,
 Moreover, the difference between our method and Bunescu and Mooney CITATION is that their kernel is defined on the shortest path between two entities instead of the entire subtrees,,
 In our implementation, we use the binary SVMLight CITATION and Tree Kernel Tools (Moschitti, 2004),,
