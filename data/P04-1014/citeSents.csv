6 Estimation in Practice The gold standard dependency structures are produced by running our CCG parser over the normal-form derivations in CCGbank (CITATIONa),,
The entries within spanning derivations form a feature forest CITATION,,
Initially we tried the parallel version of GIS described in CITATION to perform the estimation, running over the Beowulf cluster,,
CITATION shows that this supertagging method results in a highly efficient parser,,
CITATIONa) uses a model which favours only one of the derivations leading to a derived structure, namely the normal-form derivation CITATION,,
And finally, we show that the parsing algorithm described in CITATION is extremely slow in some cases, and suggest an efficient alternative based on CITATION,,

1 Introduction A number of statistical parsing models have recently been developed for Combinatory Categorial Grammar (CCG; CITATION) and used in parsers applied to the WSJ Penn Treebank (CITATION; CITATION; CITATIONb),,
Following CITATION, we showed how the estimation can be performed efficiently by applying the inside-outside algorithm to a packed chart,,
f(d) i 2 i 1 See CITATION for a similar description in the context of ,,
Hockenmaier also found the dependencies to be very beneficial in contrast to recent results from the lexicalised PCFG parsing literature CITATION but did not gain from the use of distance measures,,
The feature set for the normal-form model is the same except that, following CITATION, the dependency features are defined in terms of the local rule instantiations, by adding the heads of the combining categories to the rule instantiation features,,
prior term, G(), used to reduce overfitting CITATION,,
4 Packed Charts The packed charts perform a number of roles: they are a compact representation of a very large number of CCG derivations; they allow recovery of the highest scoring parse or dependency structure without enumerating all derivations; and they represent an instance of what CITATION call a feature forest, which is used to efficiently estimate a log-linear model,,
Our normal-form parser significantly outperforms the parser of CITATION and produces results at least as good as the current state-of-the-art for CCG parsing,,
The parser uses a maximum entropy supertagger CITATION to assign lexical \x0ccategories to the words in a sentence, and applies the CKY chart parsing algorithm described in CITATION,,
Following CITATION, evaluation is by precision and recall over dependencies,,
Second, we find that GIS is unsuitable for estimating a model of the size being considered, and develop a parallel version of the L-BFGS algorithm CITATION,,
rd dependency structures are produced by running our CCG parser over the normal-form derivations in CCGbank (CITATIONa),,
For the normal-form model we were able to reduce the size of the charts considerably by applying two types of restriction to the parser: first, categories can only combine if they appear together in a rule instantiation in sections 221 of CCGbank; and second, we apply the normal-form restrictions described in CITATION,,
The presence of such ambiguity, sometimes referred to as spurious ambiguity, enables CCG to produce elegant analyses of coordination and extraction phenomena CITATION,,
They use a conditional model, based on CITATION, which, as the authors acknowledge, has a number of theoretical deficiencies; thus the results of Clark et al,,
This extends the approach of CITATION who modelled the dependency structures directly, not using any information from the derivations,,
apply the normal-form restrictions described in CITATION,,
CITATION,,
L-BFGS over forests can be parallelised, using the method described in CITATION to calculate the feature expectations,,
CITATION and CITATION,,
Setting the gradient to zero yields the usual maximum entropy constraints CITATION, except that in this case the empirical values are themselves expectations (over all derivations leading to each gold standard dependency structure),,
In CITATION we argued for the use of log-linear parsing models for CCG,,
This latter sum can be calculated efficiently using inside and outside scores: max = arg max X 1 ZS X cC cc if deps(c) (12) where c is the inside score and c is the outside score for node c (see CITATION); C is the set of conjunctive nodes in the packed chart for sentence S and deps(c) is the set of dependencies on conjunctive node c,,
The dependency structures considered in this paper are described in detail in CITATION and CITATION,,
CITATION show how the sum over the complete derivation space can be performed efficiently using a packed chart and a variant of the inside-outside algorithm,,
CITATION shows that the normal-form constraints significantly increase parsing speed and, in combination with adaptive supertagging, result in a highly efficient wide-coverage parser,,
We use the novel strategy developed in CITATION: first assign a small number of categories (approximately 1.4) on average to each word, and increase the number of categories if the parser fails to find an analysis,,
The expected values can be calculated using the method in CITATION,,
The objective function of a model is the conditional log-likelihood, L(), minus a Gaussian prior term, G(), used to reduce overfitting CITATION,,
