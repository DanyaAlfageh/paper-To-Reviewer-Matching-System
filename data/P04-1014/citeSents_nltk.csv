Setting the gradient to zero yields the usual maximum entropy constraints CITATION, except that in this case the empirical values are themselves expectations (over all derivations leading to each gold standard dependency structure).,,
3.1 The Dependency Model We follow CITATION in using a discriminative estimation method by maximising the conditional likelihood of the model given the data.,,
The objective function of a model is the conditional log-likelihood, L(), minus a Gaussian prior term, G(), used to reduce overfitting CITATION.,,
We use a technique from the numerical optimisation literature, the L-BFGS algorithm CITATION, to optimise the objective function.,,
1 Introduction A number of statistical parsing models have recently been developed for Combinatory Categorial Grammar (CCG; CITATION) and used in parsers applied to the WSJ Penn Treebank (CITATION; CITATION; CITATIONb).,,
In CITATION we argued for the use of log-linear parsing models for CCG.,,
Following CITATION, we showed how the estimation can be performed efficiently by applying the inside-outside algorithm to a packed chart.,,
This extends the approach of CITATION who modelled the dependency structures directly, not using any information from the derivations.,,
The dependency structures considered in this paper are described in detail in CITATION and CITATION.,,
CITATION show how the sum over the complete derivation space can be performed efficiently using a packed chart and a variant of the inside-outside algorithm.,,
3.2 The Normal-Form Model The objective function and gradient vector for the normal-form model are as follows: L0 () = L() G() (6) = log m Y j=1 P(dj|Sj) n X i=1 2 i 22 i L0() i = m X j=1 fi(dj) (7) m X j=1 X d(Sj) e. f(d) fi(d) P d(Sj) e. f(d) i 2 i 1 See CITATION for a similar description in the context of,,
The expected values can be calculated using the method in CITATION.,,
For the normal-form model we were able to reduce the size of the charts considerably by applying two types of restriction to the parser: first, categories can only combine if they appear together in a rule instantiation in sections 221 of CCGbank; and second, we apply the normal-form restrictions described in CITATION.,,
(See CITATION for a description of the Eisner constraints.),,
Initially we tried the parallel version of GIS described in CITATION to perform the estimation, running over the Beowulf cluster.,,
CITATION.,,
L-BFGS over forests can be parallelised, using the method described in CITATION to calculate the feature expectations.,,
This latter sum can be calculated efficiently using inside and outside scores: max = arg max X 1 ZS X cC cc if deps(c) (12) where c is the inside score and c is the outside score for node c (see CITATION); C is the set of conjunctive nodes in the packed chart for sentence S and deps(c) is the set of dependencies on conjunctive node c. The intuition behind the expected recall score is that a dependency structure scores highly if it has dependencies produced by high scoring derivations.4 The algorithm which finds max is a simple variant on the Viterbi algorithm, efficiently finding a derivation which produces the highest scoring set of dependencies.,,
6 Estimation in Practice The gold standard dependency structures are produced by running our CCG parser over the normal-form derivations in CCGbank (CITATIONa).,,
The parser uses a maximum entropy supertagger CITATION to assign lexical \x0ccategories to the words in a sentence, and applies the CKY chart parsing algorithm described in CITATION.,,
For the normal-form model we were able to reduce the size of the charts considerably by applying two types of restriction to the parser: first, categories can only combine if they appear together in a rule instantiation in sections 221 of CCGbank; and second, we apply the normal-form restrictions described in CITATION.,,
(See CITATION for a description of the Eisner constraints.),,
Initially we tried the parallel version of GIS described in CITATION to perform the estimation, running over the Beowulf cluster.,,
CITATION.,,
We use the novel strategy developed in CITATION: first assign a small number of categories (approximately 1.4) on average to each word, and increase the number of categories if the parser fails to find an analysis.,,
CITATION shows that this supertagging method results in a highly efficient parser.,,
CITATION shows that the normal-form constraints significantly increase parsing speed and, in combination with adaptive supertagging, result in a highly efficient wide-coverage parser.,,

This paper assumes a basic understanding of CCG; see CITATION for an introduction, and CITATION and CITATIONa) for an introduction to statistical parsing with CCG.,,
The presence of such ambiguity, sometimes referred to as spurious ambiguity, enables CCG to produce elegant analyses of coordination and extraction phenomena CITATION.,,
CITATION handle the additional derivations by model,,
CITATIONa) uses a model which favours only one of the derivations leading to a derived structure, namely the normal-form derivation CITATION.,,
This extends the approach of CITATION who modelled the dependency structures directly, not using any information from the derivations.,,
The dependency structures considered in this paper are described in detail in CITATION and CITATION.,,
CITATION shows that this supertagging method results in a highly efficient parser.,,
Following CITATION, evaluation is by precision and recall over dependencies.,,
The results of CITATION and CITATIONa) are shown for comparison.,,
Our normal-form parser significantly outperforms the parser of CITATION and produces results at least as good as the current state-of-the-art for CCG parsing.,,
The presence of such ambiguity, sometimes referred to as spurious ambiguity, enables CCG to produce elegant analyses of coordination and extraction phenomena CITATION.,,
CITATION handle the additional derivations by modelling the derived structure, in their case dependency structures.,,
They use a conditional model, based on CITATION, which, as the authors acknowledge, has a number of theoretical deficiencies; thus the results of Clark et al.,,
CITATIONa) uses a model which favours only one of the derivations leading to a derived structure, namely the normal-form derivation CITATION.,,
Table 3 also gives the results if automatically assigned POS tags are used in the training and testing phases, using the C&C POS tagger CITATION.,,

Following CITATION, we showed how the estimation can be performed efficiently by applying the inside-outside algorithm to a packed chart.,,
4 Packed Charts The packed charts perform a number of roles: they are a compact representation of a very large number of CCG derivations; they allow recovery of the highest scoring parse or dependency structure without enumerating all derivations; and they represent an instance of what CITATION call a feature forest, which is used to efficiently estimate a log-linear model.,,
The entries within spanning derivations form a feature forest CITATION.,,
Second, we find that GIS is unsuitable for estimating a model of the size being considered, and develop a parallel version of the L-BFGS algorithm CITATION.,,
