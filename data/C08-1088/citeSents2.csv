While kernel methods using the dependency tree CITATION and the shortest dependency path CITATION suffer from low recall performance, convolution tree kernels (CITATION; CITATION) over syntactic parse trees achieve,,
This dependency relationship offers a very condensed representation of the information needed to assess the relationship in the forms of the dependency tree CITATION or the shortest dependency path CITATION that includes both entities,,
From prior work (Zelenko et al., 2003; CITATION; CITATION) to current research (CITATION; CITATION), kernel methods have been showing more and more potential in relation extraction,,
For those interested in feature-based methods, please refer to CITATION for more details,,
CITATION develop a shortest path dependency tree kernel, which simply counts the number of common word classes at each node in the shortest paths between two entities in dependency trees,,
CITATION proposed a slightly generalized version of this kernel between dependency trees, in which a successful match of two relation instances requires the nodes to be at the same layer and in the identical path starting from the roots to the current nodes,,
However, detailed research CITATION shows that its difficult to extract new effective features to further improve the extraction accuracy,,
