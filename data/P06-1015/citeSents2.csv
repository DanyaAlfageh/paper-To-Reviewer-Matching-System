ntroduction Recent attention to knowledge-rich problems such as question answering CITATION and textual entailment CITATION has encouraged natural language processing researchers to develop algorithms for automatically harvesting shallow semantic resources,,
To date, researchers have harvested, with varying success, several resources, including concept lists CITATION, topic signatures CITATION, facts CITATION, and word similarity lists CITATION,,
Many recent efforts have also focused on extracting semantic relations between entities, such as entailments CITATION, is-a CITATION, part-of CITATION, and other relations,,
