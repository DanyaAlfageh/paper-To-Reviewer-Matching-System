d measuring the matching of lexical items to incorporate information about the semantic structure of the sentence, as in CITATION,,
 However, the metric should also be flexible to consider inexact matches of semantic components, similar to what is done with lexical metrics like METEOR CITATION,,
 The metric is particularly dependent on semantic role label117 \x0cing systems, which have reached satisfactory performance for English CITATION,,
 Verbs are aligned using VerbNet CITATION and VerbOcean CITATION,,
 VerbOcean was created by a semi-automatic extraction algorithm CITATION with an average accuracy of 65,,
 A number of other metrics have been proposed to address these limitations, for example, by allowing for the matching of synonyms or paraphrases of content words, such as in METEOR CITATION,,

 3 Metric Description The rationale behind TINE is that an adequacyoriented metric should go beyond measuring the matching of lexical items to incorporate information about the semantic structure of the sentence, as in CITATION,,
 However, the metric should also be flexible to consider inexact matches of semantic components, similar to what is done with lexical metrics like METEOR CITATION,,
 The metric is particularly dependent on semantic role label117 \x0cing systems, which have reached satisfactory performance for English CITATION,,
23) on a development dataset CITATION,,
 We compare our metric against standard BLEU CITATION, METEOR CITATION and other previous metrics reported in CITATION which also claim to use some form of semantic information (see Section 2 for their description),,

 The metric uses SRLs such as in CITATION,,
 The closest related metric to the one proposed in this paper is that by CITATION and CITATION, which also uses shallow semantic representations,,
