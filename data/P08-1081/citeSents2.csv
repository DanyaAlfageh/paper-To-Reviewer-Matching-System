CITATION used statistical translation model to find the appropriate answers from their QA pair collections from FAQ pages for the posted question,,
The method of finding follow-up questions CITATION from TREC context track could be adapted for context detection,,
(CITATION; CITATION; CITATION; CITATION; CITATION),,
In our other work CITATION, we proposed a supervised approach for question detection and an unsupervised approach for answer detection without considering context detection,,
(See Section 3.4 for more about CRFs) Linear CRF model has been successfully applied in NLP and text mining tasks (CITATION; CITATION),,
To this end, we proposed a general framework to detect contexts and answers based on Conditional Random Fields CITATION (CRFs) which are able to model the sequential dependencies between contiguous nodes,,
