On a 10,000 word subset of the neologism archive CITATION, the best method of combining character n-grams and regular expression matching yields an accuracy of 96.32% and an F-score of 59.4 (P = 75.8%, R = 48.8%),,

4.2 Parser The parsing experiments were performed with a state-of-the-art parser trained on the TIGER corpus which returns both phrase categories and grammatical functions (CITATIONb),,
Following CITATION, the parser uses an unlexicalized probabilistic context-free grammar (PCFG) and relies on treebank transformations to increase parsing accuracy,,
Based upon an evaluation on the NEGRA treebank CITATION, using a 90%-5%-5% training-development-test split, the parser performs with an accuracy of 73.1 F,,
In addition, we also report dependency accuracy (Dep), calculated using the approach described in CITATION, using the headpicking method used by CITATIONa),,
