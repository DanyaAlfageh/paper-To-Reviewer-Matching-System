Using our guidelines, RTE3 test was annotated by NIST as part of the RTE3 Pilot task in which systems made a 3-way decision as to whether pairs of sentences were entailed, contradictory, or neither CITATION.1 Our annotations and those of NIST were performed on the original RTE datasets, contrary to CITATION,,
The PASCAL Recognizing Textual Entailment (RTE) Challenges (CITATION; CITATION; CITATION) focused on textual inference in any domain,,
Contrary to CITATION, we argue that recognizing embedded contradictions is important for the application of a contradiction detection system: if John thinks that he is incompetent, and his boss believes that John is not being given a chance, one would like to detect that the targeted information in the two sentences is contradictory, even though the two sentences can be true simultaneously,,
4 This stands in contrast with the low inter-annotator agreement reported by CITATION for contradictions in protein-protein interactions,,
LCC negation refers to performance of CITATION; Avg,,
s recognized in the MUC information extraction tasks in which it was key to identify scenarios related to the same event CITATION,,
of event coreference was recognized in the MUC information extraction tasks in which it was key to identify scenarios related to the same event CITATION,,
To our knowledge, CITATION provide the first empirical results for contradiction detection, but they focus on specific kinds of contradiction: those featuring negation and those formed by paraphrases,,
While mismatching information between sentences is often a good cue of non-entailment CITATION, it is not sufficient for contradiction detection which requires more precise comprehension of the consequences of sentences,,
Similarity measures and structural information are combined via weights learned using the passiveaggressive online learning algorithm MIRA CITATION,,
Factivity classes are formed by clustering our expansion of the PARC lists of factive, implicative and non-factive verbs CITATION according to how they create contradiction,,
The importance of event coreference was recognized in the MUC information extraction tasks in which it was key to identify scenarios related to the same event CITATION,,
antonymy, negation, and numeric mismatch contradictions; each involves only a closed set of words or data that can be obtained using existing resources and techniques (e.g., WordNet CITATION, VerbOcean CITATION),,
Presently, there exist methods for learning oppositional terms CITATION and paraphrase learning has been thoroughly studied, but successfully extending these techniques to learn incompatible phrases poses difficulties because of the data distribution,,
The text and hypothesis are converted to typed dependency graphs produced by the Stanford parser (CITATION; de Marneffe et al., 2006),,
There is a continuum of topicality from the start to the end of a sentence CITATION,,
Additionally, little external information is needed to gain broad coverage of antonymy, negation, and numeric mismatch contradictions; each involves only a closed set of words or data that can be obtained using existing resources and techniques (e.g., WordNet CITATION, VerbOcean CITATION),,
Presently, there exist methods for learning oppositional terms CITATION and paraphrase learning has been thoroughly studied, but successfully extending these techniques to learn incompatible phrases poses difficulties because of the data distri,,
Most entailment systems function as weak proof theory (CITATION; MacCartney et al., 2006; CITATION), but contradictions require deeper inferences and model building,,
