Although this figure is very low, it is not surprising: the results on the English ACE 2005 corpus show that the inter-annotator agreement on trigger identification is only about 40% CITATION.,,
The second reason is that it is hard to identify an event mention due to the failure of following specified annotation guidelines, as mentioned in CITATION.,,
CITATION compared the use of overt subjects in English and Chinese and he found that overt subjects occupy over 96% in English, while this percentage drops to only 64% in Chinese.,,
