Following CITATIONb), we randomly select 567 documents as the training set and the remaining 66 documents as the test set,,
The second reason is that it is hard to identify an event mention due to the failure of following specified annotation guidelines, as mentioned in CITATION,,

Although this figure is very low, it is not surprising: the results on the English ACE 2005 corpus show that the inter-annotator agreement on trigger identification is only about 40% CITATION,,

While earlier studies focus on sentence-level extraction (CITATION; CITATION; CITATION), later ones turn to employ high-level information, such as document (CITATION; CITATION; CITATION), cross-document CITATION, cross-event (CITATION; CITATION) and crossentity (Hong et al., 2011) information,,
CITATION compared the use of overt subjects in English and Chinese and he found that overt subjects occupy over 96% in English, while this percentage drops to only 64% in Chinese,,
(CITATION; Yangarber et al., 2007) applied cross-document inference to refine local extraction results for disease name, location and start/end time,,
2.2 Compositional Semantics Almost all the related studies on compositional semantics focus on how to combine words together to convey complex meanings, such as semantic parser (CITATION; CITATION; CITATION),,
CITATION used a similar approach to recover implicit time information for events,,
CITATION; CITATION; CITATION; CITATION; CITATION; CITATION; CITATION, 2011; CITATION; Hong et al., 2011),,
The second mechanism is enlightened by the wide use of discourse consistency in natural languages, particularly for Chinese, due to its discourse-driven nature CITATION,,
For evaluation, we follow the standards as defined in CITATION: A trigger is correctly identified if its position in the document matches a reference trigger; A trigger type is correctly determined if its event type and position in the document match a reference trigger; An argument is c,,

CITATIONa) proposed a bootstrapping framework, which exploited extra information captured by an English event extraction system,,
CITATION and Yangarber et al,,
CITATION discussed the internal structures inside Chinese nouns and used it in word segmentation,,
CITATION employed cross-event consistency information to improve sentence-level event extraction,,
To alleviate word segmentation errors to known triggers, CITATIONb) constructed a global errata table to record the inconsistency in the training set and proved its effectiveness,,
CITATION proposed some specific inference rules to improve extraction of personal information,,
CITATION extracted cross-lingual predicate clusters using bilingual parallel corpora and a cross-lingual information extraction system, and then used the derived clusters to improve the performance of Chinese event extraction,,
Besides, we use Stanford Parser (CITATION, CITATION) to create the constituent and dependency parse trees and employ the ME model to train individual component classifiers,,
It shows that our baseline system outperforms CITATIONb) by 1.8, 2.2, 3.9 and 2.3 in F1- measure on trigger identification, trigger type 3 http://ictclas.org/ 1008 \x0cdetermination, argument identification and argument role determination, respectively, with both gains in precision and recall,,
If a Chinese word contains more than one character, its meaning can be often inferred from the meanings of its component characters CITATION,,
3 Baseline As a baseline, we re-implement a state-of-the-art system, which consists of four typical components (trigger identification, trigger type determination, argument identification and argument role determination), in a pipeline way and employ the same set of features as described in CITATIONb),,
CITATION employed a rule-based approach to propagate consistent triggers and arguments across topicrelated documents,,
CITATIONb) applied various kinds of lexical, syntactic and semantic features to address the specific issues in Chinese,,
