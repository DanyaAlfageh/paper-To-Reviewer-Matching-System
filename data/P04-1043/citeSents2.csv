4.2 Classification set-up The classifier evaluations were carried out using the SVM-light software CITATION available at svmlight.joachims.org with the default polynomial kernel for standard feature evaluations,,
These standard features, firstly proposed in CITATION, refer to a flat information derived from parse trees, i.e,,
