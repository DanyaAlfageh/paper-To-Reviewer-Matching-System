This kind of kernel has the drawback of assigning more weight to larger structures while the argument type does not strictly depend on the size of the argument CITATION,,
3.3 Predicate/Argument structure Kernel (PAK) Given the semantic objects defined in the previous section, we design a convolution kernel in a way similar to the parse-tree kernel proposed in CITATION,,
(CITATION; CITATION; CITATION),,
2.2 Support Vector Machine approach Given a vector space in &lt;n and a set of positive and negative points, SVMs classify vectors according to a separating hyperplane, H(~ x) = ~ w ~ x + b = 0, where ~ w &lt;n and b &lt; are learned by applying the Structural Risk Minimization principle CITATION,,
CITATION to generate parse-trees automatically,,
In other words, CArg0 = Position XOR Voice, which is the classical example of a non-linear separable function that becomes separable in a superlinear space CITATION,,
CITATION claim that semantic information in natural language texts is connected to syntactic structures,,
In particular, these problems affect the processing of predicate argument structures annotated in PropBank CITATION or FrameNet CITATION,,
These standard features, firstly proposed in CITATION, refer to a flat information derived from parse trees, i.e,,
Several machine learning approaches for argument identification and classification have been developed (CITATION; CITATION; CITATION; CITATION),,
eanu et al., 2003; CITATION),,
82.0% in CITATION,,
In CITATION, it has been shown that P i Ii(nx)Ii(nz) = (nx, nz) can be computed in O(|Nx ||Nz|) by the following recursive relation: (1) if the productions at nx and nz are different then (nx, nz) = 0; 2 A fragment can appear several times in a parse-tree, thus each fragment occurrence is considered as a different element in F 0 p,a,,
The sentences were processed using Collins parser CITATION to generate parse-trees automatically,,
It is worth noting that even if the above equations define a kernel function similar to the one proposed in CITATION, the substructures on which it operates are different from the parse-tree kernel,,
\x0cis substantially equal to the SVM performance (88%) obtained in CITATION with degree 2 and (c) the accuracy on FrameNet (85.2%) is higher than the best result obtained in literature, i.e,,
For the FrameNet corpus (www.icsi.berkeley 3 It can be proven that the resulting kernels still satisfy Mercers conditions CITATION,,
PropBank contains about 53,700 sentences and a fixed split between training and testing which has been used in other researches e.g., (CITATION; CITATION; CITATION),,
4.2 Classification set-up The classifier evaluations were carried out using the SVM-light software CITATION available at svmlight.joachims.org with the default polynomial kernel for standard feature evaluations,,
We adopted this solution as it is simple and effective CITATION,,
