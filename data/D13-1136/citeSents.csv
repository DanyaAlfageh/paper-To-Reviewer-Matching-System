This approach is inspired by previous work designed to connect words and Wordnet CITATION,,
RIEDEL CITATION and MINTZ CITATION,,
CITATION proposed the first work aiming to perform RE employing both K,,
ors based on Wikipedia infoboxes and corresponding sentences (CITATION; CITATION),,
CITATION) also rely on weak supervision, since they learn models from a seed KB in order to extend it,,
Results Figure 1 displays the aggregate precision / recall curves of our approach WSABIEM2R+FB which uses the combination of Sm2r + Skb, as well as WSABIEM2R , which only uses Sm2r , and existing state-of-the-art approaches: HOFFMANN CITATION2, MIMLRE CITATION,,
Since this type of learning problem is weakly supervised, CITATION showed that a convenient way to train it is by using a ranking loss,,
Entities were found using the Stanford named entity tagger CITATION, and were matched to their name in Freebase,,
2 Previous Work Learning under weak supervision is common in natural language processing, especially for tasks where the annotation costs are significant such as in se1366 \x0cmantic parsing (CITATION; CITATION; CITATION; CITATION),,
Weak supervision is also a popular option for RE: CITATION used Freebase to train weakly supervised relational extractors on Wikipedia, an approach generalized by the multi-instance learning frameworks (CITATION; CITATION; CITATION),,
However, performance metrics of relation extraction are sometimes measured using precision recall curves aggregated for all mentions concerning the same pair of entities, as in CITATION,,
earning under weak supervision is common in natural language processing, especially for tasks where the annotation costs are significant such as in se1366 \x0cmantic parsing (CITATION; CITATION; CITATION; CITATION),,
h,r,t, ||h||2 1, ||r||2 1, ||t||2 1, and training is performed using SGD, as in CITATION,,
Training is carried out by Stochastic Gradient Descent (SGD), updating W and r at each step, following (CITATION; CITATION),,
NYT+FB This dataset, developed by CITATION, aligns Freebase relations with the New York Times corpus,,
specially for tasks where the annotation costs are significant such as in se1366 \x0cmantic parsing (CITATION; CITATION; CITATION; CITATION),,
 CITATION),,
Weak supervision is also a popular option for RE: CITATION use,,
Recently, CITATION proposed another joint approach based on collaborative filtering for learning entity embeddings,,
CITATION proposed the first work aiming to perform RE employing both KB data and text, usi,,
supervision is common in natural language processing, especially for tasks where the annotation costs are significant such as in se1366 \x0cmantic parsing (CITATION; CITATION; CITATION; CITATION),,
4 Experiments We use the training and test data, evaluation framework and baselines from (CITATION; CITATION; CITATION),,
It was also used to train open extractors based on Wikipedia infoboxes and corresponding sentences (CITATION; CITATION),,
Modeling Following CITATION we set the embedding dimension k to 50,,
in (CITATION; CITATION; CITATION)): we chose in this work to follow the approach of CITATION, which is simple, flexible and has shown very promising results on Freebase data,,
CITATION proposed the first work aiming to perform RE employing both KB data and text, using a rule-based random walk method,,
Our scoring approach is inspired by previous work for connecting word labels and images CITATION, which we adapted, replacing images by mentions and word labels by relationships,,
CITATION) we set the embedding dimension k to 50,,
