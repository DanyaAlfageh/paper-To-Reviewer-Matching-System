In seminar announcements, a given field (speaker, start time, etc.) should appear with at most one value in each announcement, although the field and value may be repeated CITATION,,
al constraints on the label sequence are motivated by common sense: For named entity recognition, a phrase that appears multiple times should tend to get the same label each time CITATION,,
The situation improves with discriminatively trained models, such as conditional random fields CITATION, which do efficiently allow features that are functions of the entire observation sequence,,
There are several other constraints that we will describe later CITATION,,
Such techniques include Gibbs sampling CITATION, a general-purpose Monte Carlo method, and integer linear programming (ILP), CITATION, a general-purpose exact framework for NP-complete problems,,
In bibliography entries CITATION, a given field (author, title, etc.) should be filled by at most one substring of the input, and there are strong preferences on the cooccurrence and order of certain fields,,
