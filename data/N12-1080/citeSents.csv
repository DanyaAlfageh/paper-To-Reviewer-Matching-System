1 Temporal Information Extraction We use Heideltime, a rule-based system that uses sets of regular expressions, to extract explicit time expressions in the article and normalize them CITATION,,
 The approach is naive and is described in CITATION,,
, CITATION), we use Googles PageRank algorithm (Equation 8) with a damping factor d of 0,,
 Similarity(Si, Sj) = |{wk|wk Si&wk Sj}| log(|Si|) + log(|Sj|) (9) We use TextRank CITATION in our experiments,,
 For identification of named entities, we use Stanford NER CITATION,,
 CITATION introduced atomic events, which are named entities connected by a relation such as a verb or action noun,,
 CITATION identify events as triples consisting of two nodes and a relation,,

 CITATION extract event elements, the arguments in an event, and event terms, the actions,,
 CITATION investigate clustering towards organizing timestamped digital photographs,,
 To identify temporal event boundaries, CITATION calculate novelty scores,,
 1 Introduction Extensive research has gone into determining which features of text documents are useful for calculating the importance of sentences for extractive summarization, as well as how to use these features CITATION,,
 CITATION identify events as triples consisting of two nodes and a relation,,
 CITATION use the explicit time information in the context of multi-document summarization for sentence extraction and detection of redundant sentences, ordering input documents by time,,
 CITATION extract event elements, the arguments in an event, and event terms, the actions,,
 We evaluate using ROUGE-2 bigram matching CITATION,,
