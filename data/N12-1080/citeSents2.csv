WS(Vi) = (1 d) (8) +d X VjIn(Vi) wj,i P vkOut(Vj) wj,k WS(Vj) Like several graph-based methods for sentence ranking for summarization (e.g., CITATION), we use Googles PageRank algorithm (Equation 8) with a damping factor d of 0.85,,
Similarity(Si, Sj) = |{wk|wk Si&wk Sj}| log(|Si|) + log(|Sj|) (9) We use TextRank CITATION in our experiments,,
For identification of named entities, we use Stanford NER CITATION,,
