The idea of building a projective tree by means of lifting appears in CITATION and is used by CITATION and (Hudson, unpublished),,
This idea can also be compared to the notion of word order domain (CITATION; CITATION), to the Slash feature of GPSG and HPSG, to the functional uncertainty of LFG, and to the Move-a of GB theory,,
See for example (CITATION; CITATION), who also discuss Early-style parsers for projective dependency grammars,,
Thus, the derived structure resembles more a unistratal dependency representation like those used by CITATION,,
For example, we can impose that each node x is lifted to the highest ancestor of x covered by ~2&quot; (CITATION),,

Thus, the derived structure resembles more a unistratal dependency representation like those used by CITATION than the multistratal representations of, for example, (Mel\&apos;~uk, 1988),,

2.2 Projectivity The notion of projectivity was introduced by CITATION and has received several different definitions since then,,
The definition given here is borrowed from CITATION and CITATION: Definition: An arc ~- is projective if and only if for every y covered by ~2-, y ~ x+,,
