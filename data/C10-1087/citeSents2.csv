To determine entailment, BIUTEE performs the following main steps: Preprocessing First, all documents are parsed and processed with standard tools for named entity recognition CITATION and coreference resolution,,
This state of affairs has started to change with the recent introduction of the RTE Pilot Search task (CITATIONb), in which assessed texts are situated within complete documents,,
4 The Baseline RTE System In this work we used BIUTEE, Bar-Ilan University Textual Entailment Engine (Bar-Haim et al., 2008; CITATION), a state of the art RTE system, as a baseline and as a basis for our discourse-based enhancements,,
Under TE, the relationship between a text (T) and a textual assertion (hypothesis, H) is defined such that T entails H if humans reading T would infer that H is most likely true CITATION,,
Textual Entailment (TE) is a generic framework for applied semantic inference CITATION,,
TE has been successfully applied to a variety of natural language processing applications, including information extraction CITATION and question answering CITATION,,
