In recent work, CITATION prove that a classifier has low generalization error if it agrees on unlabeled data with a second classifier based on a different view of the data,,
CITATION add a special final round to boost recall, yielding 91.2/80.0/85.2 for the Yarowsky algorithm and 91.3/80.1/85.3 for their version of the original co-training algorithm,,
The following theorem is based on CITATION,,
First, CITATION assume the same conditional independence assumption as proposed by Blum and Mitchell,,
Current work has been spurred by two papers, CITATION and CITATION,,
Then the initial precision is 1 CITATION, citing CITATION, actually uses a superficially different score that is, however, a monotone transform of precision, hence equivalent to precision, since it is used only for sorting,,
6 Some Data The empirical investigations described here and below use the data set of CITATION,,
The second lack is emended in CITATION,,
