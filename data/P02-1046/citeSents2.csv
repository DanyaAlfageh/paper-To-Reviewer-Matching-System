Current work has been spurred by two papers, CITATION and CITATION,,
CITATION add a special final round to boost recall, yielding 91.2/80.0/85.2 for the Yarowsky algorithm and 91.3/80.1/85.3 for their version of the original co-training algorithm,,
6 Some Data The empirical investigations described here and below use the data set of CITATION,,
Then the initial precision is 1 CITATION, citing CITATION, actually uses a superficially different score that is, however, a monotone transform of precision, hence equivalent to precision, since it is used only for sorting,,
