CITATION develop a nonparametric Bayesian model of name structure using adaptor grammars, which they use to distinguish ,,
We ran the Stanford Named Entity Recognition system CITATION to obtain a set of 25,000 candidate mentions which the system judged to be names of people,,
Typical NER systems do not attempt to discover the internal structure of names or a database of canonical names, although they often use prefabricated gazetteers of names and name parts as features to improve performance (CITATION; CITATION),,
We do not undertake the problem of named entity recognition (Tjong Kim CITATION), but rather apply an existing NER system as a preprocessing step CITATION,,
CITATION shows that it is possible to learn a model of name structure, either by using coreference information as labeled data, or by leveraging a small set of hand-crafted constraints,,
Data Evaluation was performed on a corpus of blogs describing United States politics in 2008 CITATION,,
