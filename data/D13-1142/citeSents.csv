 Plagiarism detection methods (CITATION; CITATION) have a task of verifying the originality of the document,,
 Methods range from simple exact substring matching to more advanced ones like semantic based methods that are able to recognize paraphrasing and refactoring CITATION,,
1 Longest chunk This method is based on natural language processing and extensively uses NLTK package CITATION; the text is first tokenized with the default NLTK tokenizer, and then POS tagged with one of the included POS taggers,,
 It can be used in many applications such as summarization, educational systems, finding duplicated bug reports in software testing CITATION, plagiarism detection CITATION, and research of a scientific field CITATION,,
 Documents can vary in length from microblogs (Twitter) and sentences (CITATION; CITATION) to paragraphs CITATION and larger documents CITATION,,
 NER is a fairly researched field (CITATION; CITATION; CITATION; CITATION; CITATION) and is also used in several commercial applications such as Zemanta, OpenCalais and AlchemyAPI4, which are able to automatically insert links for a NE pointing to a knowledge base such as Wikipedia or IMDB,,
2 Latent Semantic Indexing (LSI) based A corpus is represented in LSI CITATION as a large matrix of term occurrences 1401 \x0cin individual documents,,
 We have used a tool called gensim CITATION that enabled us to quickly train a LSI model using the whole corpus and index just the related articles,,
