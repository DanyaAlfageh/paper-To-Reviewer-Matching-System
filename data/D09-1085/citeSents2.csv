Finally, some researchers have argued that the Parseval metrics CITATION are too forgiving with respect to certain errors and that an evaluation based on syntactic dependencies, for which scores are typically lower, is a better test of parser performance (CITATION; CITATION),,
First, the single score is an aggregate over a highly skewed distribution of all constituent types; evaluations which look at individual constituent or dependency types show that the accuracies on some, semantically important, constructions, such as coordination and PP-attachment, are much lower CITATION,,
Second, it is well known that the accuracy of parsers trained on the Penn Treebank degrades when they are applied to different genres and domains CITATION,,
