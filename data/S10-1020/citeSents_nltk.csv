We have collected a number of runs on the development data to optimize the performance level for a particular score: BLANC (Recasens and Hovy, in prep), MUC CITATION or CEAF CITATION.,,
We deliberately left the B-CUBE score CITATION completely out of our preliminary experiments.,,
Three runs have been submitted for the SemEval task 1 on Coreference Resolution (Recasens et al., 2010), optimizing Corrys performance for BLANC (Recasens and Hovy, in prep), MUC CITATION and CEAF CITATION.,,
It supports both local (CITATION-style) and global (ILP, CITATION-style) models of coreference.,,
Corry has only participated in the open setting, as it has already a number of preprocessing modules integrated into the system: the Stanford NLP toolkit for parsing CITATION and NE-tagging CITATION, Wo,,
Our global model is largely motivated by CITATION; 2008) and CITATION.,,
The following constraints suggested in the literature (CITATION; CITATION; CITATION) ensure that these and other coreference properties are respected: 1.,,

2 Preprocessing and Mention Extraction In our previous study CITATION we have shown that up to 35% recall and 20% precision errors in coreference resolution for MUC corpora are due to inaccurate mention detection.,,
We use the SVM-Light package CITATION for learning our classifiers.,,
