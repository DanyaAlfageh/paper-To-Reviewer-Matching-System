 2 Previous Work While self-training has worked in several domains, the early results on self-training for parsing were negative (CITATION; CITATION),,
 However more recent results have shown that it can indeed improve parser performance (CITATION; CITATIONa; CITATIONb),,

 Turning briefly to previous results on Medline data, the best comparative study of parsers is that of CITATION, which evaluates several statistical parsers,,
 This was on the Lease/Charniak (L/C) parser CITATION,,

 CITATION do not provide separate precision and recall numbers,,
 In contrast, the out-of-vocabulary rate of biomedical abstracts given the same lexicon is significantly higher at about 25% CITATION,,
 This second point is emphasized by the second paper on self-training for adaptation (CITATIONb),,

 CITATION achieve their results using small amounts of hand-annotated biomedical part-ofspeech-tagged data and also explore other possible sources or information,,

 So, for example, CITATIONa) found that the data from the handannotated WSJ data should be considered at least five times more important than NANC data on an event by event level,,
 The resulting parser was tested on a test corpus of hand-parsed sentences from the Genia Treebank CITATION,,
