So, for example, CITATIONa) found that the data from the handannotated WSJ data should be considered at least five times more important than NANC data on an event by event level,,
CITATION achieve their results using small amounts of hand-annotated biomedical part-ofspeech-tagged data and also explore other possible sources or information,,
However, several very good current parsers were not available when this paper was written (e.g., the Berkeley Parser CITATION),,
This was on the Lease/Charniak (L/C) parser CITATION.2 A close second (1% behind) was 1 This is not a criticism of the work,,
Turning briefly to previous results on Medline data, the best comparative study of parsers is that of CITATION, which evaluates several statistical parsers,,
This second point is emphasized by the second paper on self-training for adaptation (CITATIONb),,
2 This is the standard Charniak parser (without the parser of CITATION,,
 test corpus of hand-parsed sentences from the Genia Treebank CITATION,,
Section three describes our main experiment on standard test data CITATION,,
The resulting parser was tested on a test corpus of hand-parsed sentences from the Genia Treebank CITATION,,
CITATION do not provide separate precision and recall numbers,,
(2006) and CITATIONb),,
However more recent results have shown that it can indeed improve parser performance (CITATION; CITATIONa; CITATIONb),,
2 Previous Work While self-training has worked in several domains, the early results on self-training for parsing were negative (CITATION; CITATION),,
In contrast, the out-of-vocabulary rate of biomedical abstracts given the same lexicon is significantly higher at about 25% CITATION,,
Bacchiani and Roark train the Roark parser CITATION on trees from the Brown treebank and then self-train and test on data from Wall Street Journal,,
