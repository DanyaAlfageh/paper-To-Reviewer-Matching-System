 Under the maximum entropy framework CITATION, evidence from different features can be combined with no assumptions of feature independence,,
 In order to extract the linguistic features necessary for the model, all sentences were first automatically part-of-speech-tagged using a maximum entropy tagger CITATION and parsed using the Collins parser CITATION,,
 In addition, an automatic named entity tagger CITATION was run on the sentences to map proper nouns to a small set of semantic classes,,
 In order to extract the linguistic features necessary for the model, all sentences were first automatically part-of-speech-tagged using a maximum entropy tagger CITATION and parsed using the Collins parser CITATION,,
 In addition, an automatic named entity tagger CITATION was run on the sentences to map proper nouns to a small set of semantic classes,,
 This may be a language-dependent feature, as other experiments indicate that additional linguistic pre-processing does not necessarily improve tagging accuracy for languages like Chinese CITATION,,
 This occasionally resulted in minor revisions of the original groupings CITATION,,
 mantic links in WordNet CITATION, which can produce divergent dictionaries,,
 The lexical inventory used was the Hector lexicon, developed jointly by DEC and Oxford University Press CITATION,,
1 SENSEVAL-1 Results The maximum entropy WSD systems performance on the verbs from the evaluation data for SENSEVAL-1 CITATION rivaled that of the best-performing systems,,
 Methods of evaluation that automatically back off from synset to hypernyms CITATION would fail to credit the system for mistagging an instance with a closely related sense,,
 This occasionally resulted in minor revisions of the original groupings CITATION,,
 mantic links in WordNet CITATION, which can produce divergent dictionaries,,
 Previous experiments CITATION have explored the relative contribution of different knowledge sources to WSD and have concluded that collocational information is more important than syntactic information,,
 Additionally, Pedersen (CITATION; CITATION) has pursued the approach of using simple word bigrams and other linguistically impoverished feature sets for sense tagging, to establish upper bounds on the accuracy of feature sets that do not impose substantial pre-processing requirements,,
 They can lead to irrelevant document retrieval in IR systems, and inaccurate translations in Machine Translation systems CITATION,,

 Maximum entropy models have been applied to a wide range of classification tasks in NLP CITATION,,

 The system with the highest overall performance in SENSEVAL-1 used Yarowskys hierarchical decision lists CITATION; while there is a large set of potential features, only a small number is actually used to determine the sense of any given instance of a word,,
