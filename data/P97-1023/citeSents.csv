 1 Introduction The semantic orientation or polarity of a word indicates the direction the word deviates from the norm for its semantic group or lezical field CITATION,,
 It also constrains the word\'s usage in the language CITATION, due to its evaluative characteristics CITATION,,
 In linguistic constructs such as conjunctions, which impose constraints on the semantic orientation of their arguments (Anscombre and Ducrot, 1983; CITATION), the choices of arguments and connective are mutually constrained, as illustrated by: The tax proposal was simple and well-received } simplistic but well-received *simplistic and well-received by the public,,
 This is relevant to our task because semantic markedness exhibits a strong correlation with orientation, the unmarked member almost always having positive orientation (CITATION; CITATION),,
 3 Data Collection For our experiments, we use the 21 million word 1987 Wall Street Journal corpus4, automatically annotated with part-of-speech tags using the PARTS tagger CITATION,,

r model CITATION with a linear predictor = wWx where x is the vector of the observed counts in the various conjunction categories for the particular adjective pair we try to classify and w is a vector of weights to be learned during training,,
 Since using all the 42 independent predictors invites overfitting CITATION, we have investigated subsets of the full log-linear model for our data using the method of iterative stepwise refinement: starting with an initial model, variables are added or dropped if their contribution to the reduction or increase of the residual deviance compares favorably to the resulting loss or gain of residual degrees of freedom,,

 Unfortunately, dictionaries and similar sources (theusari, WordNet CITATION) do not include semantic orientation information,,
 Further analysis of different-orientation pairs in conjunctions other than but shows that conjoined antonyms are far more frequent than expected by chance, in agreement with CITATION,,

 These are typically members of groups of complementary, qualitative terms CITATION, e,,
 We improve the accuracy of classifying links derived from conjunctions as same or different orientation with a log-linear regression model CITATION, exploiting the differences between the various conjunction categories,,
 This is a generalized linear model CITATION with a linear predictor = wWx where x is the vector of the observed counts in the various conjunction categories for the particular adjective pair we try to classify and w is a vector of weights to be learned during training,,
