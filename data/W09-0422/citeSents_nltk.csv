4.1 Analysis Each sentence is tokenized (roughly according to the Penn Treebank conventions), tagged by the English version of the Morce tagger CITATION, and lemmatized by our lemmatizer,,
2.2 Parallel Data As the source of parallel data we use an internal release of Czech-English parallel corpus CzEng CITATION extended with some additional texts,,
During the analysis of the large Czech monolingual data, we used Jan Hajics Czech tagger shipped with PDT 2.0, Maximum Spanning Tree parser CITATION with optimized set of features as described in CITATION, and a tool for assigning functors (semantic roles) from CITATION, and numerous other components of our own (e.g,,
English sentences were analyzed using (among other tools) Morce tagger CITATION and Maximum Spanning Tree parser.2 The resulting deep syntactic (tectogrammatical) Czech and English trees are then aligned using Talignera feature based greedy algorithm implemented for this purpose CITATION,,

One of the steps in the analysis of English is named entity recognition using Stanford Named Entity Recognizer CITATION,,

The analysis was implemented using TectoMT, CITATION,,
1 Introduction We participated in WMT09 with two very different systems: (1) a phrase-based MT based on Moses CITATION and tuned for EnglishCzech translation, and (2) a complex system in the TectoMT platform CITATION,,

Note that automatic metrics are known to correlate quite poorly with human judgements, see the best ranking but lower scoring PC Translator this year and also in CITATION,,
Then the dependency parser CITATION is applied,,
English sentences were analyzed using (among other tools) Morce tagger CITATION and Maximum Spanning Tree parser.2 The resulting deep syntactic (tectogrammatical) Czech and English trees are then aligned us,,
3 Factored Phrase-Based MT We essentially repeat our experiments from last year CITATION: GIZA++ alignments4 on a-layer lemmas (a-layer nodes correspond 1-1 to surface tokens), symmetrized using grow-diag-final (no -and) heuristic5,,
It 2 In some previous experiments (e.g.CITATION), we used phrase-structure parser CITATION with subsequent constituency-dependency conversion,,
