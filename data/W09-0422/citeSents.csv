 3 Factored Phrase-Based MT We essentially repeat our experiments from last year CITATION: GIZA++ alignments4 on a-layer lemmas (a-layer nodes correspond 1-1 to surface tokens), symmetrized using grow-diag-final (no -and) heuristic5,,
2 Parallel Data As the source of parallel data we use an internal release of Czech-English parallel corpus CzEng CITATION extended with some additional texts,,
 Note that automatic metrics are known to correlate quite poorly with human judgements, see the best ranking but lower scoring PC Translator this year and also in CITATION,,
