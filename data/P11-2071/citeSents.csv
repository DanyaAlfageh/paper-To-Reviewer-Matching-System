 Finally, we assume access to a very small amount of parallel (labeled) target data, but only enough to evaluate on, or run weight tuning CITATION,,
 One of the first approaches essentially performs test-set relativization (choosing training samples that look most like the test data) to improve translation performance, but applies the approach only to very small data sets CITATION,,
 Later approaches are mostly based on a data set made available in the 2007 StatMT workshop CITATION, and have attempted to use monolingual (CITATION; CITATION) or comparable CITATION corpus resources,,

 Using an extension of a recent approach to mining translations from comparable corpora CITATION, we are able to find translations for otherwise OOV terms,,
 In this paper, we consider one specific aspect of domain divergence (CITATION; ,,
 4 Dictionary Mining Our dictionary mining approach is based on Canonical Correlation Analysis, as used previously by CITATION,,
 Briefly, given a multi-view data set, Canonical Correlation Analysis is a technique to find the projection directions in each view so that the objects when projected along these di408 \x0crections are maximally aligned CITATION,,

 Here we describe the use of CCA to find the translations for the OOV German words CITATION,,
 In this paper, we consider one specific aspect of domain divergence (CITATION; Blitzer and Daume III, 2010): the out-of-vocabulary problem,,
 We then run Hungarian algorithm to extract maximum weighted bipartite matching CITATION,,

 Finally, we assume access to a very small amount of parallel (labeled) target data, but only enough to evaluate on, or run weight tuning CITATION,,
 In all cases we perform parameter tuning with MERT CITATION, and results are averaged over three runs with different random initializations,,
