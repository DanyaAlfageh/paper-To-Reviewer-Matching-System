 In the following example CITATION, the fact that dog, rather than prize, is often the subject of run, can be used to decide on the attachment site of the relative clause: Fred awarded a prize for the dog that ran the fastest We describe a proposal for acquiring such knowledge, and as in other recent work in this area (CITATION; CITATION), a probabilistic approach is taken,,
 Using probabilities accords with the intuition that there are no absolute constraints on the arguments of predicates, but rather that constraints are satis\x0ced to a certain degree CITATION,,

 The log-likelihood \x1f2 statistic is used rather than the Pearson's \x1f2 statistic because it is thought to be more appropriate when the counts in the contingency table are low CITATION,,
 The problem of choosing an appropriate level in the hierarchy at which to represent a particular noun sense (given a predicate and argument position) has been investigated by CITATION, Li and Abe CITATION and CITATION,,
