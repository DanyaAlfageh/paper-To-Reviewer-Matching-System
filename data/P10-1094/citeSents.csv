CITATION use the information redundancy in multilingual input to correct errors in machine translation and thus improve the quality of multilingual summaries,,
Topic-focused or query biased multi-document summarization has also been investigated CITATION,,
In the experiments, we use the LIBSVM tool CITATION with the RBF kernel for the task, and we use the parameter selection tool of 10-fold cross validation via grid search to find the best parameters on the training set with respect to mean squared error (MSE), and then use the best parameters to train on the whole training set,,

CITATION investigate the possibility of evaluating MT quality and fluency at the sentence level,,
CITATION use machin,,
For multi-document summarization, some sentences are highly overlapping with each other, and thus we apply the same greedy algorithm in CITATION to penalize the sentences highly overlapping with other highly scored sentences, and finally the informative, novel, and easy-to-translate sentences are chosen into the English summary,,
t summarization, the centroid-based method CITATION is a typical method, and it scores sentences based on cluster centroids, position and TFIDF features,,
