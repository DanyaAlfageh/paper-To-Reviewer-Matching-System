The vector measure CITATION creates a co occurrence matrix from a corpus made up of the WordNet glosses,,
Similar to Kleinbergs HITS algorithm CITATION or Googles PageRank CITATION, these methods first build a graph based on the similarity between sentences in a document and then the importance of a sentence is determined by taking into account global information on the graph recurs,,
We used the ROUGE CITATION toolkit (i.e.ROUGEeval-1.4.2 in this study) for evaluation, which has been widely adopted by DUC for automatic summarization evaluation,,
measure CITATION creates a co occurrence matrix from a corpus made up of the WordNet glosses,,
The scores are usually computed based on a combination of statistical and linguistic features, including term frequency, sentence position, cue words, stigma words, topic signature (CITATION; CITATION), etc,,
More recently, CITATION propose the TextRank model to rank keywords based on the co-occurrence links between words,,
CITATION use heuristics to extract keyphrases from a document,,

Most recently, graph-based ranking methods, including TextRank ((CITATION, 2005) and LexPageRank CITATION have been proposed for document summarization,,
In CITATION, the mutual reinforcement principle is employed to iteratively extract key phrases and sentences from a document,,
More linguistic knowledge (such as syntactic features) has been explored by CITATION,,
CITATION uses an unsupervised learning algorithm to discover two-word keyphrases,,
GenEx CITATION and Kea,,
Similar to Kleinbergs HITS algorithm CITATION or Googles PageRank CITATION, these methods first build a graph based on the similarity between sentences in a document and then the importance of a sentence is determined by taking into account global information on the graph recursively, rather than relying only on local sentence-specific information,,
MutualRank is proposed in CITATION to make use of only the sentence-to-word relationships to rank sentences and words,,
WordNet CITATION is a lexical database where each 1 The stopwords defined in the Smart system have been removed from the collection,,
CITATION proposes a method for simultaneous keyphrase extraction and text summarization by using only the heterogeneous sentence-to-word relationships,,
GenEx CITATION and Kea (CITATION; CITATION) are two typical systems, and the most important features for classifying a candidate phrase are the frequency and location of the phrase in the document,,
Machine learning methods have also been employed to extract sentences, including unsupervised methods CITATION and supervised methods (CITATION; CITATION; CITATION; CITATION),,
More recently, CITATION propose the TextRank model to rank keywords based on ,,
In recent years, graph-based ranking algorithms have been successfully used for document summarization (CITATION, 2005; CITATION) and keyword extraction CITATION,,
Similar to Kleinbergs HITS algorithm CITATION or Googles PageRank CITATION, these methods first build a graph based on the ,,
Among these different scores, unigram-based ROUGE score (ROUGE-1) has been shown to agree with human judgment most CITATION,,
