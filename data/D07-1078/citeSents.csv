5 Extracting translation rules from (e-forest, f, a)-tuples The algorithm to extract rules from (e-forest, f, a)- tuples is a natural generalization of the (e-parse, f, a)-based rule extraction algorithm in CITATION,,
The output of the algorithm is a derivation forest CITATION composed of xRs rules,,
We extract rules rooted at it using the procedure in CITATION, forming multiplicative derivation forest nodes, i.e., (NPB(NNP1 NPB(NNP2 : x0 NPB : x1)) x0 x1 x2) We then go to condition 1 to form the derivation forest on the additive frontier e-forest nodes of the newly extracted rules, generating additive derivation forest nodes, i.e., (NNP1), (NNP2) and (NPB),,
This algorithm is a natural extension of the extraction algorithm in CITATION in the sense that we have an extra condition (1) to relay rule extraction on additive e-forest nodes,,
We extract rules from (, f, a), generating a translation model consisting of parameters (i.e., rule eparse CITATION composed rule extraction 1 2 parallel binarization eforest forestbased rule extraction of minimal rules f,a synchronous derivation forests EM 3 4 viterbi derivations project eparse model syntax translation Figure 5: Using the EM algorithm to choose restructuring,,

In CITATION, a composed rule is extracted only if the number of internal nodes it contains does not exceed a limit (i.e., 4), similar to the phrase length limit in phrase-based systems,,
