The output of the algorithm is a derivation forest CITATION composed of xRs rules,,
That is p(, f, a) = X Y r p(r) (2) Since it has been well-known that applying EM with tree fragments of different sizes causes overfitting CITATION, and since it is also known that syntax MT models with larger composed rules in the mix significantly outperform rules that minimally explain the training data (minimal rules) in 751 \x0ctranslation accuracy CITATION, we decompose p(b, f, a) using minimal rules during running of the EM algorithm, but, after the EM restructuring is finished, we build the final translation model using composed rules for eval,,
We also computed the bootstrap p-values CITATION for the pairwise BLEU comparison between the baseline system and any of the system trained from binarized trees,,
In CITATION, a composed rule is extracted only if the number of internal nodes it contains do,,
tore all the binarizations that operate on an e-parse in a compact way, and then use the inside-outside algorithm (CITATION; CITATION) for model estimation,,
It can be further computed by aggregating the rule probabilities p(r) in each derivation in the set of all derivations (CITATION; CITATION),,
Binarizing the syntax trees for syntax-based machine translation is similar in spirit to generalizing parsing models via markovization (CITATION; CITATION),,
We used the rule extractor described in CITATION to extract rules from (e-parse, f, a)-tuples, but we made an important modification: new nodes introduced by binarization will not be counted when computing the rule size limit unless they appear as the rule roots,,
This algorithm is a natural extension of the extraction algorithm in CITATION in the sense that we have an extra condition (1) to relay rule extraction on additive e-forest nodes,,
We used a bottom-up, CKY-style decoder that works with binary xRs rules obtained via a synchronous binarization procedure CITATION,,
In CITATION, a composed rule is extracted only if the number of internal nodes it contains does not exceed a limit (i.e., 4), similar to the phrase length limit in phrase-based systems,,
For example, suppose we have an xRs CITATION rule R1 in Figure 1 that translates,,
We extract rules rooted at it using the procedure in CITATION, forming multiplicative derivation forest nodes, i.e., (NPB(NNP1 NPB(NNP2 : x0 NPB : x1)) x0 x1 x2) We then go to condition 1 to form the derivation forest on the additive frontier e-forest nodes of the newly extracted rules, generating additive derivation forest nodes, i.e., (NNP1), (NNP2) and (NPB),,
We used the rule extractor described in CITATION to extract rules from (e-parse, f, a)-tuples, but we made an important modification: new nodes introduced by binarization,,
1 Introduction Syntax-based translation models (CITATION; CITATION; CITATION) are usually built directly from Penn Treebank (PTB) CITATION style parse trees by composing treebank grammar rules,,
In CITATION, a composed rule,,
Such a tuple is called an alignment graph in CITATION,,
That is p(, f, a) = X Y r p(r) (2) Since it has been well-known that applying EM with tree fragments of different sizes causes overfitting CITATION, and since it is also known that syntax MT models with larger composed rules in the mix significantly outperform rules t,,
We therefore use the packed forest to store all the binarizations that operate on an e-parse in a compact way, and then use the inside-outside algorithm (CITATION; CITATION) for model estimation,,
5 Extracting translation rules from (e-forest, f, a)-tuples The algorithm to extract rules from (e-forest, f, a)- tuples is a natural generalization of the (e-parse, f, a)-based rule extraction algorithm in CITATION,,
For example, suppose we have an xRs CITATION rule R1 in Figure 1 that translates the Chinese phrase R,,
We extract rules from (, f, a), generating a translation model consisting of parameters (i.e., rule eparse CITATION composed rule extraction 1 2 parallel binarization eforest forestbased rule extraction of minimal rules f,a synchronous derivation forests EM 3 4 viterbi derivations project eparse model syntax translation Figure 5: Using the EM algorithm to choose restructuring,,
We used the rule extractor described in CITATION to extract rules from (e-parse, f, a)-tuples, but we made an important modification: new nodes introduced by binarization will not be counted when computing the rule size limit unless they appear a,,
For example, suppose we have an xRs CITATION rule R1 in Figure 1 that translates the Chinese phrase RUSSIA MINISTER VIKTOR,,
The translation model we are using in this paper belongs to the xRs formalism CITATION, which has been proved successful for machine translation in (CITATION; CITATION; CITATION),,
That is p(, f, a) = X Y r p(r) (2) Since it has been well-known that applying EM with tree fragments of different sizes causes overfitting CITATION, and since it is also known that syntax MT models with larger composed rules in the mix significantly outperform rules that minimally explain the training data (minimal rules) in 751 \x0ctranslation accuracy CITATION, we decompose p(b, f, a) using minimal rules during running of the EM algorithm, but, after the EM restructuring is finished, we build the final translation model using composed rules for evaluation,,
For example, suppose we have an xRs CITATION rule R1 in Figure 1 that translates the Chinese phrase RUSSIA MINISTER VIKTOR-CHERNOMYRDIN into an English NPB tree fragment yielding an English phrase,,
Borrowing terms from parsing semirings CITATION, a packed forest is composed of additive forest nodes (-nodes) and multiplicative forest nodes (-nodes),,
The parse trees on the English side of the bitexts were generated using a parser CITATION implementing the Collins parsing models CITATION,,
That is p(, f, a) = X Y r p(r) (2) Since it has been well-known that applying EM with tree fragments of different sizes causes overfitting CITATION, and since it is also known that syntax MT models with larger composed rules in the mix significantly outperform rules that minimally explain the ,,
