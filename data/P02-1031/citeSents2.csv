CITATION describe a statistical system trained on the data from the FrameNet project to automatically assign semantic roles,,
3 The Experiments In previous work using the FrameNet corpus, CITATION developed a system to predict semantic roles from sentences and their parse trees as determined by the statistical parser of CITATION,,
