 5 Conclusion Our chunk-based system takes the last word of the chunk as its head word for the purposes of predicting roles, but does not make use of the identities of the chunk\'s other words or the intervening words between a chunk and the predicate, unlike Hidden Markov Model-like systems such as CITATION, CITATION and La\x0berty et al,,
 In this paper, we examine how the information provided by modern statistical parsers such as CITATION and CITATION contributes to solving this problem,,

 3 The Experiments In previous work using the FrameNet corpus, CITATION developed a system to predict semantic roles from sentences and their parse trees as determined by the statistical parser of CITATION,,
 FrameNet is focused on semantic frames, which are de\x0cned as schematic representation of situations involving various participants, props, and other conceptual roles CITATION,,

 Our chunks were derived from the Treebank trees using the conversion described by Tjong Kim CITATION,,
