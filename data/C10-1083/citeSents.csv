Different from some existing work on exploiting ontologies, e.g., CITATION, which relies on training data, we focus on exploring unsupervised approaches, which can be applied to a larger scope of topics,,

the major opinions in our opinion set DT ? Aspect Ordering: How can we order a subset of selected aspects A0 so as to present them in an order (A0) that is most natural with respect to human perception? New Aspects Suggestion: Can we exploit the opinions in DT to suggest new aspects to be added to the ontology? 3.1 Aspect Selection In order to align the scattered opinions to the most relevant aspects, we first use each aspect label Ai A as a query to retrieve a set of relevant opinions in the collection Si DT with a standard language modeling approach, i.e., the KL-divergence retrieval model CITATION,,
