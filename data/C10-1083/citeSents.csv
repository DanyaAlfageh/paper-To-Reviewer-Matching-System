 However, CITATION assumes the well-written article is structured with explicit or implicit aspect information, which does not always hold in practice, while CITATION needs a relatively large amount of training data in the given domain,,
 Although aspects selected in this way can effectively capture the major opinions, a major limitation is that it is generally hard to ensure that the selected phrases are well connected with the given topic CITATION,,
