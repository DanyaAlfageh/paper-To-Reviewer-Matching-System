In this paper, we employ an SVM-based NER method in the following way that showed good NER performance in Japanese CITATION,,
On the other hand, in text-based NER, better results are obtained using discriminative schemes such as maximum entropy (ME) models (CITATION; CITATION), support vector machines (SVMs) CITATION, and conditional random fields (CRFs) CITATION,,
Many discriminative methods have been applied to NER, such as decision trees CITATION, ME models (CITATION; CITATION), and CRFs CITATION,,
CITATION applied a text-level ME-based NER to ASR results,,
Most previous studies of the NER of speech data used generative models such as hidden Markov models (HMMs) (CITATION; CITATION; CITATIONb; CITATION; CITATION),,
