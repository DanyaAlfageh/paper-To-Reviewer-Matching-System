5 We use WordNet CITATION for word lemmatization,,
We use Stanford named entity recognizer7 to extract named entities from the texts CITATION,,
To validate this, we then perform keyword extraction by using a simple TFIDF based approach, which has been shown effective for keyword or keyphrase extraction from the texts (CITATION; CITATION; CITATION),,

The algorithm of parallel phrase extraction, which develops the approached presented in CITATION, uses lexical overlap and structural matching measures CITATION,,
Therefore, there has been very little literature discussing the characteristics of comparable corpora CITATION,,
Some studies (CITATION; CITATION; McEnery and Xiao, 2007) analyse comparability by assessing corpus composition, such as structural criteria (e.g., format and size), and linguistic criteria (e.g., topic, domain, and genre),,
CITATION measure similarity and homogeneity between monolingual corpora,,

CITATION; 2006) select more comparable document pairs in a cross-lingual information retrieval based manner by using a toolkit called Lemur1,,
CITATION treat Wikipedia as a comparable corpus and use interwiki links to identify aligned comparable document pairs for the task of parallel sentence extraction,,
CITATION propose a comparability metric which can be applied at both document level and corpus level and use it as a measure to select more comparable texts from other external sources into the original corpora for bilingual lexicon extraction,,
