Finally, Brants CITATION described a German chunker which was implemented with cascaded Markov Models,,
rammar is de\x0cned according to Abney\'s chunk style CITATION who describes chunks as syntactic units which correspond in some way to prosodic patterns, containing a content word surrounded by some function word(s): all words from the beginning of the noun phrase to the head noun are included.3 The di\x0berent kinds of noun chunks covered by our grammar are listed below and illustrated with examples: \x0f a combination of a non-obligatory determiner, optional adjectives or cardinals and the noun 1Other types of lexicalised PCFGs have been described in CITATION, CITATION, CITATION, CITATION and CITATION,,

Church\'s noun phrase tagger CITATION, one of the \x0crst noun chunkers, was based on a Hidden Markov Model (HMM) similar to those used \x03 Thanks to Mats Rooth and Uli Heid for many helpful comments,,
The structural noun chunk concept in the grammar is de\x0cned according to Abney\'s chunk style CITATION who describes chunks as syntactic units which correspond in some way to prosodic patterns, containing a content word surrounded by some function word(s): all words from the beginning of the noun phrase to the head noun are included.3 The di\x0berent kinds of noun chunks covered by our grammar are listed below and illustrated with examples: \x0f a combination of a non-obligatory determiner, optional adjectives or cardinals and the noun 1Other types of lexicalised PCFGs have been described in CITATION, CITATION, CITATION, CITATION and (Eisner and Satta, 1,,

Head-lexicalised probabilistic context-free grammars (H-L PCFG) CITATION extend the PCFG approach by incorporating information about the lexical head of constituents into the probabilistic model.1 Each node in a parse of a HL PCFG is labelled with a category and the lexical head of the category,,
The second type of robustnessrules, called trigram rules CITATION is more context sensitive,,
The absolute discounting method CITATION was adapted to fractional counts for this purpose,,
the subcategorisation of verbs (see CITATION),,

Ramshaw and Marcus CITATION successfully applied Eric Brill\',,
Ramshaw and Marcus CITATION successfully applied Eric Brill\'s transformation-based learning method to the chunking problem,,
Abney\'s cascaded \x0cnitestate parser CITATION also contains a processing step which recognises noun chunks and other types of chunks,,
Another HMM-based approach has been developed by Mats Rooth CITATION,,
3 Chunking A head-lexicalised probabilistic context-free parser, called LoPar CITATION, was used for parsing,,
Voutilainen\'s NPtool CITATION is based on his constraint-grammar system,,
