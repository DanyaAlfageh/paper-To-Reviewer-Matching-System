 The structural noun chunk concept in the grammar is de\x0cned according to Abney\'s chunk style CITATION who describes chunks as syntactic units which correspond in some way to prosodic patterns, containing a content word surrounded by some function word(s): all words from the beginning of the noun phrase to the head noun are included,,
