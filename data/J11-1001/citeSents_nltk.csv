ROUGE CITATION compares any summary to any other (typically human-generated) summary using a recall-oriented approach,,
Table 1 gives average ROUGE-2 scores and 95% confidence intervals, computed via bootstrapping CITATION, over the 48 document sets,,
After evaluating data from 2005 2007 (CITATION; CITATION), NIST decided that this score, which evaluates summary usefulness including linguistic quality, is a reliable and stable manual evaluation,,
This has also been observed in previous summarization evaluations CITATION,,
The pyramid method CITATION is a content-based metric for which human annotators mark content units in the human-generated summaries,,
4.2 Validation Using Bootstrapping Experiments To show that our results are not due to a lucky partitioning of the data, we used bootstrapping CITATION, a resampling method, which allows us to compute our statistical confidence in the results,,
