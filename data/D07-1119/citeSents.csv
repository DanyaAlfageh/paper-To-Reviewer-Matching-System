 2 Multilingual Track The overall parsing algorithm is a deterministic classifier-based statistical parser, which extends the approach by Yamada and Matsumoto CITATION, by using different reduction rules that ensure deterministic incremental processing of the input sentence and by adding specific rules for handling non-projective dependencies,,
 The submitted runs used a second order Average Perceptron, derived from the multiclass perceptron of Crammer and Singer CITATION,,
 We obtained the best accuracy with a multiclass averaged perceptron classifier based on the ultraconservative formulation of Crammer and Singer CITATION with uniform negative updates,,

 No preprocessing or post-processing was used, except stemming for English, by means of the Snowball stemmer CITATION,,
 3 Deterministic Classifier-based Parsing DeSR CITATION is an incremental deterministic classifier-based parser,,
 4 Non-Projective Relations For handling non-projective relations, CITATION suggested applying a preprocessing step to a dependency parser, which consists in lifting non-projective arcs to their head repeatedly, until the tree becomes pseudo-projective,,
 In DeSR non-projective dependencies are handled in a single step by means of the following additional parsing rules, slightly different from those in CITATION: s1|s2|S, n|I, T, A Right2d S, s1|n|I, T, A{(s2, d, n)} s1|s2|S, n|I, T, A Left2d s2|S, s1|I, T, A{(n, d, s2)} s1|s2|s3|S, n|I, T, A Right3d S, s1|s2|n|I, T, A{(s3, d, n)} s1|s2|s3|S, n|I, T, A Left3d s2|s3|S, s1|I, T, A{(n, d, s3)} s1|s2|S, n|I, T, A Extract n|s1|S, I, s2|T, A S, I, s1|T, A Insert s1|S, I, T, A Left2, Right2 are similar to Left and Right, except that they create links crossing one intermediate node, while Left3 and Right3 cross two intermediate nodes,,
 We then used a parsing revision technique CITATION to learn how to correct these errors, producing a parse reviser called DesrReviser,,

 This consists of WSJ sections 02-11, half of the usual set 02-23, for a total of 460,000 tokens with dependencies generated with the converter by CITATION,,
 By visual inspection using DgAnnotator CITATION, the parses looked generally correct,,
 unlab1 was tokenized, POS and lemmas were added using our version of TreeTagger CITATION, and lemmas replaced with stems, which had turned out to be more effective than lemmas,,
