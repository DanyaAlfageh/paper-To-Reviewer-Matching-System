 This section describes experiments using the machine learning program RIPPER CITATION to automatically induce prediction models from our data,,
 In particular, we found that prosodic features, in combination with other information already available to the recognizer, can distinguish user turns that are misrecognized by the system far better than traditional methods used in ASR rejection (CITATION; CITATION),,

 We represent each user turn using the feature set shown in Figure 2, which we previously found useful for predicting corrections CITATION,,
 Finally, given that our previous studies showed that preceding dialogue context may affect correction behavior (CITATION; CITATION), we included a feature (diadist) reflecting the distance of the current turn from the beginning of the dialogue, and a set of features summarizing aspects of the prior dialogue: for the latter features, we included both the number of times prior turns exhibited certain characteristics (e,,
 In this way, they are similar to what others have termed go-back signals CITATION,,
