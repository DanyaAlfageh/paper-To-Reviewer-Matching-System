In Cross-Language Information Retrieval (CLIR) systems, they play an even more important role as the accuracy of their transliterations is shown to correlate highly with the performance of the CLIR systems (CITATION, CITATION),,
Machine Transliteration systems (AbdulJaleel and Larkey, 2003; CITATION; CITATION) usually produce incorrect transliterations and translation lexcions such as hand-crafted or statistical dictionaries are too static to have good coverage of NEs1 occurring in the current news events,,

NETE discovery from comparable corpora using time series and transliteration model was proposed in CITATION, and extended for NETE mining,,
Although the coverage of the dictionaries was low, this turned out to be not a serious issue for our cross-language document similarity model as it might have for topic based CLIR CITATION,,
Further, we smoothed the document probability distributions with collection frequency as described in CITATION,,
