NETE discovery from comparable corpora using time series and transliteration model was proposed in CITATION, and extended for NETE mining for several languages in (Saravanan ,,
Machine Transliteration systems (AbdulJaleel and Larkey, 2003; CITATION; CITATION) usually produce incorrect transliterations and translation lexcions such as hand-crafted or statistical dictionaries are too static to have good coverage of NEs1 occurring in the current news events,,
In order to address this problem, different kinds of approaches have been taken, from learning transformation rules from dictionaries and applying the rules to find cross-lingual spelling variants CITATION, to learning translation lexicon from monolingual and/or comparable corpora (CITATION; CITATION; CITATION; CITATION),,
NETE discovery from comparable corpora using time series and transliteration model was proposed in CITATION, and extended for NETE mining,,
NETE discovery from comparable corpora using time series and transliteration model was proposed in CITATION,,,
(CITATION; CITATION) addresses mining of parallel sentences and fragments from nearly parallel sentences,,
NETE discovery from comparable corpora using time series and transliteration model was proposed in CITATION, and extended for NETE mining for several languages in (Saravanan and Kumaran, 2007),,
The emission probability depends on the current source character and the previous target character unlike the W-HMM model CITATION,,
NETE mining from comparable corpora using phonetic mappings was proposed in CITATION, but the need for language specific knowledge restricts its applicability across languages,,
News stories are typically rich in NEs and therefore, comparable news corpora can be expected to contain NETEs (CITATION; CITATION),,
ed in several works (CITATION; CITATION),,
We proposed the idea of mining NETEs from multilingual articles with similar content in CITATION,,
In order to compare the effectiveness of MINT with a state-of-the-art NETE mining approach, we implemented the time series based Co-Ranking algorithm based on CITATION,,
In addition, CITATION may not scale,,

Further, we smoothed the document probability distributions with collection frequency as described in CITATION,,
The limited coverage of dictionaries has been recognized as a problem in CLIR and MT (CITATION; Mandl & Womser-hacker, 2005; Xu &Weischedel, 2005),,
We show that MINTs performance is significantly better than a state of the art method CITATION,,
hough the coverage of the dictionaries was low, this turned out to be not a serious issue for our cross-language document similarity model as it might have for topic based CLIR CITATION,,
Our contributions are as follows: We give empirical evidence for the hypothesis that news articles in different languages with reasonably similar content are rich sources of NETEs CITATION,,
In Cross-Language Information Retrieval (CLIR) systems, they play an even more important role as the accuracy of their transliterations is shown to correlate highly with the performance of the CLIR systems (CITATION, CITATION),,
Although the coverage of the dictionaries was low, this turned out to be not a serious issue for our cross-language document similarity model as it might have for topic based CLIR CITATION,,
uages with reasonably similar content are rich sources of NETEs CITATION,,
In addition, CITATION may not scale for large corpora, as they examine every word in the target side as a potential transliteration equivalent,,
