Extracting information from tables has been discussed by different communities in the last decade, including NLP (CITATION; CITATION; CITATION), artificial intelligence (CITATION; CITATION), information retrieval (CITATION; CITATION), database CITATION, and the web CITATION.,,

3.3 Shallow vs. Linguistic Features We validate the hypothesis that using linguistic features, e.g., part-of-speech tags CITATION, named-entity tags CITATION, and dependency trees (de Marneffe et al., 2006), helps improve the quality of our approach, called Joint.,,

Most previous approaches use textual or tabular features separately, e.g., tabular approaches that do not use text features (CITATION; CITATION; CITATION) or textual approaches that do not use tabular features (CITATION; CITATION; CITATION).,,
In a prescient study, CITATION proposed to learn the target relation independently from both table and surface textual features, and then combine the result using a linear combination of the predictions.,,

This approach follows CITATION and CITATION and only uses the tables in a document.,,
This approach only has access to the text in a document and contains all the features mentioned in CITATION and CITATION.,,
In both Table and Text, we use a conditional random field CITATION model for the Rock-TotalOrganicCarbon relation.,,
Following CITATION, we combine these two probabilities using a linear combination.,,
