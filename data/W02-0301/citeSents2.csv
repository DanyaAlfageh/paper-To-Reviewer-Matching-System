Support Vector Machines (SVMs) CITATION and Maximum Entropy (ME) method CITATION are powerful learning methods that satisfy such requirements, and are applied successfully to other NLP tasks (CITATION; CITATION; CITATION),,
We use the maximum entropy tagging method described in CITATION for the experiments, which is a variant of CITATION modified to use HMM state features,,
Another reason for low accuracies is that biomedical named entities are essentially hard to recognize using standard feature sets compared with the named entities in newswire articles CITATION,,
Although there is a previous work that applied SVMs to biomedical named entity task in this formulation CITATION, their method,,
