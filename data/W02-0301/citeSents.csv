It is also reported that the pairwise method achieves higher accuracy than other methods in some benchmarks (CITATION; CITATION),,
Because the SVM training is a quadratic optimization program, its cost is super-linear to the size of the training samples even with the tailored techniques such as SMO CITATION and kernel evaluation caching CITATION,,
CITATION proposed to use as features the Viterbi state sequence of a hidden Markov model (HMM) to prevent the data sparseness problem in the maximum entropy tagging model,,
Although there is a previous work that applied SVMs to biomedical named entity task in this formulation CITATION, their method,,
However, although a method to convert the outputs of a binary SVM to probabilistic values is proposed CITATION, the way to obtain meaningful probabilistic values needed in Viterbitype algorithms from the outputs of a multi-class SVM is unknown,,
overcome such a situation, the GENIA corpus CITATION has been developed, and at this time it is the largest biomedical annotated corpus available to public, containing 670 annotated abstracts of the MEDLINE database,,
Machine learning approach has been applied to biomedical named entity recognition (CITATION; CITATION; CITATION; CITATION),,
Support Vector Machines (SVMs) CITATION and Maximum Entropy (ME) method CITATION are powerful learning methods that satisfy such requirements, and are applied successfully to other NLP tasks (CITATION; CITATION; CITATION),,
Among several methods for constructing a multi-class SVM CITATION, we use a pairwise method proposed by CITATION instead of the one-vs-rest method used in CITATION, and extend the BIO representation to enable the training with the entire GENIA corpus,,
Even with a more feasible method, pairwise CITATION, which is employed in CITATION, we cannot train a classifier in a reasonable time, because we have a large number of samples that belong to the non-entity class in this formulation,,
A polynomial function defined as (sxi xj + r)d is popular in applications of SVMs to NLPs (CITATION; CITATION; CITATION), because it has an intuitively sound interpretation that each dimension of the mapped space is a 3 For many real-world problems where the samples may be inseparable, we allow the constraints are broken with some penalty,,
We have implemented SMO algorithm CITATION and techniques described in CITATION for soft margin SVMs in C++ programming language, and implemented support codes for pairwise classification and parallel training in Java programming language,,
Another reason for low accuracies is that biomedical named entities are essentially hard to recognize using standard feature sets compared with the named entities in newswire articles CITATION,,
To obtain POS information required for features and class splitting, we used an English POS tagger described in CITATION,,
Support Vector Machines (SVMs) CITATION and Maximum Entropy (ME) method (Berger et al., 1,,
a et al., 2001; CITATION),,
1 Available via http://www-tsujii.is.s.u-tokyo.ac.jp/GENIA/ 2 The GENIA corpus also has annotations for conjunctive/disjunctive named entity expressions such as human B- or T-cell lines CITATION,,
Since it is practically impossible for a researcher to grasp all of the huge amount of knowledge provided in the form of natural language, e.g., journal papers, there is a strong demand for biomedical information extraction (IE), which extracts knowledge automatically from biomedical papers using NLP techniques (CITATION; CITATION; CITATION),,
We use the maximum entropy tagging method described in CITATION for the experiments, which is a variant of CITATION modified to use HMM state features,,
In this paper, we employ the simplest BIO representation, which is also used in CITATION,,
Although there is a previous work that applied SVMs to biomedical named entity task in this formulation CITATION, their method to construct a classifier using SVMs, one-vs-rest, fails to train a classifier with entire GENIA corpus, since the cost of SVM training is super-linear to the size of training samples,,
To overcome such a situation, the GENIA corpus CITATION has been devel,,
Fortunately, we can stop classifications when a class gets K 1 votes and this stopping greatly saves classification time CITATION,,
CITATION and Collier et al,,
Several representations to encode region information are proposed and examined (CITATION; CITATION; CITATION),,
To overcome such a situation, the GENIA corpus CITATION has been developed, and at this time it is the largest biomedical annotated corpus available to public, containing 670 annotated abstracts of the MEDLINE database,,
ada et al., 2000; CITATION),,
The compared system is a maximum entropy tagging model described in CITATION,,
The vocabulary for the word feature is constructed by taking the most frequent 10,000 words from the above raw abstracts, the prefix/suffix/prefix list by taking the most frequent 10,000 prefixes/suffixes/substrings.8 The performance is measured by precision, recall, and F-score, which are the standard measures for the 6 Randomly selected set used in CITATION,,
3.2 Support Vector Machines Support Vector Machines (SVMs) CITATION are powerful methods for learning a classifier, which have been applied successfully to many NLP tasks such as base phrase chunking CITATION and part-of-speech tagging CITATION,,
