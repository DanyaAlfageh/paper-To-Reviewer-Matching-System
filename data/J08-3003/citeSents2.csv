For the probability model, we adopt the approach by CITATION, which itself is a modified version of the statistical model used in CITATION.8 In this model in Equation (2), the probability of a dependency link P(dep (ui, uH(i)) |S) linking ui to a head uH(i) is approximated with the product of two probabilities: P(dep (ui, uH(i)) |S) P(link(ui, uH(i)) |i H(i)) (2) P(ui links to some head dist(i, H(i)) away |i) 7 The rules check for enclitics such as de, ki, mi, written on the right side of and separately from the word they attach to, for the verb degil, which gives a negative meaning to the word coming before it and for nominals which do not have any verbs on their right side,,
A conditional probability model to score the analyses CITATION Table 1 Unlabeled attachment scores and unlabeled word-to-word scores for the baseline parsers,,
In all of the following models, dist(i, H(i)) is taken as the number of actual word boundaries between the dependent and the head unit regardless of whether full words or IGs were used as units of parsing.9 To alleviate the data sparseness, we use the interpolation of other estimates while calculating the probabilities in Equation (2).10 We use a strategy similar to CITATION and we interpolate with estimates based on less context: P(x|y) P1(x|y) + (1 ) P2(x) (3) where = /( + 1) and is the count of the x occurrences During the actual runs, the smoothed probability P(link(ui, uH(i)) |i H(i)) is estimated by interpolating two unsmoothed empirical estimates extracted from the treebank: P1(link(ui, uH(i)) |i H(i)) and P2(link(ui, uH(i))),,
Maximum likelihood estimation to make inferences about the underlying probability models (CITATION; CITATION) 4.1 Methodology The aim of our probabilistic model is to assign a probability to each candidate dependency link by using the frequencies of similar dependencies computed from a training set,,
