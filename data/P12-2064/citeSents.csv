More specifically, it is shown by cross validation that meta-learning performs at a level that is comparable to the best base classifier CITATION,,
We use the Stanford coreNLP toolkit1 (CITATION; CITATIONa; CITATIONb; CITATION) to extract the features,,
For example, CITATION proposed a method that combines a native corpus and a GE tagged learner corpus and it outperformed models trained with either a native or GE tagged learner corpus alone,,
Recently, a group of researchers introduced methods utilizing a GE tagged learner corpus to derive more accurate results (CITATION; CITATION),,
We followed the structural learning approach CITATION, which trains a model from both a native corpus and a GE tagged corpus (Dahlmeire and Ng, 2011), to improve the base classifiers by the additional information extracted from a native corpus,,
Some researchers focused on mining better features from the linguistic and pedagogic knowledge, whereas others focused on testing different classification methods (Knight and Chandler, 1994; CITATION; CITATION; CITATION; CITATION; De Felice, 2008),,
Normally, different classifiers successfully predict results on different parts of the input space, so researchers have often tried to combine different classifiers together (CITATION; CITATION; CITATION; Aydn, 2009; CITATION),,
