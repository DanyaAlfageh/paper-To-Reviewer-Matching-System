CITATION building on earlier work on blog search CITATION proposed a probabilistic IR approach which ranks user forum threads relative to selected posts in the overall thread, and again demonstrated the superiority of this method over a model which ignores thread structure,,
There is some contention about the import of context in DA classification, with the prevailing view being that context aids classification (CITATION; CITATION; CITATION), but also evidence to suggest that strictly local modelling is superior (CITATION; Serafin and Di Eugenio, 2004),,
We also POS tagged and lemmatised the posts, postfixing the lemmatised token with its POS tag (using Lingua::EN::Tagger and morpha CITATION),,
Disentanglement has been carried out via analysis of direct citation/user name references (Schuth et al., 2007; CITATION), topic modelling CITATION, and clustering over content-based features for pairs of posts, optionally incorporating various constraints on post recency (Elsner and Charniak, 2008; CITATION; CITATION),,

Combining this with profiling of the cross-thread behaviour of individual forum participants (CITATION; CITATION), and formal modelling of forum behaviour is also a promising line of research, taking the lead from the work of CITATION, inter alia,,
