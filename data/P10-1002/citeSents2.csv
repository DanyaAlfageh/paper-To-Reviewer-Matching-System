However, in order to utilize some syntax information between the pair of words, we adopt the syntactic distance representation of CITATION, named Collins distance for convenience,,
5 Related Works 5.1 Dependency Parsing Both the graph-based (CITATIONa; CITATION; CITATION) and the transition-based (CITATION; CITATION) parsing algorithms are related to our word-pair classification model,,
We choose the 2nd-ordered MST model CITATION as the baseline,,
Previous graph-based dependency models usually use the index distance of word i and word j 1 We exclude the in between features of CITATIONa) since preliminary experiments show that these features bring no improvement to the word-pair classification model,,
The relative weight is adjusted to maximize the performance on the development set, using an algorithm similar to minimum error-rate training CITATION,,
