Early attempts to focus on distinct attitude types in the task of attitude analysis were made by CITATION, who determined a potent,,
ons (e.g., see word unfriendly in Table 1) or based on the availability of the words conveying different attitude types, is made based on the analysis of: 1) morphological tags of nominal heads and their premodifiers in the clause (e.g., first person pronoun, third person pronoun, demonstrative pronoun, nominative or genitive noun, etc.); 2) the sequence of hypernymic semantic relations of a particular noun in WordNet CITATION, which allows to determine its conceptual domain (e.g., person, human being, artifact, event, etc.); 3) the annotations from the Stanford Named Entity Recognizer CITATION that labels PERSON, ORGANIZATION, and LOCATION entities,,
2.3 Modal Operators Consideration of the modal operators in the tasks of opinion mining and attitude analysis is very important, as they indicate a degree of persons belief in the truth of the proposition, which is subjective in nature CITATION,,

However, the concentration only on adjectives expressing appraisal and their modifiers greatly narrows the potential of the CITATION approach,,
In this paper we introduce our system @AM (ATtitude Analysis Model), which (1) classifies sentences according to the fine-grained attitude labels (nine affect categories CITATION: anger, disgust, fear, guilt, interest, joy, sadness, shame, surprise; four polarity labels for judgment and appreciation: POS jud, NEG jud, POS app, NEG app; and neutral); (2) assigns the strength of the attitude; and (3) determines the level of confidence, with which the attitude is expressed,,

tude Label The decision on the most appropriate final label for the clause, in case @AM annotates it using different attitude types according to the words with multiple annotations (e.g., see word unfriendly in Table 1) or based on the availability of the words conveying different attitude types, is made based on the analysis of: 1) morphological tags of nominal heads and their premodifiers in the clause (e.g., first person pronoun, third person pronoun, demonstrative pronoun, nominative or genitive noun, etc.); 2) the sequence of hypernymic semantic relations of a particular noun in WordNet CITATION, which allows to determine its conceptual domain (e.g., person, human being, artifact, event, etc.); 3) the annotations from the Stanford Named Entity Recognizer CITATION that labels PERSON, ORGANIZATION, and LOCATION entities,,
