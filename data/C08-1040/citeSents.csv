Degree centrality, closeness, and betweenness CITATION are among the most known methods for measuring centrality of nodes in a network,,
The model presented in this paper assumes that the probabilities of a document belonging to a certain topic varies smoothly over time and the words within a given document have exactly the same probability of being drawn from a particular topic CITATION,,
For example it has been used to measure centrality in hyperlinked web pages networks (CITATION; CITATION), lexical networks (CITATION; CITATION; CITATION; CITATION), and semantic networks CITATION,,
We used the model described in CITATION for this purpose,,
Some other possible similarity measures are edit distance, language models CITATION, or generation probabilities CITATION,,
In CITATION, the authors try to automatically classify speeches, from the US Congress debates, as supporting or opposing a given topic by taking a,,
4.1 Computing Speaker Salience The method we used is similar to the methods described in (CITATION; CITATION; CITATION), which were originally used for ranking sentences and documents in extractive summarization and information retrieval systems,,
In CITATION, the authors try to automatically classify speeches, from the US Congress debates, as supporting or opposing a given topic by taking advantage of the voting records of the speakers,,
Equation (4) can then be rewritten, assuming a uniform escape probability, as: p = p[dU + (1 d)B] (6) where N is the total number of nodes, U is a square matrix with U(i, j) = 1/N for all i, j, and d is the escape probability chosen in the interval [0.1, 0.2] CITATION,,
CITATION introduce MavenRank , which is a method based on lexical ce,,
5.2 Experimental Setup We used results from CITATION to get topic clusters from the data, as described in Section 3,,
To help the random walker escape from periodic or disconnected components, CITATION suggests reserving a small escape probability at each node that represents a chance of jumping to any node in the graph, making the Markov chain irreducible and aperiodic, which guarantees the existence of the eigenvector,,
The average sized topic cluster had several hundred speech documents CITATION,,
The model of CITATION is most closely related to the model of CITATION, who present a generalization of the model use,,
CITATION introduce MavenRank , which is a method based on lexical centrality that identifies the most influential members of the US Senate,,
5 Experiments and Results 5.1 Data We used the United States Congressional Speech corpus CITATION in our experiment,,
CITATION introduce a multinomial mixture model to cluster political speeches into topics or related categories,,
Our method is based on the ones described in (CITATION; CITATION; CITATION), The objective of this paper is to dynamically rank speakers or participants in a discussion,,
The Congressional Record is a verbatim transcript of the speeches made in the US House of Representatives and Senate and includes tens of thousands of speeches per year CITATION,,
These two properties make the model different than standard mixture models CITATION and the latent Dirichlet allocation model of CITATION,,
The inverse document frequency of a term w is given by CITATION idf(w) = log \x12 N nw \x13 (1) where nw is the number of speeches in the cluster containing the term w, and N is the number of documents in the cluster,,
The model of CITATION is most closely related to the model of CITATION, who present a generalization of the model used by CITATION,,
In CITATION, a network analysis of the members and committees of the US House of Representatives is performed,,
