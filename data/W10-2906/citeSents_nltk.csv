These results carry over to machine translation, where we can achieve slightly better BLEU improvements than the supervised model of CITATION since we are able to train our model directly on the parallel data where we perform rule e,,
Our work falls into the final category: We wish to use bilingual data to improve monolingual models which are already trained on large amounts of data and effective on their own (CITATION; CITATION; CITATION; Burkett an,,

We then used the same sentences to extract tree-to-string transducer rules from target-side (English) trees CITATION,,
We further simplify inference in our model by working in a reranking setting (CITATION; CITATION), where we only consider the top k outputs from monolingual models in both languages, for a total of k2 labels y,,
These results carry over to machine translation, where we can achieve slightly better BLEU improvements than the supervised model of CITATION since we are able to train our model directly on the parallel data where we perform rule extraction,,
3.1 Including Weakened Models Now that we have defined our bilingual model, we could train it to agree with the output of the monolingual model (CITATION; CITATION),,

Two recent, successful unsupervised induction methods are those of CITATION and CITATION,,
 the maximum-scoring matching CITATION: A(; x) = log X y max a \x12 exp h &gt; (y1, a, y2) i\x13 ,,
This observation has formed the basis for important work on syntax projection across languages (CITATION; CITATION; CITATION) and unsupervised syntax induction in multiple languages CITATION, as well as other tasks, such as cross-lingual named entity recognition (CITATION; CITATION) and information retrieval CITATION,,

First, we use the word alignment density features from CITATION, which measure how well the aligned entity pair matches up with alignments from an independent 48 \x0cInput: full and weakened monolingual models: p1(y1|x1), p2(y2|x2), pw 1 (y1|x1), pw 2 (y2|x2) unannotated bilingual data: U Output: bilingual parameters: , 1, 2 1,,
We cast this problem in the multiple-view (multiview) learning framework (CITATION; CITATION; CITATION; Ganchev et al,,

The bilingual data consists of the parallel part of the Chinese treebank (articles 1-270), which also includes manually parsed English translations of each Chinese sentence CITATION,,
One obvious choice is to choose the labeling that maximizes the agreement distribution (CITATION; CITATION),,
For this problem, our method automatically learns (a variation on) earlier hand-designed rule-based bilingual NER predictors (CITATION; CITATION), resulting in absolute performance gains of up to 16.1% F1,,

For comparison, we also show results for the supervised bilingual model of CITATION,,
We trained both our full and weakened monolingual English models on the Penn Wall Street Journal corpus CITATION, as described in Section 4,,
Our experimental setup is as follows: first, we used the first 100,000 sentences of the EnglishChinese bitext from CITATION to train Moses CITATION, a phrase-based MT system that we use as a baseline,,
We parameterize the bilingual view using at most one-to-one matchings between nodes of structured labels in each language CITATION,,
For the bilingual model, we use the same bilingual feature set as CITATION,,

We used the Stanford NER tagger CITATION with its default configuration as our full monolingual model for each language,,
Procedurally, our work is most closely related to that of CITATION,,
This maxlikelihood optimization can be solved by an EMlike procedure CITATION,,

For this task, we follow the setup of CITATION, who improved Chinese and English monolingual parsers using parallel, hand-parsed text,,
We cast this problem in the multiple-view (multiview) learning framework (CITATION; CITATION; CITATION; CITATION),,

In our parsing experiments, we use the Berkeley parser (CITATION; CITATION), a split-merge latent variable parser, for our monolingual models,,
