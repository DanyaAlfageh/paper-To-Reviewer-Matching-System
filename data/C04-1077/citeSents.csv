 To examine the effectiveness of minimizing redundant sentences, we compare the Maximal Marginal Relevance (MMR) based approach CITATION with the clustering approach CITATION,,
 A set of sentences that human annotators judge as being important in a document set (CITATION; CITATION; CITATION),,
, a set of sentences in the original documents that correspond to the sentences in the abstracts(CITATION; CITATION; CITATION; CITATION),,
1 Number of Sentences System Should Extract Precision and Recall are generally used as evaluation matrices for sentence extraction, and we used the PR Breaking Point (Precision = Recall) for the evaluation of extracts in TSC1 CITATION,,
1 Pseudo Question-Answering Sometimes question-answering (QA) by human subjects is used for evaluation (CITATION; CITATION),,
 The background to this evaluation is inspired by TIPSTER SUMMACs QA track CITATION,,
2 Compared Extraction Methods We used the lead-based method, the TFc IDF-based method CITATION and the sequential patternbased method CITATION, and compared performance of these summarization methods on the TSC3 corpus,,

 This is an extension of Lins method CITATION,,
 In 1998, TIPSTER SUMMAC CITATION took place and the Document Understanding Conference (DUC)1 has been held annually since 2001,,
 Multiple document summarization was included for the first time as one of the tasks at TSC2 (in 2002) CITATION,,
