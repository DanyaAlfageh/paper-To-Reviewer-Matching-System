This is an extension of Lins method CITATION,,
3.1 Intrinsic Metrics 3.1.1 Number of Sentences System Should Extract Precision and Recall are generally used as evaluation matrices for sentence extraction, and we used the PR Breaking Point (Precision = Recall) for the evaluation of extracts in TSC1 CITATION,,
The background to this evaluation is inspired by TIPSTER SUMMACs QA track CITATION,,
In addition, this is the same even if we use the SummBank corpus CITATION,,
This is similar to Relative Utility CITATION,,

4.2 Compared Extraction Methods We used the lead-based method, the TFc IDF-based method CITATION and the sequential patternbased method CITATION, and compared performance of these summarization methods on the TSC3 corpus,,
A set of sentences that human annotators judge as being important in a document set (CITATION; CITATION; CITATION),,

In 1998, TIPSTER SUMMAC CITATION took place and the Document Understanding Conference (DUC)1 has been held annually since 2001,,
Multiple document summarization was included for the first time as one of the tasks at TSC2 (in 2002) CITATION,,
A set of sentences that are suitable as a source for producing an abstract, i.e., a set of sentences in the original documents that correspond to the sentences in the abstracts(CITATION; CITATION; CITATION; CITATION),,

To examine the effectiveness of minimizing redundant sentences, we compare the Maximal Marginal Relevance (MMR) based approach CITATION with the clustering approach CITATION,,
