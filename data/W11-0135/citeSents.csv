 1 Introduction The Recognizing Textual Entailment (RTE) task CITATION aims at capturing a broad range of inferences that are relevant for several Natural Language Processing applications, and consists of deciding, given two text fragments, whether the meaning of one text (the hypothesis H) is entailed, i,,

 Getting closer to the definition of component-based TE presented at the beginning of this Section, in CITATION we propose a framework for the definition and combination of specialized entailment engines, each of which able to deal with a certain aspect of language variability,,

1 Highlighting the need of resources for solving textual inference problems in the context of RTE, CITATION challenge the NLP community to contribute to a joint, long term effort in this 1 The resulting data sets are freely available at http://hlt,,
 In some cases, resources like WordNet demonstrated to be very useful, while for other systems their contribution is limited or even damaging, as observed also in CITATION,,
