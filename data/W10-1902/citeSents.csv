2 Related work NER is a widely studied topic in text mining research, and many new challenges are seen in domain-specific applications, such as biomedical NER CITATION,,
In CITATION, skip edges were linked between sentences with nonlocal pragmatic dependencies to rank meetings,,

In CITATION, skip-chain CRF was used to detect the context an,,
Linear-chain CRF has also been successfully applied to other NLP tasks such as POS-tagging CITATION and sentence chunking (Sha and Pereira, 2003),,
An FNCC means that a gold-standard mention is missed by the system while its skip edge linked gene mention is correctly labeled, which is similar to the inconsistent miss in CITATION, as the IE94 in the first example,,

In CITATION, skip-chain CRF was used to detect the context and answers from online forums,,
CITATION proposed a twostep framework to perform biomedical NER using SVM: firstly detecting the boundaries of named entities using classifiers; secondly classifying each named entity into predefined target types,,
Since proposed in CITATION, CRF has been applied to many sequence labeling tasks, including recognizing gene mentions from biomedical text CITATION,,

In the speaker name extraction task CITATION, only identical capitalized words are linked, because there is few variations in the speakers name,,
Many information extraction systems had a dictionary matching module to perform preliminary detection of named entities (Schuhmann et al., 2007; CITATION; Wang et al., 2010),,
The most close work to ours was in CITATION, which used skip-chain CRF to extract information from email messages announcing seminars,,
re seen in domain-specific applications, such as biomedical NER CITATION,,
Most dictionary based NER systems focused on: (1) integrating and normalizing different biomedical databases to improve the quality of the dictionary to be used; (2) improving matching strategies that are more suitable for biomedical terminologies; and (3) making filtering rules for postprocessing to refine the matching results or to adjust the boundary of entities, see (CITATION; CITATION; Yang et al., 2008),,
The overview reports from these competitions, presenting stateof-the-art of biomedical NER studies, show that linear-chain Conditional Random Fields (CRF) is one of the most commonly used models and has the most competitive results (CITATION; Smith et al., 2008),,
