 Most dictionary based NER systems focused on: (1) integrating and normalizing different biomedical databases to improve the quality of the dictionary to be used; (2) improving matching strategies that are more suitable for biomedical terminologies; and (3) making filtering rules for postprocessing to refine the matching results or to adjust the boundary of entities, see (CITATION; CITATION; Yang et al,,

 For the first category, Support Vector Machine (SVM) was a commonly adopted model (CITATION; CITATION),,
 CITATION proposed a twostep framework to perform biomedical NER using SVM: firstly detecting the boundaries of named entities using classifiers; secondly classifying each named entity into predefined target types,,

 The overview reports from these competitions, presenting stateof-the-art of biomedical NER studies, show that linear-chain Conditional Random Fields (CRF) is one of the most commonly used models and has the most competitive results (CITATION; Smith et al,,
 Linear-chain CRF has also been successfully applied to other NLP tasks such as POS-tagging CITATION and sentence chunking (Sha and Pereira, 2003),,
 Since proposed in CITATION, CRF has been applied to many sequence labeling tasks, including recognizing gene mentions from biomedical text CITATION,,

 In the speaker name extraction task CITATION, only identical capitalized words are linked, because there is few variations in the speakers name,,
 An FNCC means that a gold-standard mention is missed by the system while its skip edge linked gene mention is correctly labeled, which is similar to the inconsistent miss in CITATION, as the IE94 in the first example,,
