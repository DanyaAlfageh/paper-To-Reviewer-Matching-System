To enforce (2), we select instances that have never been extracted by any KE of c. More formally, we define N(c) as follows: N(c) = [ ciC P(ci) \\ U(c) (3) The main advantage of this method is that it acquires negatives that are semantic near-misses of the target class, thus allowing the learning algorithm to focus on these borderline cases CITATION.,,
