Further, we compare the performance of our method against both CITATION and CITATION, showing 17% and 15% improvements in absolute mean average precision, respectively,,
This intuition is explored by the Ensemble Semantics (ES) framework proposed by Pennacchiotti and CITATION, which outperforms previous state-of-the-art systems,,
Selftraining techniques (or bootsrapping) CITATION start with a small set of labeled data, and iteratively classify unlabeled data, selecting the most confident predictions as additional training,,
Selftraining has been applied in many NLP tasks, such as word sense disambiguation CITATION and relation extraction CITATION,,
More formally, we define N(c) as follows: N(c) = [ ciC P(ci) \\ U(c) (3) The main advantage of this method is that it acquires negatives that are semantic near-misses of the target class, thus allowing the learning algorithm to focus on these borderline cases CITATION,,
166 \x0ccific implementation, we select a set of positive examples from the CBC repository CITATION,,
CITATION propose a pattern-based bootstrapping approach for harvesting generalized names (e.g., diseases, locations), where labeled negative examples for a given class are taken from positive seed examples of competing classes (e.g,,
 of entities to better interpret queries CITATION, to improve query suggestions CITATION and to understand query intents CITATION,,
2.1.1 Acquiring Negative Examples Acquiring negative training examples is a much more daunting task CITATION,,
Co-training has been successfully applied to various applications, such as statistical parsing CITATION and web pages classification CITATION,,
This is particularly troublesome for applications such as web search that require large numbers of semantic classes in order to have a sufficient coverage of facts and objects CITATION,,
3 A Use Case: Entity Extraction Entity extraction is a fundamental task in NLP (CITATION; CITATION) and web search (CITATION; CITATION; CITATION), responsible for extracting instances of semantic classes (e.g., Brad Pitt and Tom Hanks are instances of the class Actors),,
There is mounting evidence that combining knowledge sources and information extraction systems yield significant improvements over applying each in isolation (CITATION; CITATION),,
In response, automated techniques for entity extraction have been proposed (CITATION; CITATION; CITATION; Pantel et al., 2009),,
This intuition is explored by the Ensemble Semantics (ES) framework proposed by Pennacchiotti and CITATION, which outperforms previous s,,
The system adopts as a ranker a supervised Gradient Boosted Decision Tree regression model (GBDT) CITATION,,
4.1 Experimental Setup We evaluate over three semantic classes: Actors (movie, tv and stage actors); Athletes (professional and amateur); Musicians (singers, musicians, composers, bands, and orchestras), so to compare with (Pennacchiotti and CITATION),,
Similar approaches are used among others in CITATION for learning semantic lexicons, in CITATION for namedentity recognition, and in CITATION for hierarchical text categorization,,
2 Automatic Acquisition of Training Data Supervised machine learning algorithms require training data that is: (1) balanced and large enough to correctly model the problem at hand (CITATION; CITATION); and (2) representative of the unlabeled data to decode, i.e., training and unlabeled instances should be ideally drawn from the same distribution (CITATION; CITATION),,
tter interpret queries CITATION, to improve query suggestions CITATION and to understand query intents CITATION,,
Search engines such as Bing, Yahoo, and Google collect large sets of entities to better interpret queries CITATION, to improve query suggestions CITATION and to understand query intents CITATION,,
In this section we apply our methods for automatically acquiring training data to the ES entity extraction system described in Pennacchiotti and CITATION.1 The system relies on the following three knowledge extractors,,
This instantiation implements the system presented in CITATION,,
