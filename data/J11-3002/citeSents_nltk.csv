The PERSONAGE architecture (Figure 1) builds on a standard natural language generation (NLG) pipeline architecture as described in CITATION, Kittredge, Korelsky, and Rambow (1991), and CITATION.,,
The mapping from a finding to parameters represents a set of hypotheses about how the finding can be implemented, however, as discussed in more detail in CITATION and CITATION.,,
For example, there are 12 content planning parameters shown in the first block of Table 2; these control aspects of utterances such as their verbosity, rhetorical structure, content selection parameters such as positive content, and the level of redundancy and restatement CITATION.,,

These correlations are unexpectedly high; in corpus analyses, significant correlations as low as .05 to .15 are typically observed between averaged personality ratings and linguistic markers (CITATION; Mehl, Gosling, and Pennebaker 2006).,,
It is important to note that the magnitudes of the model correlations are high compared to traditional correlations between personality and linguistic markers, which typically range from .05 to .10 (CITATION; Mehl, Gosling, and Pennebaker 2006).,,
