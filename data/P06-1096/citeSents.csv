1 Introduction The generative, noisy-channel paradigm has historically served as the foundation for most of the work in statistical machine translation CITATION,,
The proposed system is phrase-based, as in CITATION, but uses an online perceptron training scheme to learn model parameters,,
Another example of this framework is the hierarchical model of CITATION,,
We experimented with two levels of distortion: monotonic, where the phrasal alignment is monotonic (but word reordering is still possible within a phrase) and limited distortion, where only adjacent phrases are allowed to exchange positions CITATION,,
In the future, we plan to explore our discriminative framework on a full distortion model CITATION or even a hierarchical model CITATION,,
The first approach is to reuse the components of a generative model, but tune their relative weights in a discriminative fashion (CITATION; CITATION; CITATION),,
The second approach is to use reranking, in which a baseline classifier generates an n-best list of candidate translations, and a separate discriminative classifier chooses amongst them (CITATION; CITATION),,
2.2 Perceptron-based training To tune the parameters w of the model, we use the averaged perceptron algorithm CITATION because of its efficiency and past success on various NLP tasks (CITATION; CITATION),,

The proposed system is phrase-based, as in CITATION, but uses an online perceptron training scheme to learn model parameters,,
Unlike minimum error rate training CITATION, our system is able to exploit large numbers of specific features in the same manner as static reranking systems (CITATION; CITATION),,
The phrase-based model of CITATION is an instance of this framework,,
At the end we ran our models once on TEST to get final numbers.2 4 Models Our experiments used phrase-based models CITATION, which require a translation table and language model for decoding and feature computation,,
To facilitate comparison with previous work, we created the translation tables using the same techniques as CITATION.3 The language model was a Kneser-Ney interpolated trigram model generated using the SRILM toolkit CITATION,,

6 We used sentences of length 515 to facilitate comparisons with CITATION and to enable rapid experimentation with various feature sets,,
6.4 Alignment constellation features CITATION demonstrated that choosing the appropriate heuristic for extracting phrases is very important,,
The process of phrase extraction is difficult to optimize in a non-discriminative setting: many heuristics have been proposed CITATION, but it is not obvious which one should be chosen for a given language pair,,
The discrepancy between DEV performance and TEST performance is due to temporal distance from TRAIN and high variance in BLEU score.11 We also compared our model with Pharaoh CITATION,,
We tuned Pharaohs four parameters using minimum error rate training CITATION on DEV.12 We obtained an increase of 0.8 9 As in the POS features, we map each phrase pair to its majority constellation,,
