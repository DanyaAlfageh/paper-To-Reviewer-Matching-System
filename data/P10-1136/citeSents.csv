As shown in CITATION, the lexical category distribution of web queries is dramatically different from that of natural languages,,
Alternatively, the knowledge of IHs, IMs and semantic labels of IMs may be used as additional evidence in a learning to rank framework CITATION,,
The most relevant ones are on the problem of query tagging, i.e., assigning semantic labels to query terms (CITATION; CITATION),,
2.3 Information extraction Finally, there exist large bodies of work on information extraction using models based on Markov and semi-Markov CRFs (CITATION; CITATION), and in particular for the task of named entity recognition CITATION,,
4.2 Semi-Markov CRFs In contrast to standard CRFs, semi-Markov CRFs directly model the segmentation of an input sequence as well as a classification of the segments CITATION, i.e., p(s|x) = 1 Z(x) exp N+1 X j=1 f(sj1, sj, x) (3) In this case, the features f(sj1, sj, x) are defined on segments instead of on word tokens,,
Most previous works in this area focus on query intent classification (CITATION; CITATIONb; CITATION),,
We then mark the right most NP chunk before any prepositional phrase or adjective clause, and apply the NP head rules CITATION to the marked NP chunk,,
4.1 CRFs One natural approach to extracting the semantic structure of queries is to use linear-chain CRFs CITATION,,
In particular, a number of works investigated the importance of head noun extraction in understanding what-type questions (CITATION; CITATIONa),,
2 Related Works 2.1 Query intent understanding As mentioned in the introduction, previous works on query intent understanding have largely focused on classification, i.e., automatically mapping queries into semantic classes (CITATION; CITATIONb; CITATION),,
Note that a substantial amount of research effort has been dedicated to automatic lexicon acquisition from the Web (CITATION; CITATION),,
We first run a POS-tagger and a chunker jointly on each query, where the POS-tagger/chunker is based on an HMM system trained on English Penn Treebank CITATION,,
can reformulate the query into a structured form or reweight different query constituents for structured data retrieval (CITATION; CITATION; CITATION),,
