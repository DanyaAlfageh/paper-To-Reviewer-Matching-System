 We first run a POS-tagger and a chunker jointly on each query, where the POS-tagger/chunker is based on an HMM system trained on English Penn Treebank CITATION,,
 We then mark the right most NP chunk before any prepositional phrase or adjective clause, and apply the NP head rules CITATION to the marked NP chunk,,
 As shown in CITATION, the lexical category distribution of web queries is dramatically different from that of natural languages,,
 can reformulate the query into a structured form or reweight different query constituents for structured data retrieval (CITATION; CITATION; CITATION),,
 Alternatively, the knowledge of IHs, IMs and semantic labels of IMs may be used as additional evidence in a learning to rank framework CITATION,,

3 Information extraction Finally, there exist large bodies of work on information extraction using models based on Markov and semi-Markov CRFs (CITATION; CITATION), and in particular for the task of named entity recognition CITATION,,
