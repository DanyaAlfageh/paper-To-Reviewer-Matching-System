Literature (CITATION; Collins, 1999) has suggested that unlabeled data can be exploited together with labeled data by co-training two classifiers,,0

Two kinds of summarization approaches were suggested in the past, i.e., extractive (Radev et al., 2004; CITATION) and abstractive summarization (Dejong, 1978),,0
