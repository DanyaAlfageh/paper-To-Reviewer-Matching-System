CITATION employed features which were based on discourse entities, shallow s,,
Previous works on sentence ordering mainly focus on the MDS task (CITATION; CITATION; CITATION; CITATION; Madnani et al., 2007; CITATION; CITATION; CITATION; CITATION),,
It is typically applicable in the text generation field, both for concept-to-text generation and text-totext generation CITATION, such as multiple document summarization (MDS), question answering and so on,,
2 Related Work For works taking no use of source document, CITATION proposed a probabilistic model which learns constraints on sentence ordering from a corpus of texts,,
The probability model originates from CITATION, and we implement the model with four features of lemmatized noun, verb, adjective or adverb, and verb and noun related dependency,,
The two features of noun probability and dependency probability play an important role as demonstrated in CITATION,,
3.3 Overall Order Determination CITATION proved finding a permutation to maximize AGREE( ,PREF) is NPcomplete,,
CITATION investigated the utility of domain-specific content model for representing topic and topic shifts and the model performed well on the five selected domains,,
