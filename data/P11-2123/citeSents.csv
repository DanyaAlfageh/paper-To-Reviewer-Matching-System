CITATION performed experiments in statistical parsing of French, where terminal forms were replaced by more general symbols, particularly clusters of words obtained through unsupervised clustering,,
Regarding dependency parsing of the English PTB, currently Koo and Collins (2010) and CITATION hold the best results, with 93.0 and 92.9 unlabeled attachment score, respectively,,
