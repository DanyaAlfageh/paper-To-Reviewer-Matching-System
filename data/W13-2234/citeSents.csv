 This relatively simple approach to translation can be remarkably effective, and, since its introduction, it has been the basis for further innovations, including developing better models for distinguishing the good translations from bad ones (CITATION; CITATION; CITATION; CITATION), improving the identification of phrase pairs in parallel data (CITATION; CITATION), and formal generalizations to gapped rules and rich nonterminal types (CITATION; CITATION),,
