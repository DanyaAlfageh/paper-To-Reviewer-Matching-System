Abstract
We describe new algorithms for train-
ing tagging models, as an alternative
to maximum-entropy models or condi-
tional random elds (CRFs). The al-
gorithms rely on Viterbi decoding of
training examples, combined with sim-
ple additive updates. We describe the-
ory justifying the algorithms through
a modication of the proof of conver-
gence of the perceptron algorithm for
classication problems. We give exper-
imental results on part-of-speech tag-
gingandbasenounphrasechunking,in
both cases showing improvements over
results for a maximum-entropy tagger.
1 Introduction
Maximum-entropy (ME) models are justiably
a very popular choice for tagging problems in
Natural Language Processing: for example see
(Ratnaparkhi 96) for their use on part-of-speech
tagging, and (McCallum et al. 2000) for their
use on a FAQ segmentation task. ME models
have the advantage of being quite exible in the
features that can be incorporated in the model.
However, recenttheoreticalandexperimentalre-
sults in (Laerty et al. 2001) have highlighted
problemswiththeparameterestimationmethod
for ME models. In response to these problems,
they describe alternative parameter estimation
methods based on Conditional Markov Random
Fields(CRFs). (Laerty et al. 2001) give exper-
imental results suggesting that CRFs can per-
form signicantly better than ME models.
In this paper we describe parameter estima-
tionalgorithmswhicharenaturalalternativesto
CRFs. The algorithms are based on the percep-
tron algorithm (Rosenblatt 58), and the voted
or averaged versions of the perceptron described
in (Freund & Schapire 99). These algorithms
have been shown by (Freund & Schapire 99) to
be competitive withmodern learningalgorithms
such as support vector machines; however, they
have previously been applied mainly to classi-
cation tasks, and it is not entirely clear how the
algorithms can be carried across to NLP tasks
such as tagging or parsing.
This paper describes variants of the percep-
tron algorithm for tagging problems. The al-
gorithms rely on Viterbi decoding of training
examples, combined with simple additive up-
dates. We describe theory justifying the algo-
rithmthroughamodicationoftheproofofcon-
vergence of the perceptron algorithm for classi-
cation problems. We give experimental results
on part-of-speech tagging and base noun phrase
chunking, in both cases showing improvements
over results for a maximum-entropy tagger (a
11.9% relative reduction in error for POS tag-
ging, a 5.1% relative reduction in error for NP
chunking). Although we concentrate on tagging
problems in this paper, the theoretical frame-
work and algorithm described in section 3 of
this paper should be applicable to a wide va-
riety of models where Viterbi-style algorithms
can be used for decoding: examples are Proba-
bilistic Context-Free Grammars, or ME models
for parsing. See (Collinsand Duy 2001; Collins
and Duy 2002; Collins 2002) for other applica-
tions of the voted perceptronto NLP problems.1

In this section, as a motivating example, we de-
scribe a special case of the algorithm in this
paper: the algorithm applied to a trigram tag-
ger. In a trigram HMM tagger, each trigram

of tags and each tag/word pair have associated
parameters. We write the parameter associated
with a trigram hx;y;zi as x;y;z, and the param-
eter associated with a tag/word pair (t;w) as
t;w. A common approach is to take the param-
etersto beestimatesofconditionalprobabilities:
x;y;z = logP(z j x;y), t;w = logP(w j t).
For convenience we will use w[1:n] as short-
hand for a sequence of words [w1;w2 :::wn],
and t[1:n] as shorthand for a taq sequence
[t1;t2 :::tn]. In a trigram tagger the score for
a tagged sequence t[1:n] paired with a word se-
quence w[1:n] is2 Pn
i=1 ti 2;ti 1;ti + Pn
i=1 ti;wi.
When the parameters are conditional probabil-
ities as above this \score" is an estimate of the
log of the joint probability P(w[1:n];t[1:n]). The
Viterbialgorithmcanbeusedto ndthe highest
scoring tagged sequence under this score.
As an alternative to maximum{likelihood pa-
rameter estimates, this paper will propose the
following estimation algorithm. Say the train-
ing set consists of n tagged sentences, the i'th
sentence being of length ni. We will write these
examples as (wi
[1:ni];ti
[1:ni]) for i = 1:::n. Then
the training algorithm is as follows:
 Choose a parameter T dening the number
of iterations over the training set.3
 Initially set all parameters x;y;z and t;w
to be zero.
 For t = 1:::T;i = 1:::n: Use the Viterbi
algorithm to nd the best tagged sequence for
sentence wi
[1:ni] under the current parameter
settings: we call this tagged sequence z[1:ni].
For every tag trigram hx;y;zi seen c1 times in
ti
[1:ni] and c2 times in z[1:ni] where c1 6= c2 set
x;y;z = x;y;z + c1 c2. For every tag/word
pair ht;wi seen c1 times in (wi
[1:ni];ti
[1:ni]) and
c2 times in (wi
[1:ni];z[1:ni]) where c1 6= c2 set
t;w = t;w +c1 c2.
As an example, say the i'th tagged sentence
(wi
[1:ni];ti
[1:ni]) in training data is
the/D man/N saw/V the/D dog/N
and under the current parameter settings the
highest scoring tag sequence (wi
[1:ni];z[1:ni]) is
2We take t 1 and t 2 to be special NULL tag symbols.
3T is usually chosen by tuning on a development set.
the/D man/N saw/N the/D dog/N
Then the parameter update will add 1 to the
parameters D;N;V , N;V;D, V;D;N, V;saw and
subtract 1 from the parameters D;N;N, N;N;D,
N;D;N, N;saw. Intuitively this has the ef-
fect of increasing the parameter values for fea-
tures which were \missing" from the proposed
sequence z[1:ni], and downweighting parameter
values for \incorrect" features in the sequence
z[1:ni]. Note that if z[1:ni] = ti
[1:ni] | i.e., the
proposed tag sequence is correct | no changes
are made to the parameter values.
2.2 Local and Global Feature Vectors
Wenowdescribehowtogeneralizethealgorithm
to more general representations of tagged se-
quences. In this section we describe the feature-
vector representations whichare commonlyused
in maximum-entropy models for tagging, and
which are also used in this paper.
In maximum-entropy taggers (Ratnaparkhi
96; McCallum et al. 2000), the tagging prob-
lem is decomposed into sequence of decisions in
tagging the problem in left-to-right fashion. At
each point there is a \history" { the context in
which a tagging decision is made { and the task
is to predict the tag given the history. Formally,
a history is a 4-tuple ht 1;t 2;w[1:n];ii where
t 1;t 2 are the previoustwo tags, w[1:n] isan ar-
ray specifyingthe n words in the inputsentence,
and i is the index of the word being tagged. We
use H to denote the set of all possible histories.
Maximum-entropy models represent the tag-
gingtaskthroughafeature-vector representation
ofhistory-tagpairs. Afeaturevector representa-
tion  : HT ! Rd is a function  that maps a
history{tag pair to a d-dimensional feature vec-
tor. Each component s(h;t) for s = 1:::d
could be an arbitrary function of (h;t). It is
common (e.g., see (Ratnaparkhi 96)) for each
feature s to be an indicator function. For ex-
ample, one such feature might be
1000(h;t) =
8
>
<
>
:
1 if current word wi is the
and t = DT
0 otherwise
Similar features might be dened for every
word/tag pair seen in training data. Another
feature type might track trigramsof tags, for ex-
ample 1001(h;t) = 1 if ht 2;t 1;ti = hD, N, Vi
and 0 otherwise. Similar features would be de-
ned for all trigrams of tags seen in training. A
real advantage of these models comes from the
freedom in dening these features: for example,
(Ratnaparkhi 96; McCallum et al. 2000) both
describe feature sets which would be di√Ücult to
incorporate in a generative model.
In addition to feature vector representations
of history/tag pairs, we will nd it convenient
to dene feature vectors of (w[1:n];t[1:n]) pairs
where w[1:n] is a sequence of n words, and t[1:n]
is an entire tag sequence. We use  to de-
note a function from (w[1:n];t[1:n]) pairs to d-
dimensional feature vectors. We will often refer
to  as a \global" representation, in contrast
to  as a \local" representation. The particular
global representations considered in this paper
are simple functions of local representations:
s(w[1:n];t[1:n]) =
n
X
i=1
s(hi;ti) (1)
where hi = hti 1;ti 2;w[1:n];ii. Each global
feature s(w[1:n];t[1:n]) is simply the value for
the local representation s summed over all his-
tory/tag pairs in (w[1:n];t[1:n]). If the local fea-
turesareindicatorfunctions,thentheglobalfea-
tures will typically be \counts". For example,
with 1000 dened as above, 1000(w[1:n];t[1:n])
is the number of times the is seen tagged as DT
in the pair of sequences (w[1:n];t[1:n]).
2.3 Maximum-Entropy Taggers
In maximum-entropy taggers the feature vectors
 together with a parameter vector 
 2 Rd are
used to dene a conditional probability distri-
bution over tags given a history as
P(t j h; 
) = e

ss(h;t)
Z(h; 
)
where Z(h; 
) = P

ss(h;l). The log of
this probability has the form logp(t j h; 
) =
Pd
s=1 ss(h;t) logZ(h; 
), and hence the log
probability for a (w[1:n];t[1:n]) pair will be

X
s=1
ss(hi;ti)
X
i
logZ(hi; 
) (2)
where hi = hti 1;ti 2;w[1:n];ii. Given parame-
ter values 
, and an input sentence w[1:n], the
highest probability tagged sequence under the
formula in Eq. 2 can be found e√Üciently using
the Viterbi algorithm.
The parameter vector 
 is estimated from a
training set of sentence/tagged-sequence pairs.
Maximum-likelihood parameter values can be
estimated using Generalized Iterative Scaling
(Ratnaparkhi 96), or gradient descent methods.
In some cases it may be preferable to apply a
bayesian approach which includes a prior over
parameter values.
2.4 A New Estimation Method
We now describe an alternative method for es-
timating parameters of the model. Given a se-
quence of words w[1:n] and a sequence of part of
speech tags, t[1:n], we will take the \score" of a
tagged sequence to be
n
X
i=1
d
X
s=1
ss(hi;ti) =
d
X
s=1
ss(w[1:n];t[1:n]) :
where hi is again hti 1;ti 2;w[1:n];ii. Note that
this is almost identical to Eq. 2, but without the
local normalization terms logZ(hi; 
). Under
this method for assigning scores to tagged se-
quences, the highest scoring sequence of tags for
an inputsentence can befoundusingthe Viterbi
algorithm. (We can use an almost identical de-
coding algorithm to that for maximum-entropy
taggers, the dierence being that local normal-
ization terms do not need to be calculated.)
We then propose the trainingalgorithm ing-
ure 1. The algorithm takes T passes over the
training sample. All parameters are initially set
to be zero. Each sentence in turn is decoded us-
ing the current parameter settings. If the high-
est scoring sequence under the current model is
not correct, the parameters s are updated in a
simple additive fashion.
Note that if the local features s are indica-
tor functions, then the global features s willbe
counts. In this case the update will add cs ds
to each parameter s, where cs is the number
of times the s'th feature occurred in the cor-
rect tag sequence, and ds is the number of times

it occurs in highest scoring sequence under the
current model. For example, if the features s
are indicator functions tracking all trigrams and
word/tag pairs, then the training algorithm is
identical to that given in section 2.1.
2.5 Averaging Parameters
There is a simple renement to the algorithm
in gure 1, called the \averaged parameters"
method. Dene t;i
s to be the value for the s'th
parameter after the i'th training example has
been processed in pass t over the training data.
Then the \averaged parameters" are dened as
s = P
t=1:::T;i=1:::n t;i
s =nT for all s = 1:::d.
It is simple to modify the algorithm to store
this additional set of parameters. Experiments
in section 4 show that the averaged parameters
perform signicantly better than the nal pa-
rameters T;n
s . The theory in the next section
gives justication for the averaging method.
3 Theory Justifying the Algorithm
In this section we give a general algorithm for
problems such as tagging and parsing, and give
theorems justifyingthe algorithm. We alsoshow
how the tagging algorithm in gure 1 is a spe-
cial case of this algorithm. Convergence theo-
rems for the perceptron applied to classication
problems appear in (Freund & Schapire 99) {
the results in this section, and the proofs in sec-
tion 5, show how the classicationresults can be

carried over to problems such as tagging.
The task is to learn a mapping from inputs
x 2 X to outputs y 2 Y. For example, X might
be a set of sentences, with Y being a set of pos-
sible tag sequences. We assume:
 Training examples (xi;yi) for i = 1:::n.
 A function GEN which enumerates a set of
candidates GEN(x) for an input x.
 Arepresentation mappingeach(x;y) 2

where (x;y)  
 is the inner product
P
s ss(x;y). The learning task is to set the
parameter values 
 using the training examples
as evidence.
The tagging problem in section 2 can be
mapped to this setting as follows:
 Thetrainingexamplesaresentence/tagged-
sequence pairs: xi = wi
[1:ni] and yi = ti
[1:ni]
for i = 1:::n.
 Given a set of possible tags T , we dene
GEN(w[1:n]) = T n, i.e., the function GEN
maps an input sentence w[1:n] to the set of
all tag sequences of length n.
 The representation (x;y) =
(w[1:n];t[1:n]) is dened through local
feature vectors (h;t) where (h;t) is a
history/tag pair. (See Eq. 1.)
Figure 2 shows an algorithm for setting the
weights 
. It can be veried that the training
algorithm for taggers in gure 1 is a special case
of this algorithm, if we dene (xi;yi);GEN and
 as just described.
We will now give a rst theorem regarding
the convergence of this algorithm. This theorem
therefore also describes conditions under which
the algorithm in gure 1 converges. First, we
need the following denition:
Denition 1 Let GEN(xi) = GEN(xi) fyig. In
other words GEN(xi) is the set of incorrect candidates
for an example xi. We will say that a training sequence
(xi;yi) for i = 1:::n is separable with margin √Ü > 0
if there exists some vector U with jjUjj = 1 such that
8i;8z 2 GEN(xi); U (xi;yi) U (xi;z)  √Ü (3)
(jjUjj is the 2-norm of U, i.e., jjUjj =
pP
s U2
s.)
We can then state the following theorem (see
section 5 for a proof):
Theorem 1 For any training sequence (xi;yi) which is
separable with margin √Ü, then for the perceptron algorithm
in gure 2
Number of mistakes  R2
√Ü2
where R is a constant such that 8i;8z 2
GEN(xi) jj(xi;yi) (xi;z)jj  R.
This theorem implies that if there is a param-
eter vector U which makes zero errors on the
training set, then after a nite number of itera-
tions the training algorithm will have converged
to parameter values with zero training error. A
crucialpointisthatthenumberofmistakesisin-
dependent of the number of candidates for each
example (i.e. the size of GEN(xi) for each i),
dependingonly on the separation of the training
data, where separation is dened above. This
is important because in many NLP problems
GEN(x) can be exponential in the size of the
inputs. All of the convergence and generaliza-
tion results in this paper depend on notions of
separability rather than the size of GEN.
Two questions come to mind. First, are there
guarantees for the algorithm if the training data
is not separable? Second, performance on a
training sample is all very well, but what does
this guarantee about how well the algorithm
generalizes to newly drawn test examples? (Fre-
und & Schapire 99) discuss how the theory can
beextendedtodealwithbothofthesequestions.
The next sections describe how these results can
be applied to the algorithms in this paper.
3.1 Theory for inseparable data
Inthissection we give boundswhichapplywhen
the data is not separable. First, we need the
following denition:
Denition 2 Given a sequence (xi;yi), for a U, √Ü pair
dene mi = U(xi;yi) maxz2GEN(xi) U(xi;z) and
i = maxf0;√Ü mig. Finally, dene DU;√Ü =
pPn
i=1 2
i .
The value DU;√Ü is a measure of how close U
is to separating the training data with margin √Ü.
DU;√Ü is 0 if the vector U separates the data with
at least margin √Ü. If U separates almost all of
the examples with margin √Ü, but a few examples
are incorrectly tagged or have margin less than
√Ü, then DU;√Ü will take a relatively small value.
The following theorem then applies (see sec-
tion 5 for a proof):
Theorem 2 For any training sequence (xi;yi), for the
rst pass over the training set of the perceptron algorithm
in gure 2,
Number of mistakes  min
U;√Ü
(R +DU;√Ü)2
√Ü2
where R is a constant such that 8i;8z 2
GEN(xi) jj(xi;yi) (xi;z)jj  R, and the
min is taken over √Ü > 0, jjUjj = 1.
This theorem implies that if the training data
is \close" to being separable with margin √Ü {
i.e., there exists some U such that DU;√Ü is rela-
tivelysmall{thenthealgorithmwillagainmake
a small number of mistakes. Thus theorem 2
shows that the perceptron algorithm can be ro-
bust to some training data examples being dif-
cult or impossible to tag correctly.
3.2 Generalization results
Theorems 1 and 2 give results bounding the
number of errors on training samples, but the
question we are really interested in concerns
guarantees of how well the method generalizes
to new test examples. Fortunately, there are
several theoretical results suggesting that if the
perceptron algorithm makes a relatively small
number of mistakes on a training sample then it
islikelyto generalize wellto newexamples. This
section describes some of these results, which
originally appeared in (Freund & Schapire 99),
and are derived directly from results in (Helm-
bold and Warmuth 95).
First we dene a modication of the percep-
tron algorithm, the voted perceptron. We can
consider the rst pass of the perceptron algo-
rithm to build a sequence of parameter set-
tings 
1;i for i = 1:::n. For a given test ex-
ample x, each of these will dene an output
vi = argmaxz2GEN(x) 
1;i  (x;z). The voted
perceptron takes the most frequently occurring
output in the set fv1 :::vng. Thus the voted
perceptron is a method where each of the pa-
rameter settings 
1;i for i = 1:::n get a sin-
gle vote for the output, and the majority wins.
The averaged algorithm in section 2.5 can be
considered to be an approximation of the voted
method, withthe advantage that a single decod-
ing with the averaged parameters can be per-
formed, rather than n decodings with each of
the n parameter settings.
In analyzing the voted perceptron the one as-
sumption we will make is that there is some
unknown distribution P(x;y) over the set X 
Y, and that both training and test examples
are drawn independently, identically distributed
(i.i.d.) from this distribution. Corollary 1 of
(Freund & Schapire 99) then states:
Theorem 3 (Freund & Schapire 99) Assume all ex-
amples are generated i.i.d. at random. Let
h(x1;y1)i:::(xn;yn)i be a sequence of training examples
and let (xn+1;yn+1) be a test example. Then the prob-
ability (over the choice of all n + 1 examples) that the
voted-perceptron algorithm does not predict yn+1 on in-
put xn+1 is at most

where En+1[] is an expected value taken over n + 1 ex-

4 Experiments
4.1 Data Sets
We ran experiments on two data sets: part-of-
speech tagging on the Penn Wall Street Journal
treebank (Marcus et al. 93), and base noun-
phrase recognition on the data sets originallyin-
troduced by (Ramshaw and Marcus 95). In each
casewehadatraining,developmentandtestset.
For part-of-speech tagging the training set was
sections 0{18 of the treebank, the development
set was sections 19{21 and the nal test set was

was taken from section 15{18, the development
set was section 21, and the test set was section
20. For POS tagging we report the percentage
of correct tags on a test set. For chunking we
report F-measure in recovering bracketings cor-
responding to base NP chunks.
4.2 Features
For POS tagging we used identical features to
those of (Ratnaparkhi 96), the only dierence
being that we did not make the rare word dis-
tinction in table 1 of (Ratnaparkhi 96) (i.e.,
spelling features were included for all words in
training data, and the word itself was used as a
featureregardlessofwhetherthewordwasrare).
The feature set takes into account the previous
tag and previous pairs of tags in the history, as
well as the word being tagged, spelling features
of the words being tagged, and various features
of the words surroundingthe word beingtagged.
In the chunking experiments the input \sen-
tences"includedwordsaswellasparts-of-speech
forthosewordsfromthetagger in(Brill95). Ta-
ble3 showsthefeatures usedinthe experiments.
The chunking problem is represented as a three-
tag task, where the tags are B, I, O for words
beginning a chunk, continuing a chunk, and be-
ing outside a chunk respectively. All chunks be-
gin with a B symbol, regardless of whether the
previous word is tagged O or I.

Figure 4: Results for various methods on the part-of-
speech tagging and chunking tasks on development data.
All scores are error percentages. Numits is the number
of training iterations at which the best score is achieved.
Perc is the perceptron algorithm, ME is the maximum
entropy method. Avg/noavg is the perceptron with or
without averaged parameter vectors. cc=5 means only
features occurring 5 times or more in training are in-
cluded, cc=0 means all features in training are included.
4.3 Results
We applied both maximum-entropy models and
the perceptron algorithm to the two tagging
problems. We tested several variants for each
algorithm on the development set, to gain some
understanding of how the algorithms' perfor-
mance varied with various parameter settings,
and to allow optimization of free parameters so
that the comparison on the nal test set is a fair
one. For both methods, we tried the algorithms
with feature count cut-os set at 0 and 5 (i.e.,
we ran experiments with all features in training
data included, or with all features occurring 5
times or more included { (Ratnaparkhi 96) uses
a count cut-o of 5). In the perceptron algo-
rithm, the numberof iterations T over the train-
ing set was varied, and the method was tested
with both averaged and unaveraged parameter
vectors (i.e., with T;n
s and T;n
s , as dened in
section 2.5, for a variety of values for T). In
the maximum entropy model the number of it-
erations of training using Generalized Iterative
Scaling was varied.
Figure 4 shows results on development data
on the two tasks. The trends are fairly clear:
averaging improves results signicantly for the
perceptron method, as does including all fea-
tures rather than imposing a count cut-o of 5.
In contrast, the ME models' performance suers
when all features are included. The best percep-
tron conguration gives improvements over the
maximum-entropy models in both cases: an im-
provement in F-measure from 92:65% to 93:53%
in chunking, and a reduction from 3:28% to
2:93% error rate in POS tagging. In looking
at the results for dierent numbers of iterations
on development data we found that averaging
not only improves the best result, but also gives
much greater stability of the tagger (the non-
averaged variant has much greater variance in
its scores).
As a nal test, the perceptron and ME tag-
gers were applied to the test sets, with the op-
timal parameter settings on development data.
On POS tagging the perceptron algorithm gave
2.89% error compared to 3.28% error for the
maximum-entropy model (a 11.9% relative re-
duction in error). In NP chunking the percep-
tronalgorithmachieves anF-measureof93.63%,
in contrast to an F-measure of 93.29% for the
ME model (a 5.1% relative reduction in error).
5 Proofs of the Theorems
This section gives proofs of theorems 1 and 2.
The proofs are adapted from proofs for the clas-
sication case in (Freund & Schapire 99).
Proof of Theorem 1: Let 
k be the weights
before the k'th mistake is made. It follows that

1 = 0. Suppose the k'th mistake is made at
the i'th example. Take z to the output proposed
at this example, z = argmaxy2GEN(xi) (xi;y)

k. It follows from the algorithm updates that

k+1 = 
k +(xi;yi) (xi;z). We take inner
products of both sides with the vector U:
U  
k+1 = U  
k
+U (xi;yi) U (xi;z)
 U  
k
+√Ü
wheretheinequalityfollowsbecauseofthe prop-
erty of U assumed in Eq. 3. Because 
1 = 0,
and therefore U  
1 = 0, it follows by induc-
tion on k that for all k, U  
k+1  k√Ü. Be-
cause U  
k+1  jjUjj jj
k+1jj, it follows that
jj
k+1jj  k√Ü.
We also derive an upper bound for jj
k+1jj2:
jj
k+1jj2 = jj
k
jj2 +jj(xi;yi) (xi;z)jj2
+2
k
((xi;yi) (xi;z))
 jj
k
jj2 +R2
where the inequality follows because
jj(xi;yi) (xi;z)jj2  R2 by assump-
tion, and 
k  ((xi;yi) (xi;z))  0 because
z is the highest scoring candidate for xi under
the parameters 
k. It follows by induction that
jj
k+1jj2  kR2.
Combining the bounds jj
k+1jj  k√Ü and
jj
k+1jj2  kR2 gives the result for all k that
k2√Ü2  jj
k+1jj2  kR2 ) k  R2=√Ü2
Proof of Theorem 2: We transformtherep-
resentation (x;y) 2 Rd to a new representation

(x;y) 2 Rd+n as follows. For i = 1:::d de-
ne 
i(x;y) = i(x;y). For j = 1:::n dene

d+j(x;y) =  if (x;y) = (xj;yj), 0 otherwise,
where  is a parameter which is greater than 0.
Similary, say we are given a U;√Ü pair, and cor-
responding values for i as dened above. We
dene a modied parameter vector 
U 2 Rd+n
with 
Ui = Ui for i = 1:::d and 
Ud+j = j=
for j = 1:::n. Under these denitions it can be
veried that
8i;8z 2 GEN(xi); 
U  
(xi;yi) 
U  
(xi;z)  √Ü
8i;8z 2 GEN(xi); jj
(xi;yi) 
(xi;z)jj2  R2 +2
jj
Ujj2 = jjUjj2 +P
i 2
i =2 = 1+D2
U;√Ü=2
It can be seen that the vector 
U=jj
Ujj separates
the data withmargin√Ü=
q
1+D2
U;√Ü=2. By the-
orem 1, this means that the rst pass of the per-
ceptron algorithm with representation 
 makes
at most kmax() = 1
√Ü2 (R2 +2)(1+ D2
U;√Ü
2 ) mis-
takes. But the rst pass of the original algo-
rithm with representation  is identical to the
rst pass of the algorithm with representation

, because the parameter weights for the addi-
tional features 
d+j for j = 1:::n each aect a
singleexampleoftrainingdata, anddonotaect
the classication of test data examples. Thus
the original perceptron algorithm also makes at
most kmax() mistakes on its rst pass over the
trainingdata. Finally,wecanminimizekmax()
with respect to , giving  = p
RDU;√Ü, and
kmax(p
RDU;√Ü) = (R2 +D2
U;√Ü)=√Ü2, implying the
bound in the theorem.
6 Conclusions
We have described new algorithms for tagging,
whose performance guarantees depend on a no-
tion of \separability" of training data exam-
ples. The generic algorithm in gure 2, and
the theorems describing its convergence prop-
erties, could be applied to several other models
in the NLP literature. For example, a weighted
context-free grammar can also be conceptual-
ized as a way of dening GEN,  and 
, so the
weights for generative models such as PCFGs
could be trained using this method.
