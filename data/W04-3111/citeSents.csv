 Our approach to this problem is influenced by the named entity annotation in the Automatic Content Extraction (ACE) project CITATION, in which geopolitical entities can have different roles, such as location or organization,,
 Standardization of Gene references between different texts and between gene synonyms is handled by externally referencing each instance to a standard ontology CITATION,,
 Entities within Prenominal Modifiers While we are for the most part following the Penn Treebank guidelines CITATION, we are modifying them in two important aspects,,

 1 Introduction Work over the last few years in literature data mining for biology has progressed from linguistically unsophisticated models to the adaptation of Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques that use full parsers (CITATION; CITATION) and coreference to extract relations that span multiple sentences (CITATION; Hahn et al,,
, 2002) (For an overview, see CITATION),,
 This is similar to other work in biomedical extraction projects CITATION,,

 While not directly comparable to results such as CITATION, due to the different tag sets and tokenization, they are in the same general range,,
