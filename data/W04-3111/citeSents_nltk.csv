This is similar to other work in biomedical extraction projects CITATION,,
3 Integrated Annotation As has been noted in the literature on biomedical IE (e.g., (CITATION; CITATION)), the same relation can take a number of syntactic forms,,
Our approach to this problem is influenced by the named entity annotation in the Automatic Content Extraction (ACE) project CITATION, in which geopolitical entities can have different roles, such as location or organization,,
While it is difficult to compare taggers that tag different types of entities (e.g., (CITATION; CITATION)), CRFs have been utilized for state-of-the-art results in NP-chunking and gene and protein tagging (CITATION; CITATION) Currently, we are beginning to investigate methods to identify relations over the variation components that are extracted using the entity tagger,,
1 Introduction Work over the last few years in literature data mining for biology has progressed from linguistically unsophisticated models to the adaptation of Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques that use full parsers (CITATION; CITATION) and coreference to extract relations that span multiple sentences (CITATION; Hahn et al., 2002) (For an overview, see CITATION),,
The tagger is based on the implementation of Conditional Random Fields CITATION in the Mallet toolkit CITATION,,
A Propbank has been built on top of the Penn Treebank, and has been used to train semantic taggers, for extracting argument roles for the predicates of interest, regardless of the particular syntactic context.1 Such semantic taggers have been developed by using machine learning techniques trained on the Penn Propbank (CITATION; CITATION; CITATION),,
Standardization of Gene references between different texts and between gene synonyms is handled by externally referencing each instance to a standard ontology CITATION,,
In this case, one component entity point mutations cor2 An influential precursor to this integration is the system described in CITATION,,
Entities within Prenominal Modifiers While we are for the most part following the Penn Treebank guidelines CITATION, we are modifying them in two important aspects,,
We have been influenced in this by previous work in annotation for biomedical information extraction (CITATION; CITATION),,
While not directly comparable to results such as CITATION, due to the different tag sets and tokenization, they are in the same general range.7 The oncology and cyp entity annotation, as well as the treebanking are still being done fully manually, although that will change in the near future,,
