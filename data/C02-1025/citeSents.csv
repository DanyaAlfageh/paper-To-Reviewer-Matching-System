In this section, we try to compare our results with those obtained by IdentiFinder \&apos;97 CITATION, IdentiFinder \&apos;99 (Bikel et al., 1999), and MENE CITATION,,
The secondary classifier in CITATION uses \x0cinformation not just from the current article, but also from the whole test corpus, with an additional feature that indicates if the information comes from the same document or from another document,,
In MUC-6, the best result is achieved by SRA CITATION,,
3 System Description The system described in this paper is similar to the MENE system of CITATION,,
The importance of dictionaries in NERs has been investigated in the literature CITATION,,
These results are achieved by training on the official MUC-6 and MUC-7 training data, which is much less training data than is used by other machine learning systems that worked on the MUC-6 or MUC-7 named entity task (CITATION; Bikel et al., 1999; CITATION),,
Previous work deals with this problem by correcting inconsistencies between the named entity classes assigned to different occurrences of the same entity (CITATION; CITATION),,
IdentiFinder\&apos;s performance in MUC-7 is published in CITATION,,
Attempts have been made to use global information (e.g., the same named entity occurring in different sentences of the same document), but they usually consist of incorporating an additional classifier, which tries to correct the errors in the output of a first NER (CITATION; CITATION),,
MENE without Proteus, however, did not do very well and only achieved an Fmeasure of 84.22% CITATION,,
Even with local features alone, MENERGI outperforms MENE CITATION,,
The secondary classifier in CITATION uses \x0cinformation not just from the current article, but also from the whole test corpus, with an additional feature that indicates if the info,,
On the MUC-6 data, CITATION; 1999) do have some statistics that show how IdentiFinder performs when the training data is reduced,,
The local features used are similar to those used in BBN\&apos;s IdentiFinder (Bikel et al., 1999) or MENE CITATION,,
CITATION have also used a maximum entropy classifier that uses already tagged entities to help tag other entities,,
In MUC-6 and MUC-7, the named entity task is defined as finding the following classes of names: person, organization, location, date, time, money, and percent (CITATION; CITATION) Machine learning systems in MUC-6 and MUC7 achieved accuracy comparable to rule-based systems on the named entity task,,
This enables us to build a high performance NER without using separate classifiers to take care of global consistency or complex formulation on smoothing and backoff models CITATION,,
For example, in predicting if a word belongs to a word class, \x0f is either true or false, and \x02 refers to the surrounding context: \x1e \x0b \x01\x08\x02 \x0b \x0f \t\x1f\x04! \x06 if \x0f = true, previous word = the &quot; otherwise The parameters \x10 \x0b are estimated by a procedure called Generalized Iterative Scaling (GIS) CITATION,,
MUC-7 has also seen hybrids of statistical NERs and hand-coded systems (CITATION; CITATION), notably Mikheev\&apos;s system, which achieved the best performance of 93.39% on the official NE test data,,
MENE (Maximum Entropy Named Entity) CITATION was combined with Proteus (a handcoded system), and came in fourth among all MUC7 participants,,
It is unique, agrees with the maximum-likelihood distribution, and has the exponential form (Della CITATION): \x02\x01 \x0f \x05\x03\x02 \t\x05\x04 \x06 \x07 \x01\x08\x02 \t \t \x0b \x0c\x0f\x0e\x11\x10 \x12\x14\x13\x16\x15\x18\x17\x1a\x19 \x1b\x1d\x1c \x0b \x0b where \x0f refers to the outcome, \x02 the history (or context), and \x07 \x01\x14\x02 \t is a normalization function,,
In CITATION and (Bikel et al., 1999), performance was plotted against training data size to show how performance improves with training data size,,
Since MUC-6, BBN\&apos;s Hidden Markov Model (HMM) based IdentiFinder CITATION has achieved remarkably good performance,,
Even with less training data, MENERGI outperforms Borthwick\&apos;s MENE + reference resolution CITATION,,
