We use a backward Viterbi algorithm CITATION to compute the heuristic function of the forward A search: Heui(hj) = max h 0 i =hjh 0 i HP|h| i P 0 (h 0 |x, ), (8) 843 \x0cwhere h 0 i = hj represents a partial hidden path started from the hidden state hj, and HP|h| i represents all possible partial hidden paths from the position i to the ending position |h |,,
Some approaches rely on k-order generative probabilistic models of paired input sequences and label sequences, such as HMMs (CITATION; CITATION) or multilevel Markov models CITATION,,
In the vision community, the LDCRF model was recently proposed by CITATION, and shown to outperform CRFs, SVMs, and HMMs for visual sequence labeling,,
We implemented an L-BFGS optimizer in C++ by modifying the OWLQN package CITATION developed by Galen Andrew,,
Since these classifiers cannot trade off decisions at different positions against each other CITATION, the best classifier based shallow parsers are forced to resort to heuristic combinations of multiple classifiers,,
Since these classifiers cannot trade off decisions at different positions against each other CITATION, the best classifier based s,,

We observe that the L-BFGS optimizer is slightly faster than CG on LDCRFs (see Figure 3), which echoes the comparison between the L-BFGS and the CG optimizing technique on the CRF model CITATION,,
For details of CG, see CITATION,,
We employ similar predicate sets defined in CITATION,,
To reduce overfitting, we employed an L2 Gaussian weight prior CITATION,,
In this paper, we model latent-dynamics in shallow parsing by extending the Latent-Dynamic Conditional Random Fields (LDCRFs) CITATION, which offer advantages over previ841 \x0cy y y 1 2 m h h h 1 2 m y y y 1 2 m CRF LDCRF x x x 1 2 m x x x 1 2 m Figure 1: Comparison between CRF and LDCRF,,

When the data has distinct sub-structures, models that exploit hidden state variables are advantageous in learning (CITATION; CITATION),,
CRFs use an exponential distribution to model the entire sequence, allowing for non-local dependencies between states and observations CITATION,,

CITATION achieved an F-measure of 94.29% by using a CRF model,,
To accommodate multiple overlapping features on observations, some other approaches view the sequence labeling problem as a sequence of classification problems, including support vector machines (SVMs) CITATION and a variety of other classifiers (CITATION; CITATION; CITATION),,
As for numerical optimization (CITATION; CITATION), we performed gradient decent with the Limited-Memory BFGS (L-BFGS) optimization technique CITATION,,
To guarantee HPn is exact in our BLP inference, an admissible heuristic function should be used in A search CITATION,,
As for the task of shallow parsing, CRFs also outperform many other state-of-the-art models (CITATION; CITATION),,
hn} over hidden states are efficiently produced by using A search CITATION, and the corresponding probabilities of hidden paths P(hi|x, ) are gained,,
Since the CRF model is one of the successful models in sequential labeling tasks (CITATION; CITATION; CITATION), in this section, we also compare LDCRFs with CRFs,,
By employing a multi-model combination approach, CITATION also achieved a good performance,,
Nevertheless, since testing the significance of shallow parsers F-measures is tricky, individual labeling accuracy provides a more convenient basis for statistical significance tests CITATION,,
One such test is the McNemar test on paired observations CITATION,,
