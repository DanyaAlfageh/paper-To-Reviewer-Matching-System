 CRFs using this technique have been shown to be very successful at the task of Chinese word segmentation (CWS), starting with the model of CITATION,,
 In the Second International Chinese Word Segmentation Bakeoff CITATION, two of the highest scoring systems in the closed track competition were based on a CRF model,,
 (CITATION; CITATION) While the CRF is quite effective compared with other models designed for CWS, one wonders whether it may be limited by its restrictive independence assumptions on non-adjacent labels: an order-M CRF satisfies the order-M Markov assumption that, globally conditioned on the input sequence, each label is independent of all other labels given the M labels to its left and right,,
 For example, CITATION uses a discriminative classifier for choosing among the top N parse trees output by a generative baseline model, and uses the log-probability of a parse according to the baseline model as a feature in the reranker,,
 Similarly, the machine translation system of Och and Ney uses log-probabilities of phrasal translations and other events as features in a log-linear model (CITATION; CITATION),,

 There have not been a large number of studies using the semi-CRF, but the few that have been done found only marginal improvements over pure CRF systems (CITATION; CITATION; Daume III and Marcu, 2005),,
for these tasks are the conditional random field (CRFs) CITATION and the semi-Markov conditional random field (semi-CRF) CITATION,,

 The data used was the Microsoft Research Beijing corpus from the Second International Chinese Word Segmentation Bakeoff CITATION, and we used the same train/test split used in the competition,,
 We did not explicitly test the utility of CRF-type features for improving recall on out-of-vocabulary items, but we note that in the Bakeoff, the model of CITATION, which was very similar to our CRF-only system (only containing a few more feature templates), was consistently among the best performing systems in terms of test OOV recall CITATION,,

 Despite this, the only work of which we are aware exploring the use of a semi-Markov CRF for Chinese word segmentation did not find significant gains over the standard CRF CITATION,,
 Indeed, neither CITATION nor CITATION nor any other system using a semi-Markov CRF on any task has included this type of feature to our knowledge,,

 Similarly, the machine translation system of Och and Ney uses log-probabilities of phrasal translations and other events as features in a log-linear model (CITATION; CITATION),,
 There are many reasons for incorporating these types of features, including the desire to combine the higher accuracy of a discriminative model with the simple parameter estimation and inference of a generative one, and also the fact that generative models are more robust in data sparse scenarios CITATION,,

4 Generative Features in a Discriminative Model When using the output of a generative model as a feature in a discriminative model, CITATION provide a justification for the use of log conditional odds as opposed to log-probability: they show that using log conditional odds as features in a logistic regression model is equivalent to discriminatively training weights for the features of a Nave Bayes classifier to maximize conditional likelihood,,
