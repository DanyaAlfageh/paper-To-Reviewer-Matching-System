 This issue can be seen across different parsing models (CITATION; CITATION; CITATION; CITATIONb),,
 Recently, Daume III (2007) and CITATION showed techniques for training models that attempt to separate domainspecific and general properties,,

 This would combine our work with (Daume III, 2007; CITATION),,
 We have focused on the CITATION parser, the first stage in the two stage CITATION reranking parser,,
 Applying our methods to other generative parsers (such as (Collins, 1999; CITATION)) is trivial, but it is less clear how our methods can be applied to the discriminative reranker component of the two stage parser,,

 Our system is similar to CITATION in that both use regression to predict f-scores and some of the features are related,,
