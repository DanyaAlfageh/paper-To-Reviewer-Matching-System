We use a backward Viterbi algorithm CITATION to compute the heuristic function of the forward A search: Heui(hj) = max h 0 i =hjh 0 i HP|h| i P 0 (h 0 |x, ), (8) 843 \x0cwhere h 0 i = hj represents a partial hidden path started from the hidden state hj, and HP|h| i represents all possible partial hidden paths from the position i to the ending position |h |,,0

We implemented an L-BFGS optimizer in C++ by modifying the OWLQN package CITATION developed by Galen Andrew,,0
Since these classifiers cannot trade off decisions at different positions against each other CITATION, the best classifier based shallow parsers are forced to resort to heuristic combinations of multiple classifiers,,0
