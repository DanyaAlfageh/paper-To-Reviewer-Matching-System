CITATION and Yoshioka (2004) evaluate the relevance (similarity) between any two sentences first,,0
Probabilistic Support Vector Machine (PSVM) is employed as supervised learning CITATION, while the co-training of PSVM and Naive Bayesian Classifier (NBC) is used for semi-supervised learning,,0
An automatic evaluation package, i.e., ROUGE CITATION is employed to evaluate the summarization performance,,0
The GATE system CITATION is used to tag named entities, which are categorized as &lt;Person&gt;, &lt;Organization&gt;, &lt;Location&gt; and &lt;Date&gt;,,0
CITATION parsed documents as rhetorical trees and identified important sentences based on the trees,,0
CITATION conducted preliminary research on this problem, but event features were not considered,,0
CITATION constructed lexical chains and extracted s,,0
Literature (CITATION; Collins, 1999) has suggested that unlabeled data can be exploited together with labeled data by co-training two classifiers,,0
Recently, content features were also well studied, including centroid (Radev et al., 2004), signature terms CITATION and high frequency words (Nenkova e t al., 2006),,0
Two kinds of summarization approaches were suggested in the past, i.e., extractive (Radev et al., 2004; CITATION) and abstractive summarization (Dejong, 1978),,0
CITATION trained two classifiers of same type on different features, and CITATION trained two classifiers of different types,,0
CITATION proposed co-training approach to exploit labeled and unlabeled data,,0
CITATION later reported that high frequency words were crucial in reflecting the focus of the document,,0
An event map is then built based on event instances or concepts (Wu , 2006; CITATION),,0
Recent literature (CITATION; Collins, 199) has suggested that co-training techniques reduce the amount of labeled data,,0
Recently, semi-structure events (Filatovia and Hatzivassiloglou, 2004; CITATION; CITATION) have been investigated by many researchers as they balanced document repre,,0
CITATION constructed lexical chains and extracted strong chains in summaries,,0
A number of successful studies emerged thereafter for other natural language processing tasks, such as text classification CITATION, noun phrase chunking CITATION, parsing CITATION and reference or relation resolution (CITATION; CITATION),,0
