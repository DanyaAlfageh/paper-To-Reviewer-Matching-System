We are aware that in particular prosodic information may be of help for tasks such as the detection of sentence boundaries, speech acts, or topic boundaries (CITATION; Shriberg et al., 1998; Stolcke et al., 2000), but the investigation of the integration of this additional source of informationis beyond the scope of this paper and left f,,0
Furthermore, a POS based shallow chunk parser CITATION is used to \x0clter out likely candidates for incomplete clauses due to speech repair or interruption by the other speaker,,0

Recent work on spoken language summarization in unrestricted domains has focused almost exclusively on Broadcast News, mostly due to the spoken language track of recent TREC evaluations (CITATION; CITATION),,0
1 Introduction Summarization of written documents has recently been a focus for much research in NLP (e.g., (Mani and Maybury, 1997; AAAI, 1998; CITATION; CITATION), to name some of the major events in this \x0celd in the past few years),,1
e proved to be comparable with the results in the cited papers (F1 &gt; 0:85, error < 0:05).2 For several of the clean-up \x0clter\&apos;s components, we make use of Brill\&apos;s POS tagger CITATION,,1
CITATION describe a Meeting Browser where summaries can be generated using technology established for written texts,,0
That way we can reduce the likelihood of extracting passages with a larger amount of word misrecognitions (Zechner and CITATION),,0
This is done using a TextTiling approach, adapted from CITATION (section 6),,1
Similar to other experiments in the summarizationliterature CITATION, we \x0cnd a wide performance variation across di\x0berent texts,,1
Since we only use shallow methods for textual analysis that do not generate a dependency structure, we cannot use complex methods for text reduction as described, e.g., in CITATION,,0
We are aware that in particular prosodic information may be of help for tasks such as the detection of sentence boundaries, speech acts, or topic boundaries (CITATION; Shriberg et al., 1998; Stolcke et al., 2000), but the investigation of the integration of this additional source of informationis beyond the scope of this paper and left for future work,,1
[1.0,1.1) CITATION.4 Table 4 shows the results from these experiments,,1
Following (CITATION; CITATION) who use TextTiling CITATION for their summarization systems of written text, we adapted this algorithm (its block comparison version) for speech data: we choose turns to be minimal units and compute block similarity between blocks of k turns every d turns,,1

This interface also integrates the output of a speech recognizer CITATION, and can display a wide variety of information about a conversation, including speech acts, dialogue games, and emotions,,0
For term-weighting, tf*idf -inspired formulae CITATION are used to emphasize words which are in the \\middle range"" of frequency in the dialogue and do not appear in a stop list.3 For turn-ranking, we use a version of the ,,1
9 User Interface and System Performance Since we want to enable interactive summarization which allows a user to browse through a dialogue quickly to search for information he is interested in, we have integrated our summarization system into a JAVA-based graphical user interface (\\Meeting Browser"") CITATION,,0
hods for textual analysis that do not generate a dependency structure, we cannot use complex methods for text reduction as described, e.g., in CITATION,,0
For English, we use a modi\x0ced version of Brill\&apos;s original tagset, and the tagger was adapted andretrained for spoken language corpora (Callhome and Switchboard) CITATION,,0
While CITATION use n-gram models for this task, and (Gavald\x12 a et al., 1997) use neural networks, we decided to use a rule-based approach (using word and POS information), whose performance proved to be comparable with the results in the cited papers (F1 &gt; 0:85, error < 0:05).2 For several of the clean-up \x0clter\&apos;s components, we make use of Brill\&apos;s POS tagger CITATION,,0
For term-weighting, tf*idf -inspired formulae CITATION are used to emphasize words which are in the \\middle range"" of frequency in the dialogue and do not appear in a stop list.3 For turn-ranking, we use a version of the \\maximal marginal relevance"" (MMR) algorithm (Carbonell and CITATION), where emphasis is given to turns which contain many highly weighted terms for the current segment (\\salience"") and are su\x0eciently dissimilar to previously ranked turns (to minimize redundancy),,0
These results, albeit achieved on a quite di\x0berent text genre, are well in line with the results in CITATION who reports an absolute improvement of about 20% over a random baseline for seen data,,1
We address these two main questions in this study: (i) how fast can information be identi\x0ced using different types of summaries? (ii) how accurately is the information preserved, comparing di\x0berent types of summaries? We did not only ask the user \ arrow"" questions for a speci\x0cc piece of information |along the lines of the Q-A-evaluation part of the SUMMAC conference CITATION |but also very \\global"", non-speci\x0cc questions, tied to a particular (topical) segment of the dialogue,,0
Summarization of dialogues within limited domains has been attempted within the context of the Verbmobil project (\\protocol generation"", CITATION) or by SRI\&apos;s MIMI summarizer CITATION,,0
CITATION go one step further and incorporate knowledge from the speech recognizer (con\x0cdence scores) into their summarization system, as well,,0
This interface also integrates the output of a speech recognizer CITATION, and can display a wide variety of information about,,1
We thus have recently developed a new word-based method for annotation and evaluation of spontaneous speech CITATION,,0
