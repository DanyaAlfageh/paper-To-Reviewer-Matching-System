Like the data used by CITATION, this data was retagged by the Brill tagger in order to obtain realistic part-of-speech (POS) tags5,,1

Tjong Kim Sang CITATION outlines alternative versions of this tagging representation,,0
(1998) and CITATION show that part-of-speech tagger performance can be improved by combining di\x0berent taggers,,1
The Open predictor is learned using SNoW (CITATION; CITATION) as a function of features that utilize words and POS tags in the sentence and, given a new sentence, will predict for each word whether it is the \x0crst word in the phrase or not,,1
The main data set consist of four sections of the Wall Street Journal (WSJ) part of the Penn Treebank CITATION as training material (sections 15-18, 211727 tokens) and one section as test material (section 20, 47377 tokens)1,,1
The approach we have chosen here is the same as in Tjong Kim Sang CITATION: generate di\x0berent variants of the task by using di\x0berent representations of the output (IOB1, IOB2, IOE1, IOE2 and O+C),,1
For the four IO representations we have used a second processing stage which used a smaller context but which included information about the IO tags predicted by the \x0crst processing phase (Tjong Kim CITATION),,0
This grammar is then used by the CASS parser CITATION,,0
We expect the systems which use this combination phase to perform better than their individual members (Tjong Kim CITATION),,0
(1999) but instead used the strategy outlined in Tjong Kim Sang CITATION: regard only the shortest possible phrases between candidate open and close brackets as base noun phrases,,1
