Its real usefulness comes, as shown in CITATION, when we move from the notion of a feature chain to a feature tree,,1
1 Introduction Parsing sentences using statistical information gathered from a treebank was first examined a decade ago in CITATION and is by now a fairly well-studied problem (CITATION, CITATION, CITATION),,0

Other tags have explicit caveats that, however welljustified, proved difficult to remember for the taggers--for instance, there are 37 instances of a PP being tagged with LGS (logical subject) in spite of the guidelines specifically saying, \'[LGS] attaches to the NP object of by and not to the PP node itself.\' CITATION Each mistagging in the test corpus can cause up to two spurious errors, one in precision and one in recall,,0
We have divided them into four categories (given in figure 2) based on those in the bracketing guidelines CITATION,,1
This is concordant with the usage in the maximum entropy literature CITATION,,0
