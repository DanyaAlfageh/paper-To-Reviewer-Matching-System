Recent work has explored the use of hidden
Markov models for unsupervised discourse
and conversation modeling, where each seg-
ment or block of text such as a message in a
conversation is associated with a hidden state
in a sequence. We extend this approach to al-
low each block of text to be a mixture of mul-
tiple classes. Under our model, the probability
of a class in a text block is a log-linear func-
tion of the classes in the previous block. We
show that this model performs well at predic-
tive tasks on two conversation data sets, im-
proving thread reconstruction accuracy by up
to 15 percentage points over a standard HMM.
Additionally, we show quantitatively that the
induced word clusters correspond to speech
acts more closely than baseline models.

1 Introduction
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.998956081632653">
The proliferation of social media in recent years has
lead to an increased use of informal Web data in
the language processing community. With this ris-
ing interest in social domains, it is natural to con-
sider models which explicitly incorporate the con-
versational patterns of social text. Compared to the
naive approach of treating conversations as flat doc-
uments, models which include conversation struc-
ture have been shown to improve tasks such as fo-
rum search (Elsas and Carbonell, 2009; Seo et al.,
2009), question answering and expert finding (Xu et
al., 2008; Wang et al., 2011a), and interpersonal re-
lationship identification (Diehl et al., 2007).
While conversational features may be important,
Web-derived corpora are not always annotated with
this information, and the nature of conversations on
the Web can vary wildly across domains and venues.
Addressing these concerns, there has been recent
work with unsupervised models of Web conversa-
tions based on hidden Markov models (Ritter et al.,
2010), where each state corresponds to a conversa-
tional class or act. Unlike more traditional uses of
HMMs in which a single token is emitted per time
step, HMM emissions in conversations correspond
to entire blocks of text, such that an entire message
is generated at each step. Because each time step is
associated with a block of variables, we refer to this
type of HMM as a block HMM (Fig. 1a).
While block HMMs offer a concise model of
inter-message structure, they have the limitation that
each text block (message) belongs to exactly one
class. Many modern generative models of text, in
contrast, allow documents to contain many latent
classes. For example, topic models such as Latent
Dirichlet Allocation (LDA) (Blei et al., 2003) as-
sume each document has its own distribution over
multiple classes (often called topics). For many
predictive tasks, topic models outperform single-
class generative models such as Naive Bayes. These
properties could similarly be desirable in conversa-
tion modeling. An email might contain a request,
a question, and an answer to a previous question
three distinct dialog acts within a single message.
This motivates the desire to allow a message to be a
mixture of classes.
In this paper, we introduce a new type of model
which combines the functionality of topic models,
which posit latent class assignments to each individ-
ual token, with Markovian sequence models, which

govern the transitions between text blocks in a se-
quence. We generalize the block HMM approach so
that there is no longer a one-to-one correspondence
between states in the Markov chain and latent dis-
course classes. Instead, we allow a state in the HMM
to correspond to a mixture of many classes: we re-
fer to this family of models as mixed membership
Markov models (M4). Instead of defining explicit
transition probabilities from one class to another as
in a traditional HMM, we define the distribution over
classes as a function of the entire histogram of class
assignments of the previous text segment. We define
our model using the same number of parameters as
a standard HMM (2), and we present a straightfor-
ward approximate inference algorithm (3).
While we introduce a general model, we will fo-
cus on the task of unsupervised conversation model-
ing. Specifically, we build off the Bayesian block
HMMs used by Ritter et al. (2010) for modeling
Twitter conversations, which will be our primary
baseline. After discussing related work (4), we
present experimental results on a set of Twitter con-
versations as well as a set of threads from CNET
discussion forums (5). We show that M4 increases
thread reconstruction accuracy by up to 15% com-
pared to the HMM of Ritter et al. (2010), and we
reduce variation of information against speech act
annotations by an average of 18% from HMM and
LDA baselines. To the best of our knowledge, this
work is the first attempt to quantitatively compare
unsupervised models against gold standard speech
act annotations.

2 M4
: Mixed Membership Markov Models
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.998383681818182">
In this section, we extend the block HMM by intro-
ducing mixed membership Markov models (M4).
Under the block HMM, as utilized by Ritter et al.
(2010), messages in a conversation flow according to
a Markov process, where the words of messages are
generated according to language models associated
with a state in a hidden Markov model. The intu-
ition is that HMM states should correspond to some
notion of a conversation act such as QUESTION or
ANSWER. The intuition is the same under M4, but
now each token in a message is given its own class
assignment, according to a class distribution for that
particular message. A messages class distribution
depends on the class assignments of the previous
message, yielding a model that retains sequential de-
pendencies between messages, while allowing for
finer grained class allocation than the block HMM.
Modeling messages (or more generally, text blocks)
as a mixture of multiple classes rather than a single
class gives rise to the mixed membership property.
In the subsections below, we formalize and ana-
lyze this new model.

2.1 Structure Assumptions
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999176333333333">
We first define the discourse structure and termi-
nology we will be assuming. The discourse struc-
ture is a directed graph, where nodes correspond to
segments of a document (which we will refer to as
blocks of text), and the edges define the dependen-
cies between them.
</bodyText>
<page confidence="0.994377">

<bodyText confidence="0.999695047619047">
\x0cThus, a text block is a set of tokens, while a doc-
ument consists of the discourse graph and all blocks
associated with it. In the context of modeling con-
versation threads, which will be the focus of our ex-
periments later, we will assume a block corresponds
to a single message in a thread. The parent of a mes-
sage m is the message to which it is a response; if
a message is not in response to anything in particu-
lar, then it has no parent. Any replies to the message
m are the children of m. The thread as a whole is
called a document.
The discourse graph should be acyclic. A directed
acyclic graph (DAG) offers a flexible representation
of discourse (Rose et al., 1995), but for simplic-
ity, we will restrict this and assume that each sub-
graph is a tree; i.e. no message has multiple parents.
The graph as a whole may be a forest: for example,
someone could write a new message in a conversa-
tion that is not directly in reply to any previous mes-
sage, so this message would not have any parents,
and would form the root of a new tree in the forest.

2.2 Generative Story
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.99916475">
Extending the block HMM, latent classes in M4 are
now associated with each individual token, rather
than one class for an entire block. The key differ-
ence between the generative process behind M4 and
the block HMM is that the transition distributions
are defined with a log-linear model, which uses class
assignments in a block as features to define the dis-
tribution over classes for the children of that block.
Put another way, a state in M4 corresponds to a class
histogram, and transitions between states are func-
tions of the log-linear parameters.
Given a block b, we will use the notation b to de-
note the blocks feature vector, which consists of the
histogram of latent class assignments for the tokens
of b.1 There are K classes. Additionally, we assume
each feature vector has an extra cell containing an
indicator denoting whether the block has no parent
this allows us to learn transitions from a start
state. We also include a bias feature that is always
1, to learn a default weight for each class. There
</bodyText>

<bodyText confidence="0.997052733333333">
One could also use other functions of the class histograms
rather than the raw counts themselves. For example, we experi-
mented with binary indicator features (i.e. does class k appear
anywhere in block b?), but this performed consistently worse
in early experiments, and we do not consider this further.
are thus K + 2 features which are used to predict
the probability of each of the K classes. The fea-
tures are weighted by transition parameters, denoted
. The random variable z denotes a latent class, and
z is a discrete distribution over word types that
is, each class is associated with a unigram language
model. The transition distribution over classes is de-
noted , which is given in terms of and the feature
vector of the parent block.
Under this model, a corpus D is generated by:

<bodyText confidence="0.995577954545455">
For each block of text in a document (e.g. each
message in a conversation), the distribution over
classes is computed as a function of the feature
vector of the blocks parent and the transition pa-
rameters (feature weights) . Each jk has an intu-
itive interpretation: a positive value means that the
occurrence of class k in a parent block increases the
probability that j will appear in the next block, while
a negative value reduces this probability.
The observed words of each block are generated
by repeatedly sampling classes from the blocks dis-
tribution , and for each sampled class z, a single
word is sampled from the class-specific distribution
over words z. In contrast, under the block HMM, a
class z is sampled once from the transition distribu-
tion, and words are repeatedly sampled from z.
We place a symmetric Dirichlet prior on each
with concentration parameter , which smoothes the
word distributions, and we place a 0-mean Gaussian
prior on each parameter, which acts as a regular-
izer. The graphical diagram is shown in Figure 1

2.3 Discussion
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.995046555555555">
Like the block HMM, M4 is a type of HMM. A latent
sequence under M4 forms a Markov chain in which
a state corresponds to a histogram of classes. (For
simplicity, we are ignoring the extra features of the
start state indicator and bias in this discussion.) If
we assume a priori that the length of a block is un-
bounded, then this state space is NK where 0 N.
The probability of transitioning from a state b to an-
other state b NK is:

block has N tokens,2 and (b) is the transition dis-
tribution given a vector b. This follows from the
generative story defined above, with an additional
step of generating the number of tokens N from the
distribution .
We currently define a block bs distribution b in
terms of the discrete feature vector a given by its
parent a. We could have instead made b a func-
tion of the parents distribution a this would lead
to a model that assumes a dynamical system over a
continuous space rather than a Markov chain. How-
ever, as a generative story we believe it makes more
sense for a blocks distribution to depend on the ac-
tual class values which are emitted by the parent.
Similar arguments are made by Blei and Mcauliffe
(2007) when designing supervised topic models.
Under a block HMM with one class per block,
there are K states corresponding to the K classes,
requiring KK parameters to define the transition
matrix. Under M4, there is a countably infinite num-
ber of states, but the transitions are still defined by
KK parameters (ignoring extra features). M4 thus
utilizes a larger state space without increasing the
number of free parameters.

To explore the posterior distribution over latent

we marginalize out each word multinomial and

W is the vocabulary size. a is the parent block of b,
and C is the set of bs children. b is the feature vector
corresponding to block b (i.e. the class histogram
plus the bias feature), where the histogram includes
the incremented count of the candidate class k.
This sampling distribution is very similar to that
of LDA (Griffiths and Steyvers, 2004), but the distri-
bution over topics is now a function of the previ-
ous block, which gives the leftmost term. The right-
most term is a result of the dependency of the child
blocks (C) on the class assignments of b.
Due to the rightmost term, the complexity of com-
puting the sampling distribution is quadratic in the
number of classes, rather than the linear complexity
of a single-class HMM. Our assumption is that the
number of sequence-dependent classes (e.g. speech
acts or discourse states) will be reasonably small. If
it is desired to have a large number of latent topics as
is common in LDA, this model could be combined
with a standard topic model without sequential de-
pendencies, as explored by Ritter et al. (2010).

Hidden Markov models have a recent history as sim-
ple models of document structure. Stolcke et al.
(2000) used HMMs as a general model of discourse
with an application to speech acts (or dialog acts)
in conversations. Barzilay and Lee (2004) applied
HMMs as an unsupervised model of discourse. This
work used HMMs to model the progression of sen-
tences in articles, and was shown to be useful for or-
dering sentences and generating summaries of news
articles. More recently, Wang et al. (2011b) exper-
imented with similar tasks using a related HMM-
based model called the Structural Topic Model.
Unsupervised HMMs were applied to conversa-
tional data by Ritter et al. (2010) who experimented
with Twitter conversations. The authors also experi-
mented with incorporating a topic model on top of
the HMM to distinguish speech acts from topical
clusters, with mixed results. Joty et al. (2011) ex-
tended this work by enriching the emission distribu-
tions and using additional features such as speaker
and position information. An approach to unsuper-
vised discourse modeling that does not use HMMs is

pling iteration corresponds to a stochastic E-step.
the latent permutation model of Chen et al. (2009).
This model assumes each segment (e.g. paragraph)
in a document is associated with a latent class or
topic, and the ordering of topics within a document
is modeled as a deviation from some canonical or-
dering.
Extensions to the block HMM have incorpo-
rated mixed membership properties within blocks,
notably the Markov Clustering Topic Model
(Hospedales et al., 2009), which allows each HMM
state to be associated with its own distribution over
topics in a topic model. Like the block HMM, this
still assumes a relatively small number of HMM
states, but with an extra layer of latent variables be-
fore the observations are emitted. This is more re-
strictive than the unbounded state space of M4.
Decoupling HMM states from latent classes was
considered by Beal et al. (1997) with the Factorial
HMM, which uses factorized state representations.
The Factorial HMM is most often used to model in-
dependent Markov chains, whereas M4 has a dense
graphical model topology: the probability of each
of the latent classes depends on the counts of all of
the classes in the previous block. The trick in M4
is to define the transition matrix via a function of
a limited number of parameters, allowing tractable
inference in a model with arbitrarily many states.
In topic models, log-linear formulations of la-
tent class distributions4 are utilized in correlated
topic models (Blei and Lafferty, 2007) as a means
of incorporating covariance structure among topic
probabilities. Applying log-linear regression to po-
tentially many features was combined with LDA
by Mimno and McCallum (2008), who model the
Dirichlet prior over topics as a function of document
features. In M4, such features would correspond to
the class histograms of previous blocks, introducing
additional dependencies between documents.
One topic model that imposes sequential depen-
dencies between documents is Sequential LDA (Du
et al., 2010), which models a document as a se-
quence of segments (such as paragraphs) governed
by a Pitman-Yor process, in which the latent topic
distribution of one segment serves as the base dis-
tribution for the next segment. This is in the spirit

it likely to appear in the next. In contrast, we wish
to learn arbitrary transitions, both positive and neg-
ative, between the latent classes.

these two properties.

<bodyText confidence="0.996974894736842">
We begin with standard measures of the perplex-
ity of held-out data. For these experiments, we
train on 75% of the data, and test on the remaining
25%. We run the sampler for 500 iterations using the
word distributions and transition parameters learned
during training; we compute the average perplexity
from the final ten sampling iterations.
Results for different numbers of classes are shown
in Table 1. These results demonstrate the advan-
tage of models with the mixed membership property.
Although LDA outperforms both sequence models,
this is be expected. Each blocks topic distribution
is stochastically generated with LDA, whereas in the
two sequence models, the distribution over classes
is simply a deterministic function of the previous
block. This allows LDA to infer parameters that fit
the data more tightly. Comparing only the two se-
quence models, we find that M4 does significantly
better than BHMM in all cases with p &amp;lt; 0.05.

5.5.2 Thread Reconstruction
</subsubsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.99670419047619">
A natural predictive task of the sequence models
is to reconstruct the discourse graph of a document
where the structure is unknown. In the conversa-
tion domain, this corresponds to the task of thread
reconstruction (Yeh and Harnly, 2006; Wang et al.,
2011c). Given only a flat structure, can we recover
the reply structure of messages in the conversation?
Previous work with BHMM found the optimal
structure by computing the likelihood of all permu-
tations of a thread or sequence (Ritter et al., 2010;
Wang et al., 2011b). We take a more practical ap-
proach and find the optimal structure as part of our
inference procedure. We do this by treating the par-
ent of each block as a hidden variable to be inferred.
The parent of block b is the random variable rb, and
we alternate between sampling values of the latent
classes z and the parents r. The sampling distri-
butions are annealed, as a search technique to find
the best configuration of assignments (Finkel et al.,
2005). At temperature , we sample a blocks parent
according to:

<bodyText confidence="0.992846857142857">
\x0cFor each conversation thread, any message is a
candidate for the parent of block b (except b itself)
including the dummy start block.
As before, we train on 75% of the data, and run
this experiment on the remaining 25%. We run the
sampler for 500 iterations, cooling by 1% after
each iteration, where (0) = 1. We measure accu-
racy as the percentage of blocks whose assignment
for rb matches the true parent. For each fold, we
run this estimation procedure from five random ini-
tializations and average the results. Like Ritter et al.
(2010), we do not enforce temporal constraints in the
thread structure for this experiment. We are purely
evaluating the predictive abilities of the model rather
than its performance in a full-fledged reconstruction
setup, which would require richer features beyond
the scope of this paper.
Figure 2 shows results comparing M4 against
BHMM. Because all blocks are independent under
LDA, it cannot be used in this experiment; using
LDA would amount to a random baseline.
We plot the distribution of results from vari-
ous samples and various numbers of classes in
{5, . . . , 25}. Most of the variance is across folds
and samples; we find that there is not a strong trend
in accuracy as a function of the number of classes.
This suggests that most of the sequence predictions
are carried by a small subset of the classes.
On average, M4 outperforms BHMM by more
than 15 points on the CNET corpus. M4 is also bet-
ter on the Twitter corpus, but the difference is not so
stark. This seems to confirm our intuition that the
advantage of M4 over BHMM is greater when the
blocks are longer; tweets may be short enough that
the single-class assumption is not as limiting.

Thus far, we have investigated the predictive
power of the model, but we would also like to deter-
mine if the inferred clusters correspond to human-
interpretible classes. In the case of conversation
data, our hope is that some of the latent classes
represent speech acts or dialog acts (Searle, 1975).
While there is a body of work in supervised speech
act classification (Cohen et al., 2004; Bangalore et

proaches.
The CNET corpus is annotated with twelve
speech act classes: QUESTION and ANSWER, which
are both broken down into multiple sub-classes, as
well as RESOLUTION, REPRODUCTION, and OTHER
(Kim et al., 2010). We would like to quantitatively
measure how closely the latent states induced by our
model match these annotations.7
We can measure this with variation of informa-
tion (Meila, 2003), which has been used in recent
years for unsupervised evaluation, e.g. in part-of-
speech clustering (Goldwater and Griffiths, 2007).
Given two sets of variable assignments z and z0, the
variation of information is defined as H(Z|Z0) +
H(Z0|Z). In other words, given one clustering, how
much uncertainty do we have about the other? Re-
sults are shown in Figure 3: a lower value corre-
sponds to higher similarity.
On the CNET corpus, M4 outperforms both base-
lines in all cases by a very significant margin. Qual-
itatively, we see clusters and transition parameters
that make sense. For example, the class with top
words {i, my, have, computer, am, ?, tried, help}
is most likely to begin a thread (with = +1.94)
and appears to describe questions or requests for

Some messages have multiple labels. Since messages are
not annotated at finer granularities, we handle this by simply
duplicating such messages, once per label, and measuring clus-
tering performance on this expanded set of labeled data which
now has one label per token.

help. The class is not likely to be followed by itself
( = 0.32) but is likely to be followed by the class
with words {you, your, /, com, ., http, windows}
(with = +1.38).
The Twitter corpus does not have speech act an-
notations, so we offer example output in Figure 4.
We again see patterns that we might expect to find in
social media conversations, and some classes appear
to correspond to speech acts such a declarations, per-
sonal questions, and replies. For example, the class
in the center of the figure has words like you and but
which suggests it is used in reply to other messages,
and indeed we see that it has a positive weight of
following almost every class, but a negative weight
for actually starting a thread. Conversely, the class
containing URLs (which corresponds to the act of
sharing news or media) is likely to begin a thread,
but is not likely to follow other classes except itself.
How well unsupervised models can truly capture
speech acts is an open question. Much as LDA
topics do not always correspond to what humans
would judge to be semantic classes (Chang et al.,
2009), the conversation classes inferred by unsu-
pervised sequence models are similarly unlikely to
be a perfect fit to human-assigned classes. Never-
theless, these results suggest M4 is a step forward.
Our model provides a framework for defining inter-
message transitions as functions of multiple classes,
which will be a desirable property for many corpora.

6 Conclusion
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.989208476190476">
We have presented mixed membership Markov
models (M4), which extend the simple HMM ap-
proach to discourse modeling by positing class as-
signments at the level of individual tokens. This al-
lows blocks of text to belong to potentially multiple
classes, a property that relates M4 to topic models.
This type of model can be viewed as an HMM with
an expanded state space, but because the transition
probabilities are a function of a small number of pa-
rameters, the output remains human-interpretible.
M4 can be taken as a general family of models and
can be readily extended. In this work, we focused
on introducing a model of inter-message structure,
but certainly more sophisticated models of intra-
message structure beyond unigram language mod-
els could be incorporated into M4. Standard topic
model extensions such as n-gram models (Wallach,
2006) can straightforwardly be applied here, and in-
deed we already applied such an extension by in-
corporating background distributions in 5.3. For
conversational data, it could make sense to segment

<bodyText confidence="0.998725363636364">
\x0cmessages (e.g. into sentences) and constraint each
segment to belong to one class or speech act; modi-
fications along these lines have been applied to topic
models as well (Gruber et al., 2007). While we have
focused on conversation modeling, M4 is a general
probabilistic model that could be applied to other
discourse applications, for example modeling sen-
tences or paragraphs in articles rather than messages
in conversations; it could also be applied to data be-
yond text.
Compared to a Bayesian block HMM, M4 per-
forms much better at a variety of tasks. A draw-
back is that the time complexity of inference as pre-
sented here is quadratic in the number of classes
rather than linear. Improving this may be the subject
of future research. Another potential avenue of fu-
ture work is to model transitions such that a Dirichlet
prior for the class distribution of a block, rather than
the class distribution itself, depends on the previous
class assignments. This would yield a model that
more closely resembles LDA, but with topic priors
that encode sequence information.

We extend this approach to allow each block of text to be a mixture of multiple classes. Under our model, the probability of a class in a text block is a log-linear function of the classes in the previous block. We show that this model performs well at predictive tasks on two conversation data sets, improving thread reconstruction accuracy by up to 15 percentage points over a standard HMM.

This work used HMMs to model the progression of sentences in articles, and was shown to be useful for ordering sentences and generating summaries of news articles. More recently, Wang et al.

Extensions to the block HMM have incorporated mixed membership properties within blocks, notably the Markov Clustering Topic Model (Hospedales et al., 2009), which allows each HMM state to be associated with its own distribution over topics in a topic model. Like the block HMM, this still assumes a relatively small number of HMM states, but with an extra layer of latent variables before the observations are emitted. This is more restrictive than the unbounded state space of M4. Decoupling HMM states from latent classes was considered by Beal et al. (1997) with the Factorial HMM, which uses factorized state representations. The Factorial HMM is most often used to model independent Markov chains, whereas M4 has a dense graphical model topology: the probability of each of the latent classes depends on the counts of all of the classes in the previous block. The trick in M4 is to define the transition matrix via a function of a limited number of parameters, allowing tractable inference in a model with arbitrarily many states.

Similar arguments are made by Blei and Mcauliffe (2007) when designing supervised topic models. Under a block HMM with one class per block, there are K states corresponding to the K classes, requiring KK parameters to define the transition matrix. Under M4, there is a countably infinite number of states, but the transitions are still defined by KK parameters (ignoring extra features).

Because each time step is associated with a block of variables, we refer to this type of HMM as a block HMM (Fig. 1a). While block HMMs offer a concise model of inter-message structure, they have the limitation that each text block (message) belongs to exactly one class. Many modern generative models of text, in contrast, allow documents to contain many latent classes. For example, topic models such as Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA) (Blei et al., 2003) assume each document has its own distribution over multiple classes (often called topics). For many predictive tasks, topic models outperform singleclass generative models such as Naive Bayes. These properties could similarly be desirable in conversation modeling. An email might contain a request, a question, and an answer to a previous question three distinct dialog acts within a single message. This motivates the desire to allow a message to be a mixture of classes.

Conversely, the class containing URLs (which corresponds to the act of sharing news or media) is likely to begin a thread, but is not likely to follow other classes except itself. How well unsupervised models can truly capture speech acts is an open question. Much as LDA topics do not always correspond to what humans would judge to be semantic classes (Chang et al., 2009), the conversation classes inferred by unsupervised sequence models are similarly unlikely to be a perfect fit to human-assigned classes. Nevertheless, these results suggest M4 is a step forward. Our model provides a framework for defining intermessage transitions as functions of multiple classes, which will be a desirable property for many corpora. 6 Conclusion We have presented mixed membership Markov models (M4), which extend the simple HMM approach to discourse modeling by positing class assignments at the level of individual tokens.

(2011b). The idea is to introduce a binary switching variable x into the model which determines whether a word is generated from the general background distribution or from the distribution specific to a latent class z. Loosely, if the marginal probability of a word was given by p(w) = P z p(w|z)p(z), the introduction of a background distribution gives the marginal probability p(w) = p(x = 0)p(w|B) + p(x = 1) P z p(w|z). This is common practice and we will not go into detail; see (Chemudugunta et al., 2006) for a general example on sampling switching variables. We augment all three models with a background distribution in exactly the same way, so that the comparison is fair. We use a Beta(10.0, 10.0) prior over the switching distribution. 5.4 Experimental Setup All of our results are averaged across four randomly initialized chains which are run for 5000 iterations, with five samples collected during the final 500 iterations.

We would like to quantitatively measure how closely the latent states induced by our model match these annotations.7 We can measure this with variation of information (Meila, 2003), which has been used in recent years for unsupervised evaluation, e.g. in part-ofspeech clustering (Goldwater and Griffiths, 2007). Given two sets of variable assignments z and z0, the variation of information is defined as H(Z|Z0) + H(Z0|Z). In other words, given one clustering, how much uncertainty do we have about the other? Results are shown in Figure 3: a lower value corresponds to higher similarity. On the CNET corpus, M4 outperforms both baselines in all cases by a very significant margin.

Standard topic model extensions such as n-gram models (Wallach, 2006) can straightforwardly be applied here, and indeed we already applied such an extension by incorporating background distributions in 5.3. For conversational data, it could make sense to segment 102 \x0cmessages (e.g. into sentences) and constraint each segment to belong to one class or speech act; modifications along these lines have been applied to topic models as well (Gruber et al., 2007). While we have focused on conversation modeling, M4 is a general probabilistic model that could be applied to other discourse applications, for example modeling sentences or paragraphs in articles rather than messages in conversations; it could also be applied to data beyond text. Compared to a Bayesian block HMM, M4 performs much better at a variety of tasks. A drawback is that the time complexity of inference as presented here is quadratic in the number of classes rather than linear. Improving this may be the subject of future research.

Extensions to the block HMM have incorporated mixed membership properties within blocks, notably the Markov Clustering Topic Model (Hospedales et al., 2009), which allows each HMM state to be associated with its own distribution over topics in a topic model. Like the block HMM, this still assumes a relatively small number of HMM states, but with an extra layer of latent variables before the observations are emitted. This is more restrictive than the unbounded state space of M4. Decoupling HMM states from latent classes was considered by Beal et al.

The trick in M4 is to define the transition matrix via a function of a limited number of parameters, allowing tractable inference in a model with arbitrarily many states. In topic models, log-linear formulations of latent class distributions4 are utilized in correlated topic models (Blei and Lafferty, 2007) as a means of incorporating covariance structure among topic probabilities. Applying log-linear regression to potentially many features was combined with LDA by Mimno and McCallum (2008), who model the Dirichlet prior over topics as a function of document features. In M4, such features would correspond to the class histograms of previous blocks, introducing additional dependencies between documents. One topic model that imposes sequential dependencies between documents is Sequential LDA (Du et al., 2010), which models a document as a sequence of segments (such as paragraphs) governed by a Pitman-Yor process, in which the latent topic distribution of one segment serves as the base distribution for the next segment.

While conversational features may be important, Web-derived corpora are not always annotated with this information, and the nature of conversations on the Web can vary wildly across domains and venues. Addressing these concerns, there has been recent work with unsupervised models of Web conversations based on hidden Markov models (Ritter et al., 2010), where each state corresponds to a conversational class or act. Unlike more traditional uses of HMMs in which a single token is emitted per time step, HMM emissions in conversations correspond to entire blocks of text, such that an entire message is generated at each step. Because each time step is associated with a block of variables, we refer to this type of HMM as a block HMM (Fig. 1a). While block HMMs offer a concise model of inter-message structure, they have the limitation that each text block (message) belongs to exactly one class.

We generalize the block HMM approach so that there is no longer a one-to-one correspondence between states in the Markov chain and latent discourse classes.

(2010) for modeling Twitter conversations, which will be our primary baseline. After discussing related work (4), we present experimental results on a set of Twitter conversations as well as a set of threads from CNET discussion forums (5). We show that M4 increases thread reconstruction accuracy by up to 15% compared to the HMM of Ritter et al. (2010), and we reduce variation of information against speech act annotations by an average of 18% from HMM and LDA baselines.

The rightmost term is a result of the dependency of the child blocks (C) on the class assignments of b. Due to the rightmost term, the complexity of computing the sampling distribution is quadratic in the number of classes, rather than the linear complexity of a single-class HMM. Our assumption is that the number of sequence-dependent classes (e.g. speech acts or discourse states) will be reasonably small. If it is desired to have a large number of latent topics as is common in LDA, this model could be combined with a standard topic model without sequential dependencies, as explored by Ritter et al.

In the conversation domain, this corresponds to the task of thread reconstruction (Yeh and Harnly, 2006; Wang et al., 2011c). Given only a flat structure, can we recover the reply structure of messages in the conversation? Previous work with BHMM found the optimal structure by computing the likelihood of all permutations of a thread or sequence (Ritter et al., 2010; Wang et al., 2011b). We take a more practical approach and find the optimal structure as part of our inference procedure. We do this by treating the parent of each block as a hidden variable to be inferred. The parent of block b is the random variable rb, and we alternate between sampling values of the latent classes z and the parents r. The sampling distributions are annealed, as a search technique to find the best configuration of assignments (Finkel et al., 2005).

With this rising interest in social domains, it is natural to consider models which explicitly incorporate the conversational patterns of social text. Compared to the naive approach of treating conversations as flat documents, models which include conversation structure have been shown to improve tasks such as forum search (Elsas and Carbonell, 2009; Seo et al., 2009), question answering and expert finding (Xu et al., 2008; Wang et al., 2011a), and interpersonal relationship identification (Diehl et al., 2007). While conversational features may be important, Web-derived corpora are not always annotated with this information, and the nature of conversations on the Web can vary wildly across domains and venues. Addressing these concerns, there has been recent work with unsupervised models of Web conversations based on hidden Markov models (Ritter et al., 2010), where each state corresponds to a conversational class or act.

In the case of conversation data, our hope is that some of the latent classes represent speech acts or dialog acts (Searle, 1975). While there is a body of work in supervised speech act classification (Cohen et al., 2004; Bangalore et al., 2006; Surendran and Levow, 2006; Qadir and Riloff, 2011), the variety of conversation domains on the Web motivates the use of unsupervised ap5 10 15 20 25 Number of classes 2.0 2.5 3.0 3.5 4.0 4.5 5.0 Variation of Information (VI) Speech Act Clustering (CNET) Random LDA BHMM M4 Figure 3: The variation of information between the human-created speech act annotations of the CNET corpus and the latent class assignments by various models. proaches.

This type of model can be viewed as an HMM with an expanded state space, but because the transition probabilities are a function of a small number of parameters, the output remains human-interpretible. M4 can be taken as a general family of models and can be readily extended. In this work, we focused on introducing a model of inter-message structure, but certainly more sophisticated models of intramessage structure beyond unigram language models could be incorporated into M4. Standard topic model extensions such as n-gram models (Wallach, 2006) can straightforwardly be applied here, and indeed we already applied such an extension by incorporating background distributions in 5.3. For conversational data, it could make sense to segment 102 \x0cmessages (e.g. into sentences) and constraint each segment to belong to one class or speech act; modifications along these lines have been applied to topic models as well (Gruber et al., 2007). While we have focused on conversation modeling, M4 is a general probabilistic model that could be applied to other discourse applications, for example modeling sentences or paragraphs in articles rather t</context>

We instead handle this by extending our model to include a background distribution over words which is independent of the latent classes in a document; this was also done by Wang et al. (2011b). The idea is to introduce a binary switching variable x into the model which determines whether a word is generated from the general background distribution or from the distribution specific to a latent class z. Loosely, if the marginal probability of a word was given by p(w) = P z p(w|z)p(z), the introduction of a background distribution gives the marginal probability p(w) = p(x = 0)p(w|B) + p(x = 1) P z p(w|z).
