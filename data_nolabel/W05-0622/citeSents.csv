We apply conditional random fields (CRFs) to the task of SRL proposed by the CoNLL shared task 2005 CITATION,,
CRFs are undirected graphical models which define a conditional distribution over labellings given an observation CITATION,,
CRFs have been applied with impressive empirical results to the tasks of named entity recognition (CITATION; CITATION), part-of-speech (PoS) tagging CITATION, noun phrase chunking CITATION and extraction of table data CITATION, among other tasks,,
Additionally, the dashed lines show those edges which were pruned, following CITATION only nodes which,,
While CRFs have not been used to date for SRL, their close cousin, the maximum entropy model has been, with strong generalisation performance (CITATION; CITATION,,

This required the repeated calculation of the log-likelihood and its derivative, which in turn required the use of dynamic programming to calculate the marginal probability of each possible labelling of every clique using the sum-product algorithm CITATION,,
These features are common to many SRL systems and are described in CITATION,,
While CRFs have not been used to date for SRL, their close cousin, the maximum entropy model has been, with strong generalisation performance (CITATION; CITATION),,
Additionally, the dashed lines show those edges which were pruned, following CITATION only nodes which are siblings to a node on the path from the verb to the root are included in the tree,,
