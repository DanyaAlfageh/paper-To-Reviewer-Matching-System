1 Introduction Thanks to automatic information extraction and semantic Web efforts, keyword search over unstructured Web text is rapidly evolving toward entityand type-oriented queries (CITATION; CITATION) over semi-structured databases such as Wikipedia, Freebase, and other forms of Linked Data,,
Starting with about 752,450 pages, we ran the Stanford NER CITATION to mark person spans,,
Unlike in 5.1, where the true and proposed types could be compared via M&W CITATION, they could not be asked to objectively estimate relatedness between types,,
A third baseline, Z0, from CITATION does only snippet annotation; they do not consider typing entities,,
We compute the IDF of all words in this corpus3, and then represent each type as a TFIDF vector CITATION,,
For these reasons, the few known systems for Freebase-based annotation CITATION are evaluated exclusively on F W,,
Googles FACC1 CITATION annotations restricted to people; TMI is significantly better,,
Consequently, accurate corpus annotation has been intensely investigated (CITATION; CITATION; Milne,,
CITATION and (Zheng et al., ,,
With two exceptions (CITATION; CITATION) that we discuss later, public-domain corpus annotation work has almost exclusively used Wikipedia and derivatives, partly because Wikipedia provides not only a standardized space of entities, but also reliably labeled mention text within its own documents, which can be use,,
We remedy the problem using an idea from PathRank CITATION,,
In concurrent work, CITATION propose integer linear program formulations for inferring types of emerging entities from the way their mentions are embedded in curated relation-revealing phrases,,
First, we evaluate TMI on over 1100 entities in F W and 5500 snippets from Wikipedia text, where it visibly improves upon baselines and a recently proposed alternative method CITATION,,
This model component is in the same spirit as CITATION,,
We use the standard M&W score of semantic similarity between types CITATION for this,,
With two exceptions (CITATION; CITATION) that we discuss later, public-domain corpus annotation work has almost exclusively used Wikipedia and derivatives, partly because Wikipedia provides not only a standardized space of entities, but also reliably labeled mention text within its own documents, which can be used to train machine learning alg,,
In 5.3, we compare TMI with Googles recently published FACC1 annotations CITATION,,
CITATION have recently released FACC1: annotations of ClueWeb09 and ClueWeb12 with Freebase entities,,
CITATION use entity names for distant supervision in POS tagging, chunking and broad named entity typing in short tweets, which are different from our goals,,
Third, we compare TMI annotations with Googles FACC1 CITATION annotations restricted to people; TMI is significantly better,,
CITATION and CITATION are notable exceptions,,
CITATION earlier approached the problem using weight propagation in a bipartite graph connecting unknown to known entities via textual relation patterns,,
This simple approach was found superior to building a more traditional smoothed multinomial unigram model CITATION for each type,,
umen@cse.iitb.ac.in YAGO CITATION provides such a catalog by unifying Wikipedia and WordNet, followed by some cleanup,,
As regards snippet annotation, Z0 CITATION does not specify any mechanism for handling ,,
Like CITATION, they depend on unambiguous entity-mention pai,,
Equipped with suitable indices, a catalog and an annotated corpus let us find scientists who played some musical instrument, and answer many other powerful classes of queries (CITATION; CITATION),,
The closest work to ours is by CITATION: they use semisupervised learning to annotate a corpus with Freebase entities,,
For each phrase p P(m), if p occurs at least once4 in any node of N(e), then we accumulate a credit of |p| P wp IDF(w), where w ranges over words in p, IDF(w) is its inverse document frequency CITATION in Wikipedia, and |p |is the length of the phrase,,
With two exceptions (CITATION; CITATION) that we discuss later, public-domain corpus annotation work has almost exclusively used Wikipedia and derivatives, partly because Wikipedia provides not only a standardized space of entities, but also reliably labeled mention text within its own documents, which can be used to train machine learning algorithms for entity disambiguation,,
5.1.4 Type prediction results We also compared the type inference accuracy of TMI and T0; CITATION do not infer types,,
5.3 Comparison with FACC1 After collecting our pool of snippets as in 5.2.2, we consulted FACC1 CITATION, and passed on FACC1 annotations to our editors,,
For reasons to be made clear, we choose YAGO CITATION as the type catalog T accompanying entities in W,,
Z0s performance here is worse than in CITATION,,
2 Related work The vast majority of entity annotation work (CITATION; CITATION; CITATION; CITATION; Han et al., 2011; CITATION; CITATION) use Wikipedia or derivative knowledge bases,,
Consequently, accurate corpus annotation has been intensely investigated (CITATION; CITATION; CITATION; CITATION; Han et al., 2011; CITATION; CITATION),,
soumen@cse.iitb.ac.in YAGO CITATION provides such a catalog by unifying Wikipedia and WordNet, followed by some cleanup,,
Like CITATION, they depend on unambiguous entity-mention pairs to bootstrap a classifier, then apply it to unlabeled, ambiguous mentions, creating more training data,,
I.e., CITATION did not complete their entity sets with aliased entities,,
Contrast this with CITATION, who sample entities from much ,,
ntities in F W and 5500 snippets from Wikipedia text, where it visibly improves upon baselines and a recently proposed alternative method CITATION,,
We seek the maximum a-posteriori (MAP) label, for which we use tree-reweighted message passing (TRW-S) CITATION,,
