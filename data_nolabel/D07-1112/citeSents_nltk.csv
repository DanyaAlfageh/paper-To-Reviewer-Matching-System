Recent theoretical work on domain adaptation CITATION attributes adaptation loss to two sources: the difference in the distribution between domains and the difference in labeling functions.,,
Next, we tried instance bagging CITATION to generate some diversity among parsers.,,
To address conflicting annota1053 \x0ctions, we added slack variables to the MIRA learning algorithm CITATION used to train the parsers, without success.,,
We were given around 15K sentences of labeled text from the Wall Street Journal (WSJ) (CITATION; CITATION) as well as 200K unlabeled sentences.,,
The development data was 200 sentences of labeled biomedical oncology text (BIO, the ONCO portion of the Penn Biomedical Treebank), as well as 200K unlabeled sentences CITATION.,,
The two test domains were a collection of medline chemistry abstracts (pchem, the CYP portion of the Penn Biomedical Treebank) and the Child Language Data Exchange System corpus (CHILDES) (CITATION; CITATION).,,
We used the second order two stage parser and edge labeler of CITATION, which achieved top results in the 2006 CoNLL-X shared task.,,

The annotation guidelines for the Penn Treebank flattened noun phrases to simplify annotation CITATION, so there is no complex structure to NPs.,,
CITATION showed that it is difficult to compare the Penn Treebank to other treebanks with more complex noun structures, such as BIO.,,
