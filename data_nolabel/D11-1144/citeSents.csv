MaxEnt classifiers (CITATION; Ratnaparkhi 1998) have been applied to various NLP applications,,
When encountering words that are out-of-vocabulary (OOV) in the test set, if those words are assigned the same cluster membership as some other words in the training set, the cluster feature will fire, allowing for correct classification results to be obtained (CITATION; CITATION),,

POS tagging, sentence boundary detection, and word sense disambiguation (Riloff 1999; CITATION; CITATION; CITATION; CITATION),,
When encountering words that are out-of-vocabulary (OOV) in the test set, if those words are assigned the same cluster membership as some other words in the training set, the cluster feature will fire, allowing for correct classification results to be obtained (CITATION; Faruqui and Pado ,,
A more NLP-oriented approach is proposed in CITATION, where noun phrases are extracted from online user reviews,,
In (CITATION; CITATION), several bootstrapping methods are compared,,
Similar work is presented in CITATION,,
Similar to the acronym expansion algorithm of CITATION which learns contexts that associate acronyms to their correct expansions, the intuition behind our work in this section is that the classifier, trained on a labeled training set of known brands, learns context patterns that can discriminate the current word as being a brand (more precisely as part of a brand) from the other attribute types, which are now lumped together as NA,,
More recently, Conditional Random Fields (CRF) (CITATION; McCallum 2003) has been proposed for a sequence labeling problem and has been established by many as the state-ofthe-art model for supervised named entity recognition task,,
By using real-world constraints such as known song titles, CITATION restricts the set of possible entities and are able to obtain reasonable recognition performance,,
To this end, we investigate several string similarity/distance measures for this task and found that n-gram substring similarity CITATION yields accurate normalization results,,
Popular clustering algorithms used prevalently in many NER systems are, for example, the combination of distributional and morphological similarity work of CITATION or the classic N-gram language model based clustering algorithm of CITATION,,
In CITATION, a Naive Bayes learner is combined with Co-EM to generate more training data from unlabeled data, and attribute-value pairs are extracted on adjacent words,,
The automatic bootstrapping in this paper was inspired by CITATIONan acronym expansion algorithm for medical text documents,,
1 Introduction Traditional named entity recognition (NER) task has expanded beyond identifying people, location, and organization to book titles, email addresses, phone numbers, and protein names CITATION,,

4.1.5 Conditional Random Field (CRF) Conditional Random Field, since its conception in the seminal work of CITATION, is a discriminative classifier for sequential data that combines the best of both worlds,,
CITATION proposes an NER system that extracts personal names from emails,,
Our seed list expansion algorithm indeed bears some similarity to the work of (Nadeau el al 2006) and CITATION,,
pping method is presented in CITATION, where instances of known entity relations (or seed list in our paper) are matched to sentences in a set of Wikipedia articles, and a learning algorithm is trained from the surrounding features of the entities,,
Finally, another similar bootstrapping method is presented in CITATION, where instan,,
substrings of length n CITATION,,
Such text data tend to be long and generate enough context for the target task (CITATION; CITATION; CITATION),,
Indeed CRF has been established by many as the state-of-theart supervised named entity recognition system for traditional NER tasks (CITATION; McCallum 2003), for NER in biomedical texts CITATION, and in various languages besides English, such as Bengali CITATION and Chinese CITATION,,
In CITATION, char N-gram features consistently outperform word features in learning effective spam classifiers,,
The use of char N-gram (N-gram substring) features was inspired by the work of CITATION, where the introduction of such features has been shown to improve the overall F1 score by over 20%,,

1561 \x0cWe adopt the approach from the work of CITATION, which uses Viterbi to improve the classification results from MaxEnt classifier for NER tasks,,
Various modifications to CRF have recently been introduced to take into account of non-local dependencies CITATION or broader context beyond training data CITATION,,
Following the convention in CITATION, we use the following set of 5 tags, (1) one-token entity (B1 tag) (2) first token of a multi-token entity (Bo tag for Brandopen) (3) last token of a multi-token entity (Bc tag for Brand-close) (4) middle token of a multi-token entity (Bi tag for Brand-inside) (5) token that is not part of a brand entity (NA tag),,
The HMM implementation used in our experiments is the Hunpos tagger in CITATION, which captures the state transitional probabilities using second-order Markov model,,
SVM CITATION and Maximum Entropy model for NER CITATION, have been shown to outperform generative model based classifiers,,
In addition, because of data sparsity (out-of-vocabulary) problem due to the long-tailed distribution of words in natural language, sophisticated unknown word models are generally needed for good performance CITATION,,
For SVM, we use the popular libSVM package CITATION which produces probabilistic output from fitting a sigmoid function to the distances between samples and the separating hyperplane,,
