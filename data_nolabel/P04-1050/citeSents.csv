(2004) into a 1 For example, one could equate utterance with sentence (CITATION; CITATION), use indirect realisation for the computation of the CF list CITATION, rank the CFs according to their information status CITATION, etc,,
Like CITATION, we noticed that utterances like (a) in example (1), should always appear at the beginning of a felicitous museum label,,
According to Centering Theory (CITATION; CITATIONa), an important factor for the felicity of (1) is its entity coherence: the way centers (discourse entities), such as the referent of the NPs 144 in clause (a) and its in clause (b), are introduced and discussed in subsequent clauses,,
The first distinguishing feature is that we assume a search-based approach to text structuring (CITATION; CITATION; CITATION) in which many candidate orderings of clauses are evaluated according to scores assigned by a given metric, and the best-scoring ordering among the candidate solutions is chosen,,
We call this metric M.NOCB, following CITATION,,
These results, reported in CITATION, indicate that these constraints conflict with Centering as formulated in this paper, by increasing - instead of reducing - the classification rate of the metrics,,
The output of text structuring is merely an ordering of these clauses, rather than the tree-like structure of database facts often used in traditional deep generation CITATION,,
by a domain expert CITATION,,
Finally, the scripts determine whether CBn is the same as CPn1, known as the principle of cheapness CITATION,,
We also tried to account for some additional constraints on coherence, namely local rhetorical relations, based on some of the assumptions in CITATION, and what CITATION calls the PageFocus which corresponds to the main entity described in a text, in our example de374,,
We also tried to account for some additional constraints on coherence, namely local rhetorical relations, based on some of the assumptions in CITATION, and what CITATION calls the PageF,,
1 Motivation Our research area is descriptive text generation (CITATION; CITATION), i.e,,
 evaluations of Centering such as CITATION, Di Eugenio (1998), CITATION among others,,
(2004) and indeed by all previous corpus-based evaluations of Centering such as CITATION, Di Eugenio (1998), CITATION among others,,
the theory are useful to guide text structuring, in combination with other factors (see CITATION for an overview),,
However, CITATION pointed out that many metrics of coherence can be derived from the claims of Centering, all of which could be used for the type of text structuring assumed in this paper,,
According to Centering Theory (CITATION; CITATIONa), an important factor for the felicity of (1) is its entity coherence: t,,
2.1 Computing CF lists, CPs and CBs According to CITATION, each utterance in a discourse is assigned a list of forward looking centers (CF list) each of which is realised by at least one NP in the utterance,,
According to Centering Theory (CITATION; CITATIONa), an important factor for the felicity of (1) is its entity coherence: the way centers (disco,,
When CFn and CFn1 do not have any centers in common, we compute the nocb transition CITATION (Poesio et als null transition) for Un (e.g., utterance (d) in Table 1).5 4 In accordance with Centering, no CB is computed for (a), the first utterance in the sequence,,
The first distinguishing feature is that we assume a search-based approach to text structuring (CITATION; CITATION; CITATION) in which many candidate orderings of clauses are evaluated according to scores assigned by a g,,
These studies, however, do not investigate the question that is most important from the text structuring perspective adopted in this paper: whether there would be alternative ways of structuring the text that would result in fewer violations of Centerings constraints CITATION,,
In order to restrict the scope of the experiment to the text-type most relevant to our study, we selected 20 museum labels, i.e., short texts that describe a concrete artefact, which served as the input to seec together with the metrics in section 3.10 5.1 Permutation and search strategy In specifying the performance of the metrics we made use of a simple permutation heuristic exploiting a piece of domain-specific communication knowledge CITATION,,
However, how successful Centerings constraints are on their own in generating a felicitous text structure is an open question, already raised by the seminal papers of the theory (Brennan et al., 1987; CITATION),,
The second novel aspect is that our approach is based on the position that the most straightforward way of using Centering for text structuring is by defining a Centering-based metric of coherence CITATION,,
 seminal papers of the theory (Brennan et al., 1987; CITATION),,
The first distinguishing feature is that we assume a search-based approach to text structuring (CITATION; CITATION; CITATION) in which many candidate orderings of clauses are evaluated according to scores assigned by a given metric, an,,
In accordance with recent work in the emerging field of text-to-text generation (CITATION; CITATION), we assume that the input to text structuring is a set of clauses,,
It is often claimed in current work on in natural language generation that the constraints on felicitous text proposed by the theory are useful to guide text structuring, in combination with other factors (see CITATION for an overview),,
7 Further results In related work, we applied the methodology discussed here to a larger set of existing data (122 BfCs) derived from the MPIRO system and ordered by a domain expert CITATION,,
M.KP sums up the nocbs and the violations of cheapness, coherence and salience, preferring the ordering with the lowest total cost CITATION,,
