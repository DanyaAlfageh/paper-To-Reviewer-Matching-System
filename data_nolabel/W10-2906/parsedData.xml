This work shows how to improve state-of-the-art
monolingual natural language processing models
using unannotated bilingual text. We build a mul-
tiview learning objective that enforces agreement
between monolingual and bilingual models. In
our method the first, monolingual view consists of
supervised predictors learned separately for each
language. The second, bilingual view consists of
log-linear predictors learned over both languages
on bilingual text. Our training procedure estimates
the parameters of the bilingual model using the
output of the monolingual model, and we show how
to combine the two models to account for depen-
dence between views. For the task of named entity
recognition, using bilingual predictors increases F1
by 16.1% absolute over a supervised monolingual
model, and retraining on bilingual predictions
increases monolingual model F1 by 14.6%. For
syntactic parsing, our bilingual predictor increases
F1 by 2.1% absolute, and retraining a monolingual
model on its output gives an improvement of 2.0%.

1 Introduction
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.99943498275862">
Natural language analysis in one language can be
improved by exploiting translations in another lan-
guage. This observation has formed the basis for
important work on syntax projection across lan-
guages (Yarowsky et al., 2001; Hwa et al., 2005;
Ganchev et al., 2009) and unsupervised syntax
induction in multiple languages (Snyder et al.,
2009), as well as other tasks, such as cross-lingual
named entity recognition (Huang and Vogel, 2002;
Moore, 2003) and information retrieval (Si and
Callan, 2005). In all of these cases, multilingual
models yield increased accuracy because differ-
ent languages present different ambiguities and
therefore offer complementary constraints on the
shared underlying labels.
In the present work, we consider a setting where
we already possess supervised monolingual mod-
els, and wish to improve these models using unan-
notated bilingual parallel text (bitext). We cast this
problem in the multiple-view (multiview) learning
framework (Blum and Mitchell, 1998; Collins and
Singer, 1999; Balcan and Blum, 2005; Ganchev et
al., 2008). Our two views are a monolingual view,
which uses the supervised monolingual models but
not bilingual information, and a bilingual view,
which exploits features that measure agreement
across languages. The parameters of the bilin-
gual view are trained to reproduce the output of
the monolingual view. We show that by introduc-
ing weakened monolingual models into the bilin-
gual view, we can optimize the parameters of the
bilingual model to improve monolingual models.
At prediction time, we automatically account for
the between-view dependence introduced by the
weakened monolingual models with a simple but
effective view-combination heuristic.
We demonstrate the performance of this method
on two problems. The first is named en-
tity recognition (NER). For this problem, our
method automatically learns (a variation on) ear-
lier hand-designed rule-based bilingual NER pre-
dictors (Huang and Vogel, 2002; Moore, 2003),
resulting in absolute performance gains of up to
16.1% F1. The second task we consider is statis-
tical parsing. For this task, we follow the setup
of Burkett and Klein (2008), who improved Chi-
nese and English monolingual parsers using par-
allel, hand-parsed text. We achieve nearly iden-
tical improvements using a purely unlabeled bi-
text. These results carry over to machine transla-
tion, where we can achieve slightly better BLEU
improvements than the supervised model of Bur-
kett and Klein (2008) since we are able to train
our model directly on the parallel data where we
perform rule extraction.
Finally, for both of our tasks, we use our bilin-
gual model to generate additional automatically
labeled monolingual training data. We compare

show an improvement of up to 14.4% F1 for entity
recognition. Even for parsing, where the bilingual
portion of the treebank is much smaller than the
monolingual, our technique still can improve over
purely monolingual self-training by 0.7% F1.

<bodyText confidence="0.998985095238095">
Prior work in learning monolingual models from
bitexts falls roughly into three categories: Unsu-
pervised induction, cross-lingual projection, and
bilingual constraints for supervised monolingual
models. Two recent, successful unsupervised
induction methods are those of Blunsom et al.
(2009) and Snyder et al. (2009). Both of them es-
timate hierarchical Bayesian models and employ
bilingual data to constrain the types of models that
can be derived. Projection methods, on the other
hand, were among the first applications of parallel
text (after machine translation) (Yarowsky et al.,
2001; Yarowsky and Ngai, 2001; Hwa et al., 2005;
Ganchev et al., 2009). They assume the existence
of a good, monolingual model for one language
but little or no information about the second lan-
guage. Given a parallel sentence pair, they use the
annotations for one language to heavily constrain
the set of possible annotations for the other.
Our work falls into the final category: We wish
to use bilingual data to improve monolingual mod-
els which are already trained on large amounts of
data and effective on their own (Huang and Vo-
gel, 2002; Smith and Smith, 2004; Snyder and
Barzilay, 2008; Burkett and Klein, 2008). Proce-
durally, our work is most closely related to that
of Burkett and Klein (2008). They used an an-
notated bitext to learn parse reranking models for
English and Chinese, exploiting features that ex-
amine pieces of parse trees in both languages. Our
method can be thought of as the semi-supervised
counterpart to their supervised model. Indeed, we
achieve nearly the same results, but without anno-
tated bitexts. Smith and Smith (2004) consider
a similar setting for parsing both English and Ko-
rean, but instead of learning a joint model, they
consider a fixed combination of two parsers and
a word aligner. Our model learns parameters for
combining two monolingual models and poten-
tially thousands of bilingual features. The result
is that our model significantly improves state-of-
the-art results, for both parsing and NER.

3 A Multiview Bilingual Model
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.9827198125">
Given two input sentences x = (x1, x2) that
are word-aligned translations of each other, we
consider the problem of predicting (structured)
labels y = (y1, y2) by estimating conditional
models on pairs of labels from both languages,
p(y1, y2|x1, x2). Our model consists of two views,
which we will refer to as monolingual and bilin-
gual. The monolingual view estimates the joint
probability as the product of independent marginal
distributions over each language, pM (y|x) =
p1(y1|x1)p2(y2|x2). In our applications, these
marginal distributions will be computed by state-
of-the-art statistical taggers and parsers trained on
large monolingual corpora.
This work focuses on learning parameters for
the bilingual view of the data. We parameterize
the bilingual view using at most one-to-one match-
ings between nodes of structured labels in each
language (Burkett and Klein, 2008). In this work,
we use the term node to indicate a particular com-
ponent of a label, such as a single (multi-word)
named entity or a node in a parse tree. In Fig-
ure 2(a), for example, the nodes labeled NP1 in
both the Chinese and English trees are matched.
Since we dont know a priori how the components
relate to one another, we treat these matchings as
hidden. For each matching a and pair of labels
y, we define a feature vector (y1, a, y2) which
factors on edges in the matching. Our model is
a conditional exponential family distribution over
matchings and labels:
p(y, a|x) = exp

where is a parameter vector, and A(; x) is the
log partition function for a sentence pair x. We
must approximate A(; x) because summing over
all at most one-to-one matchings a is #P-hard. We
approximate this sum using the maximum-scoring
matching (Burkett and Klein, 2008):

We further simplify inference in our model by
working in a reranking setting (Collins, 2000;
Charniak and Johnson, 2005), where we only con-

in both languages, for a total of k2 labels y. In
practice, k2 10, 000 for our largest problem.

3.1 Including Weakened Models
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999819515151515">
Now that we have defined our bilingual model, we
could train it to agree with the output of the mono-
lingual model (Collins and Singer, 1999; Ganchev
et al., 2008). As we will see in Section 4, however,
the feature functions (y1, a, y2) make no refer-
ence to the input sentences x, other than through a
fixed word alignment. With such limited monolin-
gual information, it is impossible for the bilingual
model to adequately capture all of the information
necessary for NER or parsing. As a simple ex-
ample, a bilingual NER model will be perfectly
happy to label two aligned person names as ORG
instead of PER: both labelings agree equally well.
We briefly illustrate how poorly such a basic bilin-
gual model performs in Section 10.
One way to solve this problem is to include the
output of the full monolingual models as features
in the bilingual view. However, we are training the
bilingual view to match the output of these same
models, which can be trivially achieved by putting
weight on only the monolingual model scores and
never recruiting any bilingual features. There-
fore, we use an intermediate approach: we intro-
duce the output of deliberately weakened mono-
lingual models as features in the bilingual view.
A weakened model is from the same class as the
full monolingual models, but is intentionally crip-
pled in some way (by removing feature templates,
for example). Crucially, the weakened models will
make predictions that are roughly similar to the
full models, but systematically worse. Therefore,
model scores from the weakened models provide
enough power for the bilingual view to make accu-

Before formally describing our algorithm for find-
ing the parameters [1, 2, ], we first give exam-
ples of our problems of named entity recognition
and syntactic parsing, together with node align-
ments and features for each. Figure 1 depicts a
correctly-labeled sentence fragment in both En-
glish and German. In English, the capitalization of
the phrase European Court of Auditors helps iden-
tify the span as a named entity. However, in Ger-
man, all nouns are capitalized, and capitalization
is therefore a less useful cue. While a monolin-
gual German tagger is likely to miss the entity in
the German text, by exploiting the parallel English
text and word alignment information, we can hope
to improve the German performance, and correctly
tag Europaischen Rechnungshofes.
The monolingual features are standard features
for discriminative, state-of-the-art entity recogniz-
ers, and we can produce weakened monolingual
models by simply limiting the feature set. The
bilingual features, (y1, a, y2), are over pairs of
aligned nodes, where nodes of the labels y1 and
y2 are simply the individual named entities. We
use a small bilingual feature set consisting of two
types of features. First, we use the word alignment
density features from Burkett and Klein (2008),
which measure how well the aligned entity pair
matches up with alignments from an independent

tures: a bias feature that allows the model to learn
a general preference for matched entities, and a
feature that is active whenever the pair of nodes
has the same label. Figure 1 contains sample val-
ues for each of these features.
Another natural setting where bilingual con-
straints can be exploited is syntactic parsing. Fig-
ure 2 shows an example English prepositional
phrase attachment ambiguity that can be resolved
bilingually by exploiting Chinese. The English
monolingual parse mistakenly attaches to to the
verb increased. In Chinese, however, this ambi-
guity does not exist. Instead, the word , which
aligns to to, has strong selectional preference for
attaching to a noun on the left.
In our parsing experiments, we use the Berke-
ley parser (Petrov et al., 2006; Petrov and Klein,
2007), a split-merge latent variable parser, for our
monolingual models. Our full model is the re-
sult of training the parser with five split-merge
phases. Our weakened model uses only two. For
the bilingual model, we use the same bilingual fea-
ture set as Burkett and Klein (2008). Table 2 gives
some examples, but does not exhaustively enumer-
ate those features.

Previous work in multiview learning has focused
on the case of agreement regularization (Collins
and Singer, 1999; Ganchev et al., 2008). If we had
bilingual labeled data, together with our unlabeled
data and monolingual labeled data, we could ex-
ploit these techniques. Because we do not possess
bilingual labeled data, we must train the bilingual
model in another way. Here we advocate train-
ing the bilingual model (consisting of the bilin-
gual features and weakened monolingual models)
to imitate the full monolingual models. In terms
of agreement regularization, our procedure may be
thought of as regularizing the bilingual model to
be similar to the full monolingual models.

Our training algorithm is summarized in Fig-
ure 3. For each unlabeled point x = (x1, x2), let
yM be the joint label which has the highest score
from the independent monolingual models (line
1). We then find bilingual parameters , 1, 2
that maximize q,1,2
(yx|x) (line 2). This max-
likelihood optimization can be solved by an EM-
like procedure (Burkett and Klein, 2008). This
procedure iteratively updates the parameter esti-
mates by (a) finding the optimum alignments for
each candidate label pair under the current pa-
rameters and then (b) updating the parameters to
maximize a modified version of Equation 1, re-
stricted to the optimal alignments. Because we re-
strict alignments to the set of at most one-to-one
matchings, the (a) step is tractable using the Hun-
garian algorithm. With the alignments fixed, the
(b) step just involves maximizing likelihood under
a log-linear model with no latent variables this
problem is convex and can be solved efficiently
using gradient-based methods. The procedure has
no guarantees, but is observed in practice to con-
verge to a local optimum.

particular, the monolingual view uses monolingual
models that are known to be superior to the mono-
lingual information available in the bilingual view.
Thus, we would like to find some way to incorpo-
rate the full monolingual models into our predic-
tion method. One obvious choice is to choose the
labeling that maximizes the agreement distribu-
tion (Collins and Singer, 1999; Ganchev et al.,
2008). In our setting, this amounts to choosing:

This is the correct decision rule if the views are
independent and the labels y are uniformly dis-
tributed a priori,1 but we have deliberately in-
troduced between-view dependence in the form
of the weakened monolingual models. Equa-
tion 3 implicitly double-counts monolingual infor-
mation.
One way to avoid this double-counting is to
simply discard the weakened monolingual models
when making a joint prediction:

See, e.g. Ando &amp; Zhang(Ando and Zhang, 2007) for a
derivation of the decision rule from Equation 3 under these
assumptions.
This decision rule uniformly combines the two
monolingual models and the bilingual model.
Note, however, that we have already learned non-
uniform weights for the weakened monolingual
models. Our final decision rule uses these weights
as weights for the full monolingual models:

advantage of parallel corpora by using our bilin-
gual models to generate new training data for the
monolingual models. This can be especially use-
ful when we wish to use our monolingual models
in a domain for which we lack annotated data, but
for which bitexts are plentiful.2
Our retraining procedure is summarized in Fig-
ure 5. Once we have trained our bilingual param-
eters and have a Bilingual w/ Full predictor (us-
ing Equation 5), we can use that predictor to an-
notate a large corpus of parallel data (line 1b). We
then retrain the full monolingual models on a con-
catenation of their original training data and the
newly annotated data (line 3). We refer to the new
monolingual models retrained on the output of the
bilingual models as Bilingual-Retrained, and we
tested such models for both NER and parsing. For
comparison, we also retrained monolingual mod-
els directly on the output of the original full mono-
lingual models, using the same unannotated bilin-
gual corpora for self-training (line 1a). We refer to
these models as Self-Retrained.
We evaluated our retrained monolingual mod-
els on the same test sets as our bilingual mod-
els, but using only monolingual data at test time.
The texts used for retraining overlapped with the
bitexts used for training the bilingual model, but
both sets were disjoint from the test sets.

training data. The bilingual model parameters
were trained on 5,000 parallel sentences extracted
from the Europarl corpus. For the retraining
experiments, we added an additional 5,000 sen-
tences, for 10,000 in all. For testing, we used
the Europarl 2006 development set and the 2007
newswire test set. Neither of these data sets were
annotated with named entities, so we manually an-
notated 200 sentences from each of them.
We used the Stanford NER tagger (Finkel et
al., 2005) with its default configuration as our full
monolingual model for each language. We weak-
ened both the English and German models by re-
moving several non-lexical and word-shape fea-
tures. We made one more crucial change to our
monolingual German model. The German entity
recognizer has extremely low recall (44 %) when
out of domain, so we chose yx from Figure 3 to
be the label in the top five which had the largest
number of named entities.
Table 3 gives results for named entity recogni-
tion. The first two rows are the full and weak-
ened monolingual models alone. The second two
are the multiview trained bilingual models. We
first note that for English, using the full bilin-
gual model yields only slight improvements over
the baseline full monolingual model, and in prac-
tice the predictions were almost identical. For this
problem, the monolingual German model is much
worse than the monolingual English model, and so
the bilingual model doesnt offer significant im-
provements in English. The bilingual model does
show significant German improvements, however,
including a 16.1% absolute gain in F1 over the
baseline for parliamentary proceedings.
The last two rows of Table 3 give results for
monolingual models which are trained on data that
was automatically labeled using the our models.
English results were again mixed, due to the rel-
atively weak English performance of the bilin-
gual model. For German, though, the Bilingual-
Retrained model improves 14.4% F1 over the
Self-Retrained baseline.

The bilingual data consists of the parallel part of
the Chinese treebank (articles 1-270), which also
includes manually parsed English translations of
each Chinese sentence (Bies et al., 2007). Only
the Chinese sentences and their English transla-
tions were used to train the bilingual models the
gold trees were ignored. For retraining, we used
the same data, but weighted it to match the sizes
of the original monolingual treebanks. We tested
on the standard Chinese treebank development set,
which also includes English translations.

comparison, we also show results for the super-

is out of domain relative to the Penn Treebank,
are larger than those in Chinese, which is in do-

data, this bitext was fairly small relative to the an-

still learn good bilingual model parameters which

bilingual prediction, we dont expect retraining to
result in a coverage-based boost in monolingual

Chinese bitext from Wang et al. (2007) to train
Moses (Koehn et al., 2007), a phrase-based MT

For our syntactic baseline, we used the mono-
lingual English parser. For our remaining experi-
ments, we parsed both English and Chinese simul-
taneously. The supervised model and the first mul-
tiview trained model are the same Chinese tree-
bank trained models for which we reported pars-
ing results. We also used our multiview method to
train an additional bilingual model on part of the
bitext we used to extract translation rules.
The results are shown in Table 5. Once again,
our multiview trained model yields comparable re-
sults to the supervised model. Furthermore, while
the differences are small, our best performance
comes from the model trained on in-domain data,
for which no gold trees exist.

10 Analyzing Combined Prediction

In this section, we explore combinations of the full
monolingual models, p1(y1|x1) and p2(y2|x2),
and the bilingual model, max
a
&amp;gt;
(y1, a, y2). For
parsing, the results in this section are for combined
F1. This simply computes F1 over all of the sen-
tences in both the English and Chinese test sets.
For NER, we just use German F1, since English is
relatively constant across runs.
We begin by examining how poorly our model
performs if we do not consider monolingual in-
formation in the bilingual view. For parsing, the
combined Chinese and English F1 for this model
is 78.7%. When we combine this model uniformly
with the full monolingual model, as in Equation 4,
combined F1 improves to 81.2%, but is still well
below our best combined score of 82.1%. NER
results for a model trained without monolingual
information show an even larger decline.
Now let us consider decision rules of the form:

Note that when 1 = 2 = 1, this is exactly
the uniform decision rule (Equation 4). When
1 = 1 and 2 = 2, this is the Bilingual w/
Full decision rule (Equation 5). Figure 6 is a
contour plot of F1 with respect to the parameters
1 and 2. Our decision rule Bilingual w/ Full
(Equation 5, marked with a +) is near the opti-
mum (*), while the uniform decision rule (-)
performs quite poorly. This is true for both NER
(Figure 6a) and parsing (Figure 6b).
There is one more decision rule which we have
yet to consider: the conditional independence
decision rule from Equation 3. While this rule can-
not be shown on the plots in Figure 6 (because
it uses both the full and weakened monolingual
models), we note that it also performs poorly in
both cases (80.7% F1 for parsing, for example).

We show for the first time that state-of-the-art,
discriminative monolingual models can be signifi-
cantly improved using unannotated bilingual text.
We do this by first building bilingual models that
are trained to agree with pairs of independently-
trained monolingual models. Then we combine
the bilingual and monolingual models to account
for dependence across views. By automatically
annotating unlabeled bitexts with these bilingual
models, we can train new monolingual models that
do not rely on bilingual data at test time, but still
perform substantially better than models trained
using only monolingual resources.

<abstract confidence="0.997170863636364">This work shows how to improve state-of-the-art monolingual natural language processing models using unannotated bilingual text. We build a multiview learning objective that enforces agreement between monolingual and bilingual models. In our method the first, monolingual view consists of supervised predictors learned separately for each language. The second, bilingual view consists of log-linear predictors learned over both languages on bilingual text. Our training procedure estimates the parameters of the bilingual model using the output of the monolingual model, and we show how to combine the two models to account for dependence between views. For the task of named entity recognition, using bilingual predictors increases F1 by 16.1% absolute over a supervised monolingual model, and retraining on bilingual predictions increases monolingual model F1 by 14.6%. For syntactic parsing, our bilingual predictor increases F1 by 2.1% absolute, and retraining a monolingual model on its output gives an improvement of 2.0%.</abstract>

In our setting, this amounts to choosing: y = argmax y pM (y|x) q,12 (y|x) . (3) This is the correct decision rule if the views are independent and the labels y are uniformly distributed a priori,1 but we have deliberately introduced between-view dependence in the form of the weakened monolingual models. Equation 3 implicitly double-counts monolingual information. One way to avoid this double-counting is to simply discard the weakened monolingual models when making a joint prediction: y = argmax y max a pM (y|x) exp \x14 &amp;gt; (y1, a, y2) \x15 .

In all of these cases, multilingual models yield increased accuracy because different languages present different ambiguities and therefore offer complementary constraints on the shared underlying labels. In the present work, we consider a setting where we already possess supervised monolingual models, and wish to improve these models using unannotated bilingual parallel text (bitext). We cast this problem in the multiple-view (multiview) learning framework (Blum and Mitchell, 1998; Collins and Singer, 1999; Balcan and Blum, 2005; Ganchev et al., 2008). Our two views are a monolingual view, which uses the supervised monolingual models but not bilingual information, and a bilingual view, which exploits features that measure agreement across languages. The parameters of the bilingual view are trained to reproduce the output of the monolingual view. We show that by introducing weakened monolingual models into the bilingual view, we can optimize the parameters of the bilingual model to improve monolingual models.

Even for parsing, where the bilingual portion of the treebank is much smaller than the monolingual, our technique still can improve over purely monolingual self-training by 0.7% F1. 2 Prior Work on Learning from Bilingual Text Prior work in learning monolingual models from bitexts falls roughly into three categories: Unsupervised induction, cross-lingual projection, and bilingual constraints for supervised monolingual models. Two recent, successful unsupervised induction methods are those of Blunsom et al. (2009) and Snyder et al. (2009). Both of them estimate hierarchical Bayesian models and employ bilingual data to constrain the types of models that can be derived. Projection methods, on the other hand, were among the first applications of parallel text (after machine translation) (Yarowsky et al., 2001; Yarowsky and Ngai, 2001; Hwa et al., 2005; Ganchev et al., 2009). They assume the existence of a good, monolingual model for one language but little or no information about the second language.

We demonstrate the performance of this method on two problems. The first is named entity recognition (NER). For this problem, our method automatically learns (a variation on) earlier hand-designed rule-based bilingual NER predictors (Huang and Vogel, 2002; Moore, 2003), resulting in absolute performance gains of up to 16.1% F1. The second task we consider is statistical parsing. For this task, we follow the setup of Burkett and Klein (2008), who improved Chinese and English monolingual parsers using parallel, hand-parsed text. We achieve nearly identical improvements using a purely unlabeled bitext. These results carry over to machine translation, where we can achieve slightly better BLEU improvements than the supervised model of Burkett and Klein (2008) since we are able to train our model directly on the parallel data where we perform rule extraction. Finally, for both of our tasks, we use our bilingual model to generate additional automatically labeled monolingual training data. We compare 46 \x0cthis approach to monolingual </context>

They assume the existence of a good, monolingual model for one language but little or no information about the second language. Given a parallel sentence pair, they use the annotations for one language to heavily constrain the set of possible annotations for the other. Our work falls into the final category: We wish to use bilingual data to improve monolingual models which are already trained on large amounts of data and effective on their own (Huang and Vogel, 2002; Smith and Smith, 2004; Snyder and Barzilay, 2008; Burkett and Klein, 2008). Procedurally, our work is most closely related to that of Burkett and Klein (2008). They used an annotated bitext to learn parse reranking models for English and Chinese, exploiting features that examine pieces of parse trees in both languages. Our method can be thought of as the semi-supervised counterpart to their supervised model. Indeed, we achieve nearly the same results, but without annotated bitexts. Smith and Smith (2004) consider a similar setting for parsing both English and Korean, but instead of learning a joint model, they consider a fixed combination of two parsers and a word a</context>
<context position="7447" citStr="Burkett and Klein, 2008" startWordPosition="1136" endWordPosition="1139"> Our model consists of two views, which we will refer to as monolingual and bilingual. The monolingual view estimates the joint probability as the product of independent marginal distributions over each language, pM (y|x) = p1(y1|x1)p2(y2|x2). In our applications, these marginal distributions will be computed by stateof-the-art statistical taggers and parsers trained on large monolingual corpora. This work focuses on learning parameters for the bilingual view of the data. We parameterize the bilingual view using at most one-to-one matchings between nodes of structured labels in each language (Burkett and Klein, 2008). In this work, we use the term node to indicate a particular component of a label, such as a single (multi-word) named entity or a node in a parse tree. In Figure 2(a), for example, the nodes labeled NP1 in both the Chinese and English trees are matched. Since we dont know a priori how the components relate to one another, we treat these matchings as hidden. For each matching a and pair of labels y, we define a feature vector (y1, a, y2) which factors on edges in the matching. Our model is a conditional exponential family distribution over matchings and labels: p(y, a|x) = exp h &amp;gt; (y1, a, y2)</context>

The monolingual features are standard features for discriminative, state-of-the-art entity recognizers, and we can produce weakened monolingual models by simply limiting the feature set. The bilingual features, (y1, a, y2), are over pairs of aligned nodes, where nodes of the labels y1 and y2 are simply the individual named entities. We use a small bilingual feature set consisting of two types of features.

In Chinese, however, this ambiguity does not exist. Instead, the word , which aligns to to, has strong selectional preference for attaching to a noun on the left. In our parsing experiments, we use the Berkeley parser (Petrov et al., 2006; Petrov and Klein, 2007), a split-merge latent variable parser, for our monolingual models. Our full model is the result of training the parser with five split-merge phases. Our weakened model uses only two. For the bilingual model, we use the same bilingual feature set as Burkett and Klein (2008). Table 2 gives some examples, but does not exhaustively enumerate those features. 5 Training Bilingual Models Previous work in multiview learning has focused on the case of agreement regularization (Collins and Singer, 1999; Ganchev et al., 2008). If we had bilingual labeled data, together with our unlabeled data and monolingual labeled data, we could exploit these techniques.

This procedure iteratively updates the parameter estimates by (a) finding the optimum alignments for each candidate label pair under the current parameters and then (b) updating the parameters to maximize a modified version of Equation 1, restricted to the optimal alignments. Because we restrict alignments to the set of at most one-to-one matchings, the (a) step is tractable using the Hungarian algorithm.

In the present work, we consider a setting where we already possess supervised monolingual models, and wish to improve these models using unannotated bilingual parallel text (bitext). We cast this problem in the multiple-view (multiview) learning framework (Blum and Mitchell, 1998; Collins and Singer, 1999; Balcan and Blum, 2005; Ganchev et al., 2008). Our two views are a monolingual view, which uses the supervised monolingual models but not bilingual information, and a bilingual view, which exploits features that measure agreement across languages. The parameters of the bilingual view are trained to reproduce the output of the monolingual view. We show that by introducing weakened monolingual models into the bilingual view, we can optimize the parameters of the bilingual model to improve monolingual models.

We further simplify inference in our model by working in a reranking setting (Collins, 2000; Charniak and Johnson, 2005), where we only consider the top k outputs from monolingual models in both languages, for a total of k2 labels y. In practice, k2 10, 000 for our largest problem. 3.1 Including Weakened Models Now that we have defined our bilingual model, we could train it to agree with the output of the monolingual model (Collins and Singer, 1999; Ganchev et al., 2008). As we will see in Section 4, however, the feature functions (y1, a, y2) make no reference to the input sentences x, other than through a fixed word alignment. With such limited monolingual information, it is impossible for the bilingual model to adequately capture all of the information necessary for NER or parsing. As a simple example, a bilingual NER model will be perfectly happy to label two aligned person names as ORG instead of PER: both labelings agree equally well. We briefly illustrate how poorly such a basic bilingual model performs in Section 10. One way to solve this problem is to</context>

Our full model is the result of training the parser with five split-merge phases. Our weakened model uses only two. For the bilingual model, we use the same bilingual feature set as Burkett and Klein (2008). Table 2 gives some examples, but does not exhaustively enumerate those features. 5 Training Bilingual Models Previous work in multiview learning has focused on the case of agreement regularization (Collins and Singer, 1999; Ganchev et al., 2008). If we had bilingual labeled data, together with our unlabeled data and monolingual labeled data, we could exploit these techniques. Because we do not possess bilingual labeled data, we must train the bilingual model in another way. Here we advocate training the bilingual model (consisting of the bilingual features and weakened monolingual models) to imitate the full monolingual models. In terms of agreement regularization, our procedure may be thought of as regularizing the bilingual model to be similar to the full monolingual models.

The examples are features that would be extracted by aligning the parents of the PP nodes in Figure 2(a) (Correct) and Figure 2(b) (Incorrect). particular, the monolingual view uses monolingual models that are known to be superior to the monolingual information available in the bilingual view. Thus, we would like to find some way to incorporate the full monolingual models into our prediction method. One obvious choice is to choose the labeling that maximizes the agreement distribution (Collins and Singer, 1999; Ganchev et al., 2008). In our setting, this amounts to choosing: y = argmax y pM (y|x) q,12 (y|x) . (3) This is the correct decision rule if the views are independent and the labels y are uniformly distributed a priori,1 but we have deliberately introduced between-view dependence in the form of the weakened monolingual models. Equation 3 implicitly double-counts monolingual information. One way to avoid this double-counting is to simply discard the weakened monolingual models when making a joint prediction: y = argmax y max a pM (y|x) exp \x14 &amp;gt; (y1, a, y2) \x15 .

This observation has formed the basis for important work on syntax projection across languages (Yarowsky et al., 2001; Hwa et al., 2005; Ganchev et al., 2009) and unsupervised syntax induction in multiple languages (Snyder et al., 2009), as well as other tasks, such as cross-lingual named entity recognition (Huang and Vogel, 2002; Moore, 2003) and information retrieval (Si and Callan, 2005). In all of these cases, multilingual models yield increased accuracy because different languages present different ambiguities and therefore offer complementary constraints on the shared underlying labels. In the present work, we consider a setting where we already possess supervised monolingual models, and wish to improve these models using unannotated bilingual parallel text (bitext). We cast this problem in the multiple-view (multiview) learning framework (Blum and Mitchell, 1998; Collins and Singer, 1999; Balcan and Blum, 2005; Ganchev et al., 2008). Our two views are a monolingual view, </context>

Even for parsing, where the bilingual portion of the treebank is much smaller than the monolingual, our technique still can improve over purely monolingual self-training by 0.7% F1. 2 Prior Work on Learning from Bilingual Text Prior work in learning monolingual models from bitexts falls roughly into three categories: Unsupervised induction, cross-lingual projection, and bilingual constraints for supervised monolingual models. Two recent, successful unsupervised induction methods are those of Blunsom et al. (2009) and Snyder et al. (2009). Both of them estimate hierarchical Bayesian models and employ bilingual data to constrain the types of models that can be derived. Projection methods, on the other hand, were among the first applications of parallel text (after machine translation) (Yarowsky et al., 2001; Yarowsky and Ngai, 2001; Hwa et al., 2005; Ganchev et al., 2009).

Therefore, while we still learn good bilingual model parameters which give a sizable agreement-based boost when doing bilingual prediction, we dont expect retraining to result in a coverage-based boost in monolingual performance. 9.1 Machine Translation Experiments Although we dont have hand-labeled data for our largest Chinese-English parallel corpora, we can still evaluate our parsing results via our performance on a downstream machine translation (MT) task. Our experimental setup is as follows: first, we used the first 100,000 sentences of the EnglishChinese bitext from Wang et al. (2007) to train Moses (Koehn et al., 2007), a phrase-based MT system that we use as a baseline. We then used the same sentences to extract tree-to-string transducer rules from target-side (English) trees (Galley et al., 2004). We compare the single-reference BLEU scores of syntactic MT systems that result from using different parsers to generate these trees. 52 \x0c0.0 0.2 0.4 0.6 0.8 1.0 1.2 1.4 0.0 0.4 0.8 1.2 1.6 2.0 2.4 2.8 68-71 65-68 62-65 59-62 56-59 English Weight German Weight German F1 70.3 70.1 59.1 * + * + (a) 0.0 0.2 0.4 0.6 0.8 1.0 1.2 1.4 0.0 0.2 0.4 0.6 0.8 1.0 1.2 1.4 81.8-82.1 81.5</context>
