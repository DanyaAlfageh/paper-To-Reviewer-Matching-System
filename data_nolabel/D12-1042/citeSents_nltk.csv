In the Riedel dataset, we used the same features as CITATION and Hoffmann,,
As discussed in Section 4.3, this model follows the traditional distant supervision heuristic, similarly to CITATION.,,
collapsed all the mentions of the same entity tuple into a single datum; (b) we allow multi-label outputs for a given entity tuple at prediction time by OR-ing the predictions for the individual relation mentions corresponding to the tuple (similarly to CITATION)6; and (c) we use the simple bagging strategy described in Section 4.3 to combine multiple models.,,
Riedel This is the at-least-once model reported in CITATION, which had the best performance in that work.,,
To mitigate this issue, CITATION and Hoffman et al.,,
We constructed this second dataset using mainly resources distributed for the 2010 and 2011 KBP 3 freebase.com shared tasks (CITATION; CITATION).,,
For example, more than half of the relations in the evaluation data are alternate names of organizations or persons (e.g., org:alternate names) or relations associated with employment and membership (e.g., per:employee of) CITATION.,,

The first was developed by CITATION by aligning Freebase3 relations with the New York Times (NYT) corpus.,,
CITATION observes that evaluating on this corpus underestimates true extraction accuracy because Freebase is incomplete.,,
To mitigate this issue, CITATION and Hoffman et al.,,
hip (e.g., per:employee of) CITATION.,,
During training, for each entity tuple (e1, e2), we retrieved up to 50 sentences that contain both entity mentions.4 We used Stanfords CoreNLP package to find entity mentions in text and, similarly to CITATION, we construct relation mention candidates only between entity mentions in the same sentence.,,
