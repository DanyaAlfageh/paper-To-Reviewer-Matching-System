the major opinions in our opinion set DT ? Aspect Ordering: How can we order a subset of selected aspects A0 so as to present them in an order (A0) that is most natural with respect to human perception? New Aspects Suggestion: Can we exploit the opinions in DT to suggest new aspects to be added to the ontology? 3.1 Aspect Selection In order to align the scattered opinions to the most relevant aspects, we first use each aspect label Ai A as a query to retrieve a set of relevant opinions in the collection Si DT with a standard language modeling approach, i.e., the KL-divergence retrieval model CITATION,,
Although aspects selected in this way can effectively capture the major opinions, a major limitation is that it is generally hard to ensure that the selected phrases are well connected with the given topic CITATION,,
Consequently, some of the aspects generated are very difficult to interpret CITATION,,
Ontology is used in CITATION but only for mappi,,
However, CITATION assumes the well-writ,,
This example confirms the finding in previous work that the popular existing clusteringbased approach to aspects generation cannot generate meaningful labels CITATION,,
We use the opinion coverage-based algorithm to select 10 aspects (10-20 aspects were found to be optimal in CITATION) and then apply the coherence-based aspect ordering method,,
For all the data collections, Porter stemmer CITATION is applied and stop words are removed,,
The closest work to ours are (CITATION; ,,
This problem is similar to existing work on generating labels for clusters CITATION or topic models CITATION,,

We first extract named entities from scattered opinions DT using Stanford Named Entity Recognizer CITATION,,
The closest work to ours are (CITATION; CITATION); both try to use well-written articles for summarization,,
However, CITATION assumes the well-written article is structured with explicit or implicit aspect information, which does not always hold in practice, while CITATION needs a relatively large amount ,,
Ontology is used in CITATION but only for mapping product features,,
Different from some existing work on exploiting ontologies, e.g., CITATION, which relies on training data, we focus on exploring unsupervised approaches, which can be applied to a larger scope of topics,,

However, CITATION assumes the well-written article is structured with explicit or implicit aspect information, which does not always hold in practice, while CITATION needs a relatively large amount of training data in the given domain,,
However, CITATION as,,
