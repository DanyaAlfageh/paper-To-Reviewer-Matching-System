Thus, the derived structure resembles more a unistratal dependency representation like those used by CITATION than the multistratal representations of, for example, (Mel\&apos;~uk, 1988),,
The idea of building a projective tree by means of lifting appears in CITATION and is used by CITATION and (Hudson, unpublished),,
For a model of a DG based on tree-rewriting (in the spirit of Tree Adjoining Grammar CITATION), see CITATION,,
Thus, the derived structure resembles more a unistratal dependency representation like those used by CITATION,,
2.2 Projectivity The notion of projectivity was introduced by CITATION and has received several different definitions since then,,
See for example (CITATION; CITATION), who also discuss Early-style parsers for projective dependency grammars,,
For example, we can impose that each node x is lifted to the highest ancestor of x covered by ~2&quot; (CITATION),,
The definition given here is borrowed from CITATION and CITATION: Definition: An arc ~- is projective if and only if for every y covered by ~2-, y ~ x+,,
 is lifted to the highest ancestor of x covered by ~2&quot; (CITATION),,
CITATION), who also discuss Early-style parsers for projective dependency grammars,,
This idea can also be compared to the notion of word order domain (CITATION; CITATION), to the Slash feature of GPSG and HPSG, to the functional uncertainty of LFG, and to the Move-a of GB theory,,
