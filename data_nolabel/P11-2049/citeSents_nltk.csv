The creation of the BioScope corpus CITATION assisted in the development and evaluation of several negation/hedge scope detection systems.,,
The CoNLL2010 Shared Task CITATION focused on detecting hedges and their scopes in Wikipedia articles and biomedical texts.,,
The top three best performers on the CoNLL2010 shared task on hedge scope detection CITATION report an F1-score for correctly identified hedge cues and their scopes ranging from 55.3 to 57.3.,,
For example, CITATION examined sample BioScope sentences and developed hedging scope rules such as: The scope of a modal verb cue (e.g.,,
CITATION, CITATION, CITATION, CITATION, CITATION.,,
In addition, such an approach relies heavily on the availability of accurately parsed sentences, which could be problematic for domains such as biomedical texts (Clegg and Shepherd, 2007; CITATION).,,

We first parsed each sentence in the training dataset which contained a negation or speculation cue using the Stanford parser (CITATION; De Marneffe et al., 2006).,,

All systems described below were developed and evaluated against the BioScope corpus CITATION.,,
CITATION have developed a supervised classifier for identifying speculation cues and a manually compiled list of lexico-syntactic rules for identifying their scopes.,,
Similarly, CITATIONb) developed a machine learning system for identifying hedging cues and their scopes.,,

(2010) used a memorybased classifier based on the k-nearest neighbor rule to determine if a token is the first token in a scope sequence, the last, or neither; CITATION used a combination of manually compiled rules, a CRF classifier, and a sequence of post-processing steps on the same task; CITATION manually compiled a set of heuristics based on syntactic information taken from dependency structures.,,
