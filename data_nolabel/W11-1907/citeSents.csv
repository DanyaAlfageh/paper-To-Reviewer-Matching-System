Some of the features described in CITATION had to be changed to cope with the OntoNotes data,,
oolkit CITATION,,
e resolution on MUC and ACE data CITATION, the move to the OntoNotes data CITATION required mainly to update the mention detector and the feature set,,
We use the Stanford MaxentTagger CITATION for partof-speech tagging, and the Stanford Named Entity,,
2 Preprocessing COPA is implemented on top of the BART-toolkit CITATION,,
eech tagging, and the Stanford Named Entity Recognizer CITATION for annotating named entities,,
Documents are transformed into the MMAX2-format CITATION which allows for easy visualization and (linguistic) debugging,,
3.2.2 HGResolver In order to partition the hypergraph we adopt a spectral clustering algorithm CITATION,,
While we implemented this information as weak positive features in CITATION, here we apply these features before graph construction as global variables,,
one of the ACE entity type CITATION), and the anaphor is a definite expression of the same type,,
In order to derive syntactic information, we use the Charniak/Johnson reranking parser CITATION c,,
All instances derived from the same type have the same weight, but they may get reweighed by the distance feature (see CITATION),,
In order to derive syntactic information, we use the Charniak/Johnson reranking parser CITATION com56 \x0cbined with a constituent-to-dependency conversion Tool (http://nlp.cs.lth.se/software/ treebank_converter),,
We apply the recursive variant of spectral clustering, recursive 2-way partitioning (R2 partitioner) CITATION,,
tion is then performed globally in one step by partitioning the hypergraph into subhypergraphs so that all mentions in one subhypergraph refer to the same entity CITATION,,
he CoNLL shared task on modeling unrestricted coreference CITATION,,
We use the Stanford MaxentTagger CITATION for partof-speech tagging, and the Stanford Named Entity Recognizer CITATION for annotating named entities,,
While COPA has been developed originally to perform coreference resolution on MUC and ACE data CITATION, the move to the OntoNotes data CITATION required mainly to update the mention detector and the feature set,,
We have implemented an in-house mention detector, which makes use of the parsing output, the partof-speech tags, as well as the chunks from the Yamcha Chunker CITATION,,
Coreference resolution is then performed globally in one step by partitioning the hypergraph into subhypergraphs so that all mentions in one subhypergraph refer to the same entity CITATION,,
Since several off-the-shelf preprocessing components are used, COPA participated in the open setting of the CoNLL shared task on modeling unrestricted coreference CITATION,,
In order to derive syntactic information, we use the Charniak/Johnson reranking parser CITATION com56 \x0cbined with a constituent-to-dependency conversion Tool (http://nlp,,
CITATION) are actually positive coreference indicators,,
