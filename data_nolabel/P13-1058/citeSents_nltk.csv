3), and PropBank CITATION,,
After predicting all morphological features, the information required to generate inflected forms is complete: based on the stems and the features, we use the morphological tool SMOR CITATION for the generation of inflected forms,,
This outcome, in particular that adding the lemma of the preposition to the PP node helps to improve translation quality, has been observed before in tree restructuring work for improving translation CITATION,,
CITATIONa), CITATIONb), CITATION, CITATION),,
This basic kind of verb knowledge has been shown to be useful in many NLP tasks such as information extraction (CITATION; Venturi1 et al., 2009), parsing (CITATION; CITATION) and word sense disambiguation (CITATION; McCarthy et al,,
On the one hand, this has led to a range of manually or semi-automatically developed lexical resources focusing on verb information, such as the Levin classes CITATION, VerbNet (Kipper CITATION), FrameNet4 CITATION, and PropBank CITATION,,
CITATION and CITATION built translation systems that predict inflected word forms based on a large array of morphological and syntactic features, obtained from both source and target side,,
This basic kind of verb knowledge has been shown to be useful in many NLP tasks such as information extraction (CITATION; Venturi1 et al., 2009), parsing (CITATION; CITATION) and word sense disambiguation (Ko,,
The German part of Europarl was dependencyparsed with CITATION, and subcategorization information was extracted as described in CITATION; the newspaper data (HGC - Huge German Corpus) was parsed with CITATION, and subcategorization information was extracted as described in Schulte im CITATIONb),,
The German part of Europarl was dependencyparsed with CITATION, and subcategorization information ,,
Our approach is in line with 594 \x0cCITATIONb) who demonstrated that on the one hand 84% of verb syntactic functions in a 50-sentence test corpus projected from Chinese to English, and that on the other hand about 15% of the subjects were not translated into subjects, but their semantic roles were preserved across language,,
This basic kind of verb knowledge has been shown to be useful in many NLP tasks such as information extraction (CITATION; Venturi1 et al., 2009), parsing (CITATION; CITATION) and word sense disambiguation (CITATION; CITATION),,

We present three types of evaluation: BLEU scores CITATION, prediction accuracy on clean data and a manual evaluation of the best system in section 5.3,,
In contrast to the flat phrase-based setting of CITATION, syntactic trees on the SMT output allow,,
CITATION for English; CITATION for Czech; Schulte im CITATIONa) for German; CITATION for French,,
The rule table was computed with the default parameter setting for GHKM extraction CITATION in the implementation by CITATION,,
This basic kind of verb knowledge has been shown to be useful in many NLP tasks such as information extraction (CITATION; Venturi1 et al., 2009), parsing (Carroll et a,,
3.1 Stemmed representation/feature markup We first parse the German side of the parallel training data with BitPar CITATION,,
Kholy and Habash (2012) and CITATION work on English to Arabic translation and model gender, number and definiteness, focusing primarily on improving fluency,,
In contrast, the adjectival inflection model in CITATION is independent from the other features,,
Instead of translating phrases, a hierarchical system extracts translation rules CITATION which allow the decoder to provide a tree spanning over the translated sentence,,
While the CRF used for case prediction in CITATION ha,,
CITATION used a phrase-based system to transfer stems and generated inflected forms based on the stems and their morphological features,,
This problem was also mentioned by CITATION and Kholy and Habash (2012),,
The English features are obtained from dependency-parsed data CITATION,,
For predicting the grammatical features, we used the Wapiti Toolkit CITATION.10 9 English/German data released for the 2009 ACL Workshop on Machine Translation shared task,,
CITATION evaluated user reactions to different error types in machine translation and came to the result that morphological well-formedness has only a marginal impact on the comprehensibility of SMT output in the case of English-Spanish translation,,
e used the Wapiti Toolkit CITATION.10 9 English/German data released for the 2009 ACL Workshop on Machine Translation shared task,,
In contrast to the flat phrase-based setting of CITATION, syntactic trees on the SMT output allow us to work with verbnoun structures, which are relevant for case prediction,,

ocusing on verb information, such as the Levin classes CITATION, VerbNet (Kipper CITATION), FrameNet4 CITATION, and PropBank CITATION,,
One problem with using BLEU as an evaluation metric is that it is a precision-oriented metric and tends to reward fluency rather than adequacy (see (CITATIONa; CITATION)),,
