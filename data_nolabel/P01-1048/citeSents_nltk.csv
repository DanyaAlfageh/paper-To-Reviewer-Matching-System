nation with other information already available to the recognizer, can distinguish user turns that are misrecognized by the system far better than traditional methods used in ASR rejection (CITATION; CITATION),,
These findings are consistent with previous research showing that corrections tend to be hyperarticulated higher, louder, longer ...than other turns (CITATION; CITATION; CITATION; CITATION),,
We represent each user turn using the feature set shown in Figure 2, which we previously found useful for predicting corrections CITATION,,
In particular, we found that prosodic features, in combination with other information already available to the recognizer, can distinguish user turns that are misrecognized by the system far better than traditional methods used in ASR rejection (CITATION; CITATION),,
In this way, they are similar to what others have termed go-back signals CITATION,,
In human-human interaction, dialogue partners apply sophisticated strategies to detect and correct communication failures so that errors of recognition and understanding rarely lead to a complete breakdown of the interaction CITATION,,
ormation already available to the recognizer, can distinguish user turns that are misrecognized by the system far better than traditional methods used in ASR rejection (CITATION; CITATION),,
Finally, given that our previous studies showed that preceding dialogue context may affect correction behavior (CITATION; CITATION), we included a feature (diadist) reflecting the distance of the current turn from the beginning of the dialogue, and a set of features summarizing aspects of the prior dialogue: for the latter features, we included both the number of times prior turns exhibited certain characteristics (e.g,,
Given that, in current systems, both corrections and restarts often lead to recognition error CITATION, aware sites may be useful in preparing systems to deal with such problems,,

This section describes experiments using the machine learning program RIPPER CITATION to automatically induce prediction models from our data,,
CITATION,,
We also found that user corrections of system misrecognitions exhibit certain typical prosodic features, which can be used to identify such turns (CITATION; CITATION),,
