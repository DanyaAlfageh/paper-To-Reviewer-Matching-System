CITATION investigate the influences of input difficulty on summarization performance,,
CITATION present a language-independent approach for extractive summarization based on the linear optimization of several sentence ranking measures using a genetic algorithm,,
ciple (CITATION; CITATION),,
For multi-document summarization, some sentences are highly overlapping with each other, and thus we apply the same greedy algorithm in CITATION to penalize the sentences highly overlapping with other highly scored sentences, and finally the salient and novel Chinese sentences are directly selected as summary sentences,,
CITATION propose an A* search algorithm to find the best extractive summary up to a given length, and they propose a discriminative training alg,,
We used the ROUGE-1.5.5 CITATION toolkit for evaluation, which has been widely adopted by DUC and TAC for automatic summarization evaluation,,
 In recent years, graph-based methods have been proposed for sentence ranking (Erkan and Radev, 2004; CITATION),,
Machine learning techniques have been used for sentence ranking (CITATION; CITATION),,
CITATION propose to generate a Japanese summary by using Korean summarizer,,
CITATION propose to produce summaries with the MMR method from Romanian news articles and then automatically translate the summaries into English,,
CITATION adopt the summary translation scheme for the task of English-to-Chinese cross,,
1 Introduction Cross-language document summarization is defined as the task of producing a summary in a different target language for a set of documents in a source language CITATION,,
In future work, we will investigate to use the machine translation quality factor to further improve the fluency of the Chinese summary, as in CITATION,,
In the task of single document summarization, various features have been investigated for ranking sentences in a document, including term frequency, sentence position, cue words, stigma words, and topic signature (CITATION; CITATION),,
requency, sentence position, cue words, stigma words, and topic signature (CITATION; CITATION),,
Machine Learning techniques have also been used for feature combining CITATION,,
Other related work includes multilingual summarization (CITATION; CITATION), which aims to create summaries from multiple sources in multiple languages,,
CITATION,,
In the task of multi-document summarization, the centroid-based method CITATION ranks the sentences in a document set based on such features as cluster centroids, position and TFIDF,,
CITATION present a systematic assessment of several diverse classes of metrics designed for automatic evaluation of linguistic quality of multi-document summaries,,
For example CITATION use machine translation for English headline generation for Hindi documents,,
Graph-based methods have also been used to rank sentences for multi-document summarization (CITATION; CITATION),,
Cross language query based summarization has been investigated in CITATION, where the query and the documents are in different languages,,
CITATION formulate extractive summarization as a two-step learning problem by building a generative model for pattern discovery and a regression model for inference,,
CITATION propose an A* search algorithm to find the best extractive summary up to a given length, and they propose a discriminative training algorithm for directly maximizing the quality of the best summary,,
