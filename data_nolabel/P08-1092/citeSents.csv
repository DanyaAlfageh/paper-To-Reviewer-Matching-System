We further assume that these documents have been tagged with Named Entities (NE)s with coreferences resolved 807 \x0cusing a system such as NYUs 2005 ACE system CITATION, which we used for our experiments,,
nd inter-rater agreement for these judgments using Fleiss kappa CITATION to be only moderate (=0.362),,
CITATIONs biography generation system, like ours, trains biographical and non-biographical sentence classifiers to select sentences to be included in the biography,,
A similar approach is explored in CITATION, which uses Topic Signatures (Lin and H,,
The problem of ordering sentences and preserving coherence in MDS is addressed by CITATION, who combine chronological ordering of events with cohesion metrics,,
We used the weighted kappa statistic with quadratic weighting CITATION to determine the inter-rater agreement, obtaining a mean pairwise of 0.441,,
SVM regression has recently been used by CITATION for sentence ranking for general MDS,,
We found inter-rater agreement for these judgments using Fleiss kappa CITATION to be only moderate (=0.362),,
We run NYUs 2005 ACE system CITATION to tag NEs and do coreference resolution,,
Similar to CITATION, we automatically learn how to order our biographical sentences by observing the typical order of presentation of information in a particular domain,,
CITATION models kernel-fact features typical for biographies using linguistic and semantic processing,,
We evaluate first using the ROUGE-L metric CITATION with a 95% (ROUGE computed) confidence interval for all systems and compared these to the ROUGE-L score of the best-performing DUC2004 system.5 The higher the ROUGE score, the closer the summary is to the DUC2004 human reference summaries,,

 and semantic features are the set of biography-related relations and events defined in the ACE guidelines CITATION,,
ur top-DUC2004 in Section 5, was CITATIONa)s DefScriber, which treats Who is X? as a definition question and targets definitional themes (e.g,,
Using the training data described above, we experimented with three different classification algorithms using the Weka machine learning toolkit CITATION: multinomial nave Bayes, SVM with linear kernel, and C4.5,,

One might collect training data by manually annotating a suitable corpus containing biographical and nonbiographical data about a person, as in CITATION,,
A similar approach is explored in CITATION, which uses Topic Signatures CITATION constructed around the target individuals name to identify sentences to be included in the biography,,
Extracted sentences are then rewritten using a reference rewriting system CITATION which attempts to shorten subsequent references to the target,,
CITATION use HMMs to capture topic shift within a particular domain; sequence of topic shifts then guides the subsequent ordering of sentences within the summary,,
Linguistic features 813 \x0care derived from predicate-argument structures deduced from parse trees, and semantic features are the set of biography-related relations and events defined in the ACE guidelines CITATION,,
For each machine learning algorithm tested, we build a system that initially classifies the input list of sentences into biographical and non-biographical sentences and then 3 http://duc.nist.gov/duc2004 4 Note that this system out-performed 19 of the 22 systems on ROUGE-1 and 20 of 22 on ROUGE-L and ROUGE-W-1.2 (p &lt; .05) (CITATIONa),,
