CITATION used Gibbs sampling, a simple Monte Carlo method used to perform approximate inference in factored probabilistic models,,
Patwardhan and Riloff CITATION proposed an event extraction model which consists of two components: a model for sentential event recognition, which offers a probabilistic assessment of whether a sentence is discussing a domain-relevant event; and a model for recognizing plausible role fillers, which identifies phrases as role fillers based upon the assumption that the surrounding context is discussing a relevant event,,
However, there have been several studies using high-level information from a wider scope: CITATION use discourse trees and local syntactic dependencies in a patternbased framework to incorporate wider context to refine the performance of relation extraction,,
Patwardhan and Riloff CITATION proposed an event extraction model which,,
CITATION used cross-event,,
CITATION propose document level cross-event inference to improve event extraction,,
CITATION were inspired from the hypothesis of One Sense Per Discourse (Ya1 Selected from the file CNN_CF_20030304.1900.02 in ACE-2005 corpus,,

CITATION used cross-event information within ACE extraction, but only for recovering implicit time information for events,,
