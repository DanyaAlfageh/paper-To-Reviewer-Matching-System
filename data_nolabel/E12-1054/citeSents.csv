CITATION used a characteristic gap in the standard evaluation dataset by CITATION that separates unrelated from related word pairs,,
Some measures using a wider definition of semantic relatedness (CITATION; CITATIONb) instead of only using taxonomic relations in a knowledge source,,
(1991), CITATION found that it outperformed the knowledge-based method by CITATION when evaluated on a corpus of artificial errors based on the WSJ corpus,,
Both - the statistical as well as the knowledge-based approach - will benefit from a better model of the typist, as not all edit operations are equally likely CITATION,,
For this purpose, we applied the Stanford NER CITATION,,
ter recognition CITATION, co-reference resolution CITATION, or malapropism detection CITATION,,
In contrast to the findings of CITATION, JiangConrath is not the best path-based measure, as Lin provides equal or better performance,,
se, we applied the Stanford NER CITATION,,
(1991) and the knowledge-based approach by CITATION on the task of detecting realword spelling errors,,
For that purpose, knowledge-based approaches employ the structural knowledge encoded in lexical-semantic networks like WordNet CITATION, while statistical approaches rely on co-occurrence counts collected from large corpora, e.g,,
 based on the Google Web1T n-gram counts CITATION,,
 together with the JWPL Wikipedia API (CITATIONa).3 The API outputs plain text converted from Wiki-Markup, but the text still contains a small portion of leftover markup and other artifacts,,
However, annotation of errors is difficult and costly CITATION, only a small fraction of observed errors will be real-word spelling errors, and learners are likely to make dif535 \x0cferent mistakes than proficient language users,,

5.1 Statistical Approach Table 1 summarizes the results obtained by the statistical approach using a trigram model based on the Google Web1T data CITATION,,
For this purpose, we use WordNet CITATION for English and GermaNet CITATION for German,,
So far, evaluation of contextual fitness measures relied on artificial datasets (Mays et al., 1991; CITATION) which are created by taking a sentence that is known to be correct, and replacing a word with a similar word from the vocabulary,,
So far, evaluation of contextual fitness measures relied on artificial datasets (Mays et al., 1991; CITATION) which are created by taking a sentence that is known to be correct, and replacing a word with a similar word from the vocab,,
006), the measure by CITATION yields the best results,,
CITATION presented another statistical approach using the Google Web1T data CITATION to create the n-gram model,,
(1991), CITATION found that it ou,,
CITATION used similar techniques to create a dataset of errors from the French Wikipedia,,
Previous work on evaluating real-word spelling correction (CITATION; WilcoxOHearn et al., 2008; CITATION) used a dataset sampled from the Wall Street Journal corpus which is not freely available,,
In addition, we test another path-based measure by CITATION, the gloss-based measure by CITATION, and the ESA measure CITATION based on concept vectors from Wikipedia, Wiktionary, and WordNet,,
e Google Web1T data CITATION to create the n-gram model,,
Existing measures of contextual fitness can be categorized into knowledge-based CITATION and statistical methods (Mays et al., 1991; CITATION),,
However, real-word spelling correction has also been tackled by supervised approaches (CITATION; CITATION; CITATION),,
Thus, we use a frequency filter based on the Google Web1T n-gram counts CITATION,,

Besides typing mistakes, a major source of such errors is the failed attempt of automatic spelling correctors to correct a misspelled word CITATION,,

1 Introduction Measuring the contextual fitness of a term in its context is a key component in different NLP applications like speech recognition CITATION, optical character recognition CITATION, co-reference resolution CITATION, or malapropism detection CITATION,,
2.1 Accessing the Revision Data We access the Wikipedia revision data using the freely available Wikipedia Revision Toolkit CITATION together with the JWPL Wikipedia API (CITATIONa).3 The API outputs plain text converted from Wiki-Markup, but the text still contains a small portion of leftover markup and other artifacts,,
4.2 Knowledge Based Approach CITATION introduced a knowledge-based approach that detects real-word spelling errors by checking the semantic relations of a target word with its context,,
Another possible source of real-word spelling errors are learner corpora CITATION, e.g,,
For the resulting much smaller subset of sentence pairs, we compute the Jaro distance CITATION between each pair,,

Recently, the revision history of Wikipedia has been introduced as a valuable knowledge source for NLP (CITATION; CITATION),,
In the experiments by CITATION, the measure by CITATION yields the best results,,
