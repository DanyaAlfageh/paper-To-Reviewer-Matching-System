MERT is currently optimising towards BLEU, but the final score for ranking the answers is a combination of a smoothed BLEU, ROUGE, L and E. It has been shown that optimising towards the same metric used to evaluate the system is beneficial for translation, but also that BLEU is one of the most robust metrics to be used CITATION, so the issue has to be investigated for the QA problem.,,

With the exception of the query expansion ap21 \x0cproaches CITATION, all works discussed here use some form of noisy-channel model (translation model and target language model) but do not perform the decoding part of the SMT process to generate translations, nor use the rich set of features of a full SMT.,,
In fact, the formulation of the noisy-channel in these works has very few differences with pure language modelling approaches to QA like the one of CITATION, where two different models for retrieval and filtering are learnt from a corpus of questionanswer pairs.,,
