In fact, our system is more similar in spirit to that of CITATION, which learns regular expressions to find answer contexts and shows significant improvements for out-ofdomain test sets, that is web data,,
Word alignment is done with GIZA++ CITATION and both phrase extraction and decoding are done with the Moses package CITATION,,
CITATION approach the task of passage retrieval for QA with translations of dependency parsing relations,,
CITATION firstly propose a probabilistic approach to IR based on metho,,
CITATION implement a similar strategy but with a richer formulation and targeted to open-domain QA,,
This result is in the lowest part of the table reported by the official TREC-11 overview CITATION,,
This classifier is built following the approach of CITATION, it can classify questions into 53 different answer types and belongs to our in-house QA system,,
The results of sentence ranking of our system are similar to those obtained by CITATION, however, since test sets are different they are not directly comparable,,
The work of CITATION applies the same strategy to TREC data,,
CITATION firstly propose a probabilistic approach to IR based on methods of SMT,,
In contrast, CITATION introduce an SMT-based method for extracting the concrete answer in factoid QA,,
CITATION extend the scope of this approach,,
With the exception of the query expansion ap21 \x0cproaches CITATION, all works discussed here use some form of noisy-channel model (translation model and target language model) but do not perform the decoding part of the SMT process to generate translations, nor use the rich set of features of a full SMT,,
The key ingredient is the set of translation probabilities p(q|a) from IBM model 1 CITATION,,
CITATION approach the task of passage retrieval for QA with translations ,,
The log-linear model CITATION, a generalisation of the original noisy-channel approach (Eq,,
In fact, the formulation of the noisy-channel in these works has very few differences with pure language modelling approaches to QA like the one of CITATION, where two different models for retrieval and filtering are learnt from a corpus of questionanswer pairs,,
For this optimisation one may use Minimum Error Rate Training (MERT) CITATION where BLEU CITATION is the reference evaluation,,
also introduce the formulation of the QA problem in terms of SMT CITATION,,
CITATION firstly propose a probabilistic approach to,,
we use the TnT POS tagger CITATION, WordNet CITATION, the YamCha chunker CITATION, the Stanford NERC CITATION, and an in-house temporal expressions recogniser,,
CITATION define the problem of answer retrieval from FAQ and social Q/A websites as a query expansion problem,,
It has been shown that optimising towards the same metric used to evaluate the system is beneficial for translation, but also that BLEU is one of the most robust metrics to be used CITATION, so the issue has to be investigated for the QA problem,,
QA has attracted the attention of researchers for some years, and several public evaluations have been recently carried in the TREC, CLEF, and NTCIR conferences (CITATION; CITATION; CITATION),,
Description of these collections can be found in the TREC overviews (CITATION; CITATION),,
The language model is estimated using interpolated Kneser-Ney discounting with SRILM CITATION,,
using translation models to determine the answers (CITATION; CITATION; CITATION),,
The other metric is ROUGE CITATION, here named R,,
The QA problem can be approached from several points of view, ranging from simple surface pattern matching CITATION, to automated reasoning CITATION or supercomputing CITATION,,
It is not the first time that SMT is used for QA tasks, several works have been using translation models to determine the answers (CITATION; CITATION; CITATION),,
CITATION extend the scope of this approach by combining together the translation probabilities of words, dependency relations, and semantic roles in the context of answer searching in FAQ collections,,
One of them is a lexical metric commonly used in machine translation, BLEU CITATION,,
In the same context, CITATION study methods for improving the translation quality removing noise from the parallel corpus,,
The approach of CITATION that uses translation probabilities to rank the answers achieves higher results on the same data set (an MRR of 0.325 versus our 0.141),,
CITATION Level1 Q: What is Karl Malones nickname ? Level1 A: Malone , whose overall consistency has earned him the nickname ANSWER , missed both of them with nine seconds remaining ,,
