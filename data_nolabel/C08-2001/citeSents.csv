It certainly has not helped that most of the computational developments on metaphor processing have largely been stand-alone systems that are not empirically evaluated on a large scale (CITATION; CITATION; CITATION; CITATION; CITATION),,
RTE is considered central for the development of intelligent yet robust natural language processing systems because most of the semantic inference needed in natural language applications such as QA and IE can be characterized as problems in RTE CITATION,,
This type of open-ended metaphors have been subjected to a in-depth analysis (both formal and computational) within the ATT-Meta system and approach for metaphor interpretation (CITATION; CITATION),,
2.2 Metaphor in RTE Challenges Even though annotators aimed to filter out metaphorical uses of language from the RTE datasets CITATION, some metaphorical texts have eluded the annotators selection policies CITATION,,
Lakoff and associates argue that source to target correspondences are part of more general schemes called conceptual metaphors CITATION which we call metaphorical views,,
It makes very difficult to isolate the semantic task from the task of retrieving the necessary background knowledge (CITATION; CITATION),,
RTE aims to be an abstract and generic task that captures major semantic inference needs across applications CITATION,,
