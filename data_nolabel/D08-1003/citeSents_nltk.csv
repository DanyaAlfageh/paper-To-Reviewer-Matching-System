1.1 Learning Regular Expressions The problem of inducing regular languages from positive and negative examples has been studied in the past, even outside the context of information extraction (CITATION; Dupont, 1996; Firoiu et al., 1998; Garofalakis et al., 2000; CITATION; Denis et al., 2004; CITATION; Galassi and Giordana, 2005; Bex et al., 2006).,,
While multiple machine learning approaches have been proposed for information extraction in recent years (McCallum et al., 2000; CITATION; Klein et al., 2003; CITATION), manually created regexes remain a widely adopted practical solution for information extraction (CITATION; Fukuda et al., 1998; CITATION; CITATION; Li et al., 2006; DeRose et al., 2007; Zhu et al., 2007).,,
A common theme in (CITATION; CITATION; CITATION; Feldman et al., 2006) is the problem of learning regexes over tagged tokens produced by other text-processing steps such as POS tagging, morphological analysis, and gazetteer matching.,,
A similar approach has been proposed in CITATION for POS disambiguation.,,
