We use the Prover9 CITATION theorem prover for inference, returning yes if the premise implies the hypothesis, no if it implies the negation of the hypothesis, and unknown otherwise,,

d Work Much work on semantics has taken place in a supervised settingfor example the GeoQuery CITATION and ATIS CITATION semantic parsing tasks,,
Our approach is similar to CITATION in that we aim to cluster entities based on the noun and unary predicates applied to them (it is simple to convert from the binary predicates to unary predicates),,
CITATION make progress towards this by learning a classifier that can recognise entailments such as all dogs = some dogs, but this remains some way from the power of first-order theorem proving of the kind required by the problem in Figure 5,,
We use the C&C parser CITATION, trained on CCGBank CITATION, using the refined version of CITATION which brings the syntax closer to the predicateargument structure,,
For example, CITATION propose a series of LDAbased models which cluster relations between entities based on a variety of lexical, syntactic and semantic features,,
2 Background Our approach is based on Combinatory Categorial Grammar (CCG; CITATION), a strongly lexicalised theory of language in which lexical entries for words contain all language-specific information,,

Following CITATION, we do not use held-out data each problem is designed to test a different issue, so it is not possible to generalize from one subset of the suite to another,,
