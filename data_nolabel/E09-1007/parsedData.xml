Abstract

<bodyText confidence="0.996957">
We propose a system which builds, in a
semi-supervised manner, a resource that
aims at helping a NER system to anno-
tate corpus-specific named entities. This
system is based on a distributional ap-
proach which uses syntactic dependen-
cies for measuring similarities between
named entities. The specificity of the
presented method however, is to combine
a clique-based approach and a clustering
technique that amounts to a soft clustering
method. Our experiments show that the
resource constructed by using this clique-
based clustering system allows to improve
different NER systems.

<bodyText confidence="0.99192065">
In Information Extraction domain, named entities
(NEs) are one of the most important textual units
as they express an important part of the meaning
of a document. Named entity recognition (NER)
is not a new domain (see MUC1 and ACE2 confer-
ences) but some new needs appeared concerning
NEs processing. For instance the NE Oxford illus-
trates the different ambiguity types that are inter-
esting to address:
intra-annotation ambiguity: Wikipedia lists
more than 25 cities named Oxford in the world
systematic inter-annotation ambiguity: the
name of cities could be used to refer to the uni-
versity of this city or the football club of this
city. This is the case for Oxford or Newcastle
non-systematic inter-annotation ambiguity:
Oxford is also a company unlike Newcastle.
The main goal of our system is to act in a com-
plementary way with an existing NER system, in
order to enhance its results. We address two kinds

of issues: first, we want to detect and correctly
annotate corpus-specific NEs3 that the NER sys-
tem could have missed; second, we want to correct
some wrong annotations provided by the existing
NER system due to ambiguity. In section 3, we
give some examples of such corrections.
The paper is organized as follows. We present,
in section 2, the global architecture of our system
and from 2.1 to 2.6, we give details about each
of its steps. In section 3, we present the evalu-
ation of our approach when it is combined with
other classic NER systems. We show that the re-
sulting hybrid systems perform better with respect
to F-measure. In the best case, the latter increased
by 4.84 points. Furthermore, we give examples of
successful correction of NEs annotation thanks to
our approach. Then, in section 4, we discuss about
related works. Finally we sum up the main points
of this paper in section 5.

<bodyText confidence="0.9868185625">
Given a corpus, the main objectives of our system
are: to detect potential NEs; to compute the possi-
ble annotations for each NE and then; to annotate
each occurrence of these NEs with the right anno-
tation by analyzing its local context.
We assume that this corpus dependent approach
allows an easier NE annotation. Indeed, even if
a NE such as Oxford can have many annotation
types, it will certainly have less annotation possi-
bilities in a specific corpus.
Figure 1 presents the global architecture of our
system. The most important part concerns steps
3 (2.3) and 4 (2.4). The aim of these sub-
processes is to group NEs which have the same
annotation with respect to a given context. On
the one hand, clique-based methods (see 2.3 for

details on cliques) are interesting as they allow
the same NE to be in different cliques. In other
words, cliques allow to represent the different pos-
sible annotations of a NE. The clique-based ap-
proach drawback however, is the over production
of cliques which corresponds to an artificial over
production of possible annotations for a NE. On
the other hand, clustering methods aim at struc-
turing a data set and such techniques can be seen
as data compression processes. However, a sim-
ple NEs hard clustering doesnt allow a NE to be
in several clusters and thus to express its differ-
ent annotations. Then, our proposal is to combine
both methods in a clique-based clustering frame-
work. This combination leads to a soft-clustering
approach that we denote CBC system. The fol-
lowing paragraphs, from 2.1 to 2.6, describe the
respective steps mentioned in Figure 1.

2.1 Detection of potential Named Entities
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.779155476190476">
Different methods exist for detecting potential
NEs. In our system, we used some lexico-
syntactic constraints to extract expressions from a
corpus because it allows to detect some corpus-
specific NEs. In our approach, a potential NE is a
noun starting with an upper-case letter or a noun
phrase which is (see (Ehrmann and Jacquet, 2007)
for similar use):
a governor argument of an attribute syntactic
relation with a noun as governee argument (e.g.
president
attribute
George Bush)
a governee argument of a modifier syntactic re-
lation with a noun as a governor argument (e.g.
company
modifier
Coca-Cola).
The list of potential NEs extracted from the cor-
pus will be denoted NE and the number of NEs
|NE|.

2.2 Distributional space of NEs
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.963947033333333">
The distributional approach aims at evaluating a
distance between words based on their syntac-
tic distribution. This method assumes that words
which appear in the same contexts are semanti-
cally similar (Harris, 1951).
To construct the distributional space associated
to a corpus, we use a robust parser (in our ex-
periments, we used XIP parser (At et al., 2002))
to extract chunks (i.e. nouns, noun phrases, ...)
and syntactic dependencies between these chunks.
Given this parsers output, we identify triple in-
stances. Each triple has the form w1.R.w2 where
w1 and w2 are chunks and R is a syntactic relation
(Lin, 1998), (Kilgarriff et al., 2004).
One triple gives two contexts (1.w1.R and
2.w2.R) and two chunks (w1 and w2). Then, we
only select chunks w which belong to NE. Each
point in the distributional space is a NE and each
dimension is a syntactic context. CT denotes the
set of all syntactic contexts and |CT |represents its
cardinal.
We illustrate this construction on the sentence
provide Albania with food aid. We obtain the
three following triples (note that aid and food aid
are considered as two different chunks):
provide VERBI-OBJAlbania NOUN
provide VERBPREP WITHaid NOUN
provide VERBPREP WITHfood aid NP
From these triples, we have the following
chunks and contexts4:

scribed previously, we only keep the chunks and
contexts which are in bold in the above table.

\x0cWe also use an heuristic in order to reduce the
over production of chunks and contexts: in our ex-
periments for example, each NE and each context
should appear more than 10 times in the corpus for
being considered.
D is the resulting (|NE ||CT|) NE-Context
matrix where ei : i = 1, . . . , |NE |is a NE and
cj : j = 1, . . . , |CT |is a syntactic context. Then
we have:

2.3 Cliques of NEs computation
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999536869565217">
A clique in a graph is a set of pairwise adja-
cent nodes which is equivalent to a complete sub-
graph. A maximal clique is a clique that is not a
subset of any other clique. Maximal cliques com-
putation was already employed for semantic space
representation (Ploux and Victorri, 1998). In this
work, cliques of lexical units are used to represent
a precise meaning. Similarly, we compute cliques
of NEs in order to represent a precise annotation.
For example, Oxford is an ambiguous NE
but a clique such as &amp;lt;Cambridge, Oxford, Ed-
inburgh University, Edinburgh, Oxford Univer-
sity&amp;gt; allows to focus on the specific annota-
tion &amp;lt;organization&amp;gt; (see (Ehrmann and Jacquet,
2007) for similar use).
Given the distributional space described in the
previous paragraph, we use a probabilistic frame-
work for computing similarities between NEs.
The approach that we propose is inspired from
the language modeling framework introduced in
the information retrieval field (see for example
(Lavrenko and Croft, 2003)). Then, we construct
cliques of NEs based on these similarities.

as a flexible k-nearest neighbor method. In our

2.4 Cliques clustering
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999618">
We use a clustering technique in order to group
cliques of NEs which are mutually highly simi-
lar. The clusters of cliques which contain a NE
allow to find the different possible annotations of
this NE.
This clustering technique must be able to con-
struct pure clusters in order to have precise an-
notations. In that case, it is desirable to avoid
fixing the number of clusters. Thats the reason
why we propose to use the Relational Analysis ap-
proach described below.
</bodyText>
<subsubsectionHeader confidence="0.889857">
2.4.1 The Relational Analysis approach
</subsubsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.983711615384615">
We propose to apply the Relational Analysis ap-
proach (RA) which is a clustering model that
doesnt require to fix the number of clusters
(Michaud and Marcotorchino, 1980), (Bedecarrax
and Warnesson, 1989). This approach takes as in-
put a similarity matrix. In our context, since we
want to cluster cliques of NEs, the correspond-
ing similarity matrix S between cliques is given
by the dot products matrix taken from T: S =
T T0. The general term of this similarity matrix
is: S(clik, clik0 ) = Skk0 = hclik, clik0 i. Then, we
want to maximize the following clustering func-
tion:
</bodyText>
<equation confidence="0.998062538461539">
(S, X) = (6)

 |{z }
contkk0
Xkk0
where S+ = {(clik, clik0 ) : Skk0 &amp;gt; 0}.
</equation>
<bodyText confidence="0.67102025">
In other words, clik and clik0 have more chances
to be in the same cluster providing that their sim-
ilarity measure, Skk0 , is greater or equal to the
mean average of positive similarities.
X is the solution we are looking for. It is a bi-
nary relational matrix with general term: Xkk0 =
1, if clik is in the same cluster as clik0 ; and Xkk0 =
0, otherwise. X represents an equivalence rela-
tion. Thus, it must respect the following proper-
ties:
binarity: Xkk0 {0, 1}; k, k0,
reflexivity: Xkk = 1; k,
</bodyText>
<equation confidence="0.608181333333333">
symmetry: Xkk0 Xk0k = 0; k, k0,
transitivity: Xkk0 + Xk0k00 Xkk00
1; k, k0, k00.
</equation>
<bodyText confidence="0.993903285714286">
As the objective function is linear with respect
to X and as the constraints that X must respect are
linear equations, we can solve the clustering prob-
lem using an integer linear programming solver.
However, this problem is NP-hard. As a result, in
practice, we use heuristics for dealing with large
data sets.

The presented heuristic is quite similar to another
algorithm described in (Hartigan, 1975) known as
the leader algorithm. But unlike this last ap-
proach which is based upon euclidean distances
and inertial criteria, the RA heuristic aims at max-
imizing the criterion given in (6). A sketch of this
heuristic is given in Algorithm 1, (see (Marco-

<bodyText confidence="0.998542523809524">
So far, the different steps that we have introduced
were unsupervised. In this paragraph, our aim is to
give a correct annotation to each cluster (hence, to
all NEs in this cluster). To this end, we need some
annotation seeds and we propose two different
semi-supervised approaches (regarding the classi-
fication given in (Nadeau and Sekine, 2007)). The
first one is the manual annotation of some clusters.
The second one proposes an automatic cluster an-
notation and assumes that we have some NEs that
are already annotated.
Manual annotation of clusters This method is
fastidious but it is the best way to match the cor-
pus data with a specific guidelines for annotating
NEs. It also allows to identify new types of an-
notation. We used the ACE2007 guidelines for
manually annotating each cluster. However, our
CBC system leads to a high number of clusters of
cliques and we cant annotate each of them. For-
tunately, it also leads to a distribution of the clus-
ters size (number of cliques by cluster) which is

\x0csimilar to a Zipf distribution. Consequently, in our
experiments, if we annotate the 100 biggest clus-
ters, we annotate around eighty percent of the de-
tected NEs (see 3).
Automatic annotation of clusters We suppose
in this context that many NEs in NE are already
annotated. Thus, under this assumption, we have
in each cluster provided by the CBC system, both
annotated and non-annotated NEs. Our goal is to
exploit the available annotations for refining the
annotation of a cluster by implicitly taking into
account the syntactic contexts and for propagating
the available annotations to NEs which have no
annotation.
Given a cluster clul of cliques, #(clul, ei) is the
weight of the NE ei in this cluster: it is the number
of cliques in clul that contain ei. For all annota-
tions ap in the set of all possible annotations AN,
we compute its associated score in cluster clul: it
is the sum of the weights of NEs in clul that is
annotated ap.
Then, if the maximal annotation score is greater
than a simple majority (half) of the total votes7, we
assign the corresponding annotation to the clus-
ter. We precise that the annotation &amp;lt;none&amp;gt;8 is
processed in the same way as any other annota-
tions. Thus, a cluster can be globally annotated
&amp;lt;none&amp;gt;. The limit of this automatic approach is
that it doesnt allow to annotate new NE types than
the ones already available.
In the following, we will denote by Aclu(clul)
the annotation of the cluster clul.
The cluster annotation matrix Aclu associated
to the contextual cluster assignment matrix Actxt
and the default cluster assignment matrix Adef in-
troduced previously will be called the CBC sys-
tems NE resource (or shortly the NE resource).
2.6 NEs annotation processes using the NE
resource
In this paragraph, we describe how, given the CBC
systems NE resource, we annotate occurrences of
NEs in the studied corpus with respect to its local
context. We precise that for an occurrence of a NE
ei its associated local context is the set of syntac-
tical dependencies cj in which ei is involved.

2.6.1 NEs annotation process for the CBC
system
Given a NE occurrence and its local context we
can use Actxt(ei, cj) and Adef (ei) in order to get
the default annotation Aclu(Adef (ei)) and the list
of contextual annotations {Aclu(Actxt(ei, cj))}j.
Then for annotating this NE occurrence using
our NE resource, we apply the following rules:
if the list of contextual annotations
{Aclu(Actxt(ei, cj))}j is conflictual, we
annotate the NE occurrence as &amp;lt;none&amp;gt;,
if the list of contextual annotations is non-
conflictual, then we use the corresponding an-
notation to annotate the NE occurrence
if the list of contextual annotations is empty,
we use the default annotation Aclu(Adef (ei)).
The NE resource plus the annotation process de-
scribed in this paragraph lead to a NER system
based on the CBC system. This NER system will
be called CBC-NER system and it will be tested in
our experiments both alone and as a complemen-
tary resource.
2.6.2 NEs annotation process for an hybrid
system
We place ourselves into an hybrid situation where
we have two NER systems (NER 1 + NER 2)
which provide two different lists of annotated
NEs. We want to combine these two systems when
annotating NEs occurrences.
Therefore, we resolve any conflicts by applying
the following rules:
If the same NE occurrence has two different an-
notations from the two systems then there are
two cases. If one of the two system is CBC-
NER system then we take its annotation; oth-
erwise we take the annotation provided by the
NER system which gave the best precision.
If a NE occurrence is included in another one
we only keep the biggest one and its annota-
tion. For example, if Jacques Chirac is anno-
tated &amp;lt;person&amp;gt; by one system and Chirac by
&amp;lt;person&amp;gt; by the other system, then we only
keep the first annotation.
If two NE occurrences are contiguous and have
the same annotation, we merge the two NEs in
one NE occurrence.

\x0cperiments will deal with a corpus of recent news
articles (see (Shinyama and Sekine, 2004) for
motivations regarding our corpus choice) rather
than well-known annotated corpora. Our corpus
is constituted of news in English published on
the web during two weeks in June 2008. This
corpus is constituted of around 300,000 words
(10Mb) which doesnt represent a very large cor-
pus. These texts were taken from various press
sources and they involve different themes (sports,
technology, ...). We extracted randomly a sub-
set of articles and manually annotated 916 NEs (in
our experiments, we deal with three types of an-
notation namely &amp;lt;person&amp;gt;, &amp;lt;organization&amp;gt; and
&amp;lt;location&amp;gt;). This subset constitutes our test set.
In our experiments, first, we applied the XIP
parser (At et al., 2002) to the whole corpus in or-
der to construct the frequency matrix D given by
(1). Next, we computed the similarity matrix be-
tween NEs according to (2) in order to obtain s de-
fined by (4). Using the latter, we computed cliques
of NEs that allow us to obtain the assignment ma-
trix T given by (5). Then we applied the clustering
heuristic described in Algorithm 1. At this stage,
we want to build the NE resource using the clus-
ters of cliques. Therefore, as described in 2.5,
we applied two kinds of clusters annotations: the
manual and the automatic processes. For the first
one, we manually annotated the 100 biggest clus-
ters of cliques. For the second one, we exploited
the annotations provided by XIP NER (Brun and
Hagege, 2004) and we propagated these annota-
tions to the different clusters (see 2.5.2).
The different materials that we obtained consti-
tute the CBC systems NE resource. Our aim now
is to exploit this resource and to show that it allows
to improve the performances of different classic
NER systems.
The different NER systems that we tested are
the following ones:
CBC-NER system M (in short CBC M) based
on the CBC systems NE resource using the
manual cluster annotation (line 1 in Table 1),
CBC-NER system A (in short CBC A) based
on the CBC systems NE resource using the au-
tomatic cluster annotation (line 1 in Table 1),
XIP NER or in short XIP (Brun and Hagege,

the combination of pairs taken among the set
of the three last-mentioned NER systems (lines

hybrid systems use the annotation combination
process described in 2.6.1.
In Table 1 we first reported in each line, the re-
sults given by each system when they are applied
alone (figures in italics). These performances rep-
resent our baselines. Second, we tested for each
baseline system, an extended hybrid system that
integrates the CBC-NER systems (with respect to
the combination process detailed in 2.6.2).
The first two lines of Table 1 show that the
two CBC-NER systems alone lead to rather poor
results. However, our aim is to show that the
CBC-NER system is, despite its low performances
alone, complementary to other basic NER sys-
tems. In other words, we want to show that the
exploitation of the CBC systems NE resource is
beneficial and non-redundant compared to other
baseline NER systems.

in terms of precision9 or recall. For each line, we
put in bold the best performance according to the
F-measure.
These results allow us to show that the NE re-
source built using the CBC system is complemen-
tary to any baseline NER systems and that it al-
lows to improve the results of the latter.
In order to illustrate why the CBC-NER systems
are beneficial, we give below some examples taken
from the test corpus for which the CBC system A

spectively disambiguating or correcting a wrong

Many previous works exist in NEs recognition and
classification. However, most of them do not build
a NEs resource but exploit external gazetteers
(Bunescu and Pasca, 2006), (Cucerzan, 2007).
A recent overview of the field is given in
(Nadeau and Sekine, 2007). According to this pa-
per, we can classify our method in the category
of semi-supervised approaches. Our proposal is
close to (Cucchiarelli and Velardi, 2001) as it uses
syntactic relations (2.2) and as it relies on exist-
ing NER systems (2.6.2). However, the partic-
ularity of our method concerns the clustering of

cliques of NEs that allows both to represent the
different annotations of the NEs and to group the
latter with respect to one precise annotation ac-
cording to a local context.
Regarding this aspect, (Lin and Pantel, 2001)
and (Ngomo, 2008) also use a clique computa-
tion step and a clique merging method. However,
they do not deal with ambiguity of lexical units
nor with NEs. This means that, in their system, a
lexical unit can be in only one merged clique.
From a methodological point of view, our pro-
posal is also close to (Ehrmann and Jacquet, 2007)
as the latter proposes a system for NEs fine-
grained annotation, which is also corpus depen-
dent. However, in the present paper we use all
syntactic relations for measuring the similarity be-
tween NEs whereas in the previous mentioned
work, only specific syntactic relations were ex-
ploited. Moreover, we use clustering techniques
for dealing with the issue related to over produc-
tion of cliques.
In this paper, we construct a NE resource from
the corpus that we want to analyze. In that con-
text, (Pasca, 2004) presents a lightly supervised
method for acquiring NEs in arbitrary categories
from unstructured text of Web documents. How-
ever, Pasca wants to improve web search whereas
we aim at annotating specific NEs of an ana-
lyzed corpus. Besides, as we want to focus on
corpus-specific NEs, our work is also related to
(Shinyama and Sekine, 2004). In this work, the
authors found a significant correlation between the
similarity of the time series distribution of a word
and the likelihood of being a NE. This result mo-
tivated our choice to test our approach on recent
news articles rather than on well-known annotated
corpora.

We propose a system that allows to improve NE
recognition. The core of this system is a clique-
based clustering method based upon a distribu-
tional approach. It allows to extract, analyze and
discover highly relevant information for corpus-
specific NEs annotation. As we have shown in our
experiments, this system combined with another
one can lead to strong improvements. Other appli-
cations are currently addressed in our team using
this approach. For example, we intend to use the
concept of clique-based clustering as a soft clus-

The list of potential NEs extracted from the corpus will be denoted NE and the number of NEs |NE|. 2.2 Distributional space of NEs The distributional approach aims at evaluating a distance between words based on their syntactic distribution. This method assumes that words which appear in the same contexts are semantically similar (Harris, 1951). To construct the distributional space associated to a corpus, we use a robust parser (in our experiments, we used XIP parser (At et al., 2002)) to extract chunks (i.e. nouns, noun phrases, ...) and syntactic dependencies between these chunks. Given this parsers output, we identify triple instances. Each triple has the form w1.R.w2 where w1 and w2 are chunks and R is a syntactic relation (Lin, 1998), (Kilgarriff et al., 2004). One triple gives two contexts (1.w1.R and 2.w2.R) and two chunks (w1 and w2). Then, we only select chunks w which belong to NE. Each point in the distributional space is a NE and each dimension is a syntactic context. CT denotes the set of all syntactic contexts and |CT |represents its cardinal. We illustrate t</context>

The clusters of cliques which contain a NE allow to find the different possible annotations of this NE. This clustering technique must be able to construct pure clusters in order to have precise annotations. In that case, it is desirable to avoid fixing the number of clusters. Thats the reason why we propose to use the Relational Analysis approach described below. 2.4.1 The Relational Analysis approach We propose to apply the Relational Analysis approach (RA) which is a clustering model that doesnt require to fix the number of clusters (Michaud and Marcotorchino, 1980), (Bedecarrax and Warnesson, 1989). This approach takes as input a similarity matrix. In our context, since we want to cluster cliques of NEs, the corresponding similarity matrix S between cliques is given by the dot products matrix taken from T: S = T T0. The general term of this similarity matrix is: S(clik, clik0 ) = Skk0 = hclik, clik0 i. Then, we want to maximize the following clustering function: (S, X) = (6) |CLI| X k,k0=1 Skk0 P (k00,k000)S+ Sk00k000 |S+| ! |{z } contkk0 Xkk0 where S+ = {(clik, clik0 ) : Skk0 &amp;gt; 0}. In other words, clik and clik0 have more chances to be in the same cluster providing that their similarit</context>

This combination leads to a soft-clustering approach that we denote CBC system. The following paragraphs, from 2.1 to 2.6, describe the respective steps mentioned in Figure 1. 2.1 Detection of potential Named Entities Different methods exist for detecting potential NEs. In our system, we used some lexicosyntactic constraints to extract expressions from a corpus because it allows to detect some corpusspecific NEs. In our approach, a potential NE is a noun starting with an upper-case letter or a noun phrase which is (see (Ehrmann and Jacquet, 2007) for similar use): a governor argument of an attribute syntactic relation with a noun as governee argument (e.g. president attribute George Bush) a governee argument of a modifier syntactic relation with a noun as a governor argument (e.g. company modifier Coca-Cola). The list of potential NEs extracted from the corpus will be denoted NE and the number of NEs |NE|. 2.2 Distributional space of NEs The distributional approach aims at evaluating a distance between words based on their syntactic distribution. This method assumes that words which appear in the same contexts are semantically similar</context>
<context position="8506" citStr="Ehrmann and Jacquet, 2007" startWordPosition="1411" endWordPosition="1414">e adjacent nodes which is equivalent to a complete subgraph. A maximal clique is a clique that is not a subset of any other clique. Maximal cliques computation was already employed for semantic space representation (Ploux and Victorri, 1998). In this work, cliques of lexical units are used to represent a precise meaning. Similarly, we compute cliques of NEs in order to represent a precise annotation. For example, Oxford is an ambiguous NE but a clique such as &amp;lt;Cambridge, Oxford, Edinburgh University, Edinburgh, Oxford University&amp;gt; allows to focus on the specific annotation &amp;lt;organization&amp;gt; (see (Ehrmann and Jacquet, 2007) for similar use). Given the distributional space described in the previous paragraph, we use a probabilistic framework for computing similarities between NEs. The approach that we propose is inspired from the language modeling framework introduced in the information retrieval field (see for example (Lavrenko and Croft, 2003)). Then, we construct cliques of NEs based on these similarities. 2.3.1 Similarity measures between NEs We first compute the maximum likelihood estimation for a NE ei to be associated with a context cj: Pml(cj|ei) = D(ei,cj) |ei |, where |ei |= P|CT| j=1 D(ei, cj) is the t</context>

Regarding this aspect, (Lin and Pantel, 2001) and (Ngomo, 2008) also use a clique computation step and a clique merging method. However, they do not deal with ambiguity of lexical units nor with NEs. This means that, in their system, a lexical unit can be in only one merged clique. From a methodological point of view, our proposal is also close to (Ehrmann and Jacquet, 2007) as the latter proposes a system for NEs finegrained annotation, which is also corpus dependent. However, in the present paper we use all syntactic relations for measuring the similarity between NEs whereas in the previous mentioned work, only specific syntactic relations were exploited. Moreover, we use clustering techniques for dealing with the issue related to over production of cliques. In this paper, we construct a NE resource from the corpus that we want to analyze. In that context, (Pasca, 2004) presents a lightly supervised method for acquiring NEs in arbitrary categories from unstruct</context>

To construct the distributional space associated to a corpus, we use a robust parser (in our experiments, we used XIP parser (At et al., 2002)) to extract chunks (i.e. nouns, noun phrases, ...) and syntactic dependencies between these chunks. Given this parsers output, we identify triple instances. Each triple has the form w1.R.w2 where w1 and w2 are chunks and R is a syntactic relation (Lin, 1998), (Kilgarriff et al., 2004).

But unlike this last approach which is based upon euclidean distances and inertial criteria, the RA heuristic aims at maximizing the criterion given in (6).

Given this parsers output, we identify triple instances. Each triple has the form w1.R.w2 where w1 and w2 are chunks and R is a syntactic relation (Lin, 1998), (Kilgarriff et al., 2004). One triple gives two contexts (1.w1.R and 2.w2.R) and two chunks (w1 and w2). Then, we only select chunks w which belong to NE. Each point in the distributional space is a NE and each dimension is a syntactic context. CT denotes the set of all syntactic contexts and |CT |represents its cardinal. We illustrate this construction on the sentence provide Albania with food aid. We obtain the three following triples (note that aid and food aid are considered as two different chunks): provide VERBI-OBJAlbania NOUN provide VERBPREP WITHaid NOUN provide VERBPREP WITHfood ai</context>

However, this problem is NP-hard. As a result, in practice, we use heuristics for dealing with large data sets. 2.4.2 The Relational Analysis heuristic The presented heuristic is quite similar to another algorithm described in (Hartigan, 1975) known as the leader algorithm. But unlike this last approach which is based upon euclidean distances and inertial criteria, the RA heuristic aims at maximizing the criterion given in (6). A sketch of this heuristic is given in Algorithm 1, (see (Marcotorchino and Michaud, 1981) for further details).

The clusters of cliques which contain a NE allow to find the different possible annotations of this NE. This clustering technique must be able to construct pure clusters in order to have precise annotations. In that case, it is desirable to avoid fixing the number of clusters. Thats the reason why we propose to use the Relational Analysis approach described below. 2.4.1 The Relational Analysis approach We propose to apply the Relational Analysis approach (RA) which is a clustering model that doesnt require to fix the number of clusters (Michaud and Marcotorchino, 1980), (Bedecarrax and Warnesson, 1989). This approach takes as input a similarity matrix. In our context, since we want to cluster cliques of NEs, the corresponding similarity matrix S between cliques is given by the dot products matrix taken from T: S = T T0. The general term of this similarity matrix is: S(clik, clik0 ) = Skk0 = hclik, clik0 i. Then, we want to maximize the following clustering function: (S, X) = (6) |CLI| X k,k0=1 Skk0 P (k00,k000)S+ Sk00k000 |S+| ! |{z } contkk0 Xkk0 where S+ = {(clik, clik0 ) : Skk0 &amp;gt; 0}.

In other words, clu is the cluster containing the biggest clique clik containing ei. 2.5.2 Clusters annotation So far, the different steps that we have introduced were unsupervised. In this paragraph, our aim is to give a correct annotation to each cluster (hence, to all NEs in this cluster). To this end, we need some annotation seeds and we propose two different semi-supervised approaches (regarding the classification given in (Nadeau and Sekine, 2007)). The first one is the manual annotation of some clusters. The second one proposes an automatic cluster annotation and assumes that we have some NEs that are already annotated. Manual annotation of clusters This method is fastidious but it is the best way to match the corpus data with a specific guidelines for annotating NEs. It also allows to identify new types of annotation. We used the ACE2007 guidelines for manually annotating each cluster. However, our CBC system leads to a high number of clusters of cliques and we cant annotate each of them. Fortunately, it also leads to a distribution </context>

According to this paper, we can classify our method in the category of semi-supervised approaches.

A maximal clique is a clique that is not a subset of any other clique. Maximal cliques computation was already employed for semantic space representation (Ploux and Victorri, 1998). In this work, cliques of lexical units are used to represent a precise meaning. Similarly, we compute cliques of NEs in order to represent a precise annotation. For example, Oxford is an ambiguous NE but a clique such as &amp;lt;Cambridge, Oxford, Edinburgh University, Edinburgh, Oxford University&amp;gt; allows to focus on the specific annotation &amp;lt;organization&amp;gt; (see (Ehrmann and Jacquet, 2007) for similar use).

For example, if Jacques Chirac is annotated &amp;lt;person&amp;gt; by one system and Chirac by &amp;lt;person&amp;gt; by the other system, then we only keep the first annotation. If two NE occurrences are contiguous and have the same annotation, we merge the two NEs in one NE occurrence. 3 Experiments The system described in this paper rather target corpus-specific NE annotation. Therefore, our ex56 \x0cperiments will deal with a corpus of recent news articles (see (Shinyama and Sekine, 2004) for motivations regarding our corpus choice) rather than well-known annotated corpora. Our corpus is constituted of news in English published on the web during two weeks in June 2008. This corpus is constituted of around 300,000 words (10Mb) which doesnt represent a very large corpus. These texts were taken from various press sources and they involve different themes (sports, technology, ...). We extracted randomly a subset of articles and manually annotated 916 NEs (in our experiments, we deal with three types of annotation namely &amp;lt;person&amp;gt;, &amp;lt;organization&amp;gt; and &amp;lt;location&amp;gt;).
