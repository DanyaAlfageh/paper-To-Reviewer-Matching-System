It is usually modeled as a sequence model, often in combination with part-of-speech tagging and lemmatization (CITATION; CITATION; CITATION; Chrupaa et al., 2008, and others),,
For German, we show results for RFTagger CITATION,,
For Czech, we use the morphological analyzer distributed with the Prague Dependency Treebank 2 CITATION,,
For Hungarian, we use CITATION, and for Spanish, we use the morphological analyzer included in Freeling CITATION,,
the gender of nouns, which often cannot be deduced from the word form CITATION.7 We extend our system from the previous experiment to include information from a morphological dictionaries,,
CITATION, CITATION, CITATION),,
For Hebrew, this problem has also been addressed by jointly modeling segmentation, morphological prediction, and syntax (CITATION; CITATION; CITATION),,
A promising avenue may be the approach by CITATION,,
CITATION or CITATION,,
We use the brute-force algorithm described in CITATION, which selects for each token in the sentence another token as the head,,
For all matters of syntactic annotation in this paper, we use the graph-based dependency parser by CITATION, also included in mate-tools,,
Modeling morphosyntactic relations explicitly has been shown to improve statistical parsing models (CITATION; CITATION; CITATION), but the codependency between morphology and syntax makes it a difficult problem, and linguistic intuition is often contradicted by the empirical findings,,
g., CITATION, CITATION) suggests many interactions between morphology and syntax,,
The most common approach is the combination of a morphological lexicon with a statistical disambiguation model (CITATION; CITATION; CITATION; CITATION; CITATION),,
For Czech, we also show results from featurama8 with the feature set developed by CITATION,,
Figure 1 shows a German noun phrase taken from the German TiGer corpus CITATION,,
The last-verb/next-verb and pos+case features are variants of the features proposed in CITATION,,
CITATION),,
Morphological features co-vary between two items in the sentence, but the relation between these items can occur at various linguistic levels CITATION,,
Our work has been inspired by CITATION, who annotate a treebank with morphological information after the syntax had been annotated already,,
CITATION pursue the idea of jointly predicting syntax and morphology, out of the motivation that joint models should model the problem more faithfully,,
For German, we use DMor CITATION,,
the gender of nouns, which often cannot be deduced from the word form CITATION.7 We extend our system from the previous experiment to include information from ,,
Models are trained using passiveaggressive online training CITATION,,
In many languages, two words that participate in a syntactic relation show covariance in some or all of their morphological features (so-called agreement, CITATION).3 Automatic annotation of morphology assigns morphological descriptions (e,,
the gender of nouns, which often cannot be deduced from the word form CITATION.7 We extend our system from the previous experiment to include information from a morphological dictionarie,,
For Hungarian, we use the Szeged Dependency Treebank CITATION, with the split of CITATION,,
For example, languages with a case system use different forms of the same word to mark different syntactic (or semantic) relations CITATION,,
For German, we use the dependency conversion of the TiGer treebank by CITATION, splitting it into 40k/5k/5k sentences for training/development/test,,
For example, CITATION show that case information is the most helpful morphological feature for parsing Arabic, but only if it is given as gold information, whereas using case information from an automatic system may even harm the performance,,
