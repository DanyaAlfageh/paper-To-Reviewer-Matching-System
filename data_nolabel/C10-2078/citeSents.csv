ich we extract in the next section, all instances in our data sets were part-of-speech tagged by the MXPOST tagger CITATION, parsed with the MaltParser2, and named entity tagged with the Stanford NE tagger CITATION,,
The lemmatization was done by RASP CITATION,,
This approach was later extended by CITATION, who take a larger context into account when computing the feature vectors (e.g., the whole paragraph) and who also include prepositions and determiners in addition to content words,,
CITATION present a rule-based system in which lexico-syntactic features of different idioms are hard-coded in a lexicon and then used to distinguish literal and non-literal usages,,
CITATION compute meaning vectors for literal and non-literal examples in the training set and then classify test instances based on the closeness of their meaning vectors to those of the ,,
CITATION present a supervised approach to token-based idiom distinction for Japanese, in which they implement several features, such as features known from other word sense disambiguation t,,
CITATION propose another unsupervised method which detects the presence or absence of cohesive links between the component words of the idiom and the surrounding discourse,,
pically occurs in its canonical form CITATION,,
It has been observed that if an expression is used idiomatically, it typically occurs in its canonical form CITATION,,
3 Data We used the data set created by CITATION, which consists of 13 English expressions (mainly V+PP or V+NP) that can be used both literally and idiomatically, such as break the ice o,,
To compute the features which we extract in the next section, all instances in our data sets were part-of-speech tagged by the MXPOST tagger CITATION, parsed with the MaltParser2, and named entity tagged with the Stanford NE tagger CITATION,,
3 Data We used the data set created by CITATION, which consists of 13 English expressions (mainly V+PP or V+NP) that can be used both literally an,,
CITATION and CITATION take a different approach, which crucially relies on the concept of canonical form (CForm),,
Hence, idiomatic expressions are not only a problem for semantic analysis but can also have a negative effect on other NLP applications CITATION, such as parsing CITATION,,
CITATION model literal vs,,
CITATION later extended this work by combining the unsupervised classifier with a secondstage supervised classifier,,
In addition, we also included the prediction of the cohesion graph proposed by CITATION as an additional feature,,
It is assumed that for each idiom there is a fixed form (or a small set of those) corresponding to the syntactic pattern(s) in which the idiom normally occurs CITATION.The canonical form allows for inflectional variation of the head verb but not for other variations (such,,
Finally, CITATION also experimented with a supervised classifier, which takes into account various surface features,,
4.3 Discourse Cohesion (dc) We implemented two features, related score and discourse connectivity, which take into account the cohesive structure of an expression in its context as described by CITATION,,
CITATION later extended this work by combining t,,
We used the Stanford NE tagger CITATION, and encoded three named entity classes (person, location, organiszation) in the feature vector,,
We implemented two sets of features which encode the global lexical context: salient words and related words as described in CITATION,,
Among the earliest studies on token-based classification were the ones by CITATION on Japanese and CITATION on German,,
The few previous studies have mainly looked at the lexical context in which and expression occurs (CITATION; CITATION),,
n which the idiom normally occurs CITATION.The canonical form allows for inflectional variation of the head verb but not for other variations (such as nominal inflection, choice of determiner etc.),,
CITATION compute meaning vectors for literal and non-literal examples in the training set and then classify test instances based on the closeness of their meaning vectors to those of the training examples,,
CITATION present a supervised approach to token-based idiom distinction for Japanese, in which they implement several features, such as features known from other word sense disambiguation tasks (e.g., collocations) and idiom-specific features taken from CITATION,,
It is assumed that for each idiom there is a fixed form (or a small set of those) corresponding to the syntactic pattern(s) in which the idiom normally occurs CITATION.The canonical form allows for inflectional variation of the head verb but not for other variations (such as nominal inflection, choice of determiner etc.),,
