CITATION used a bootstrapping approach to align the information networks from bilingual comparable corpora, and discover name translations and extract relations links simultaneously,,
The underlying hypothesis of cross-document inference is that the salience of a fact should be calculated by taking into consideration both its confidence and the confidence of other facts connected to it, which is inspired by PageRank CITATION and LexRank CITATION,,
Appriou et al., 2001; CITATION) mostly focus on resolving conflicts rather than identifying them (i.e,,
Some prior work (CITATION; CITATION) demonstrated,,
