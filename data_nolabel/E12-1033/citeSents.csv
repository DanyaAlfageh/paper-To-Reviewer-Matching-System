 supervised classifier most frequently used for information extraction tasks, in general, are conditional random fields (CRF) CITATION,,
High-level information as it is encoded in a rule-based classifier generalizes better than learning-based methods (CITATION; Lambov,,
While on the evaluation on the entire MPQA corpus, opinion holders in patient position are fairly rare (CITATIONb), we may wonder whether the same applies to the individual domains that we consider in this,,
We take the best configuration from CITATION that comprises a combination of three different tree kernels being two tree kernels based on constituency parse trees (one with predicate and another with semantic scope) and a tree kernel encoding predicate-argument structures based on semantic role information,,
We evaluate the sequential output with precision, recall and F-score as defined in (CITATION; CITATION),,
holder:patient We follow CITATIONb) who found that those predicates can be best obtained by using a subset of Levins verb classes CITATION and the strong subjective expressions of the Subjectivity Lexicon CITATION,,
This is no surprise as the SPACEdomain is more similar to the source domain than 14 The reason for RB having a high recall is extensively discussed in (CITATIONb),,
In order to divide it into different domains, we use the topic labels from CITATION,,
CITATIONa) present an intermediate solution for opinion holder extraction inspired by distant supervision CITATION,,
High-level information as it is encoded in a rule-based classifier generalizes better than learning-based methods (CITATION; CITATION),,
We induced 1000 clusters which is also the configuration used in CITATION.5 Table 2 illustrates a few of the clusters induced from our unlabeled dataset introduced in Section () 2,,
4.1 Conditional Random Fields (CRF) The supervised classifier most frequently used for information extraction tasks, in general, are conditional random fields (CRF) CITATION,,
CITATIONa) show that considering less restrictive contexts significantly drops classification performance,,
Existing text collections containing product reviews (CITATION; CITATION), which are generally a popular resource for sentiment analysis, were not found suitable as they only contain few distinct opinion holders,,
We adhere to the definition of opinion holders from previous work (CITATION; CITATIONa; CITATIONb), i.e,,
As a stateof-the-art clustering method, we consider Brown clustering CITATION as implemented in the SRILM-toolkit CITATION,,
1 By agent we always mean constituents being labeled as A0 in PropBank CITATION,,
2 Data As a labeled dataset we mainly use the MPQA 2.0 corpus CITATION,,
discussed in (CITATIONb),,
We believe that this relaxation can be done in that particular case, as adjectives are much more likely to convey opinions a priori than verbs CITATION,,
CITATION found the 5 We also experimented with other sizes but they did not produce a better overall performance,,
12 disi.unitn.it/moschitti 13 The cost parameter j CITATION was set to 5,,
The features we use (Table 5) are mostly inspired by CITATION and by the ones used for plain support vector machines (SVMs) in CITATION,,
every source of a private state or a subjective speech event CITATION is considered an opinion holder,,
CITATIONb) found that many of those latter predicates are listed in one of Levins verb classes called amuse,,
The extraction of sources of opinions is an essential component for complex real-life applications, such as opinion question answering systems or opinion summarization systems CITATION,,
ETHICS).8 For semantic role labeling we use SWIRL9, for chunk parsing CASS (Abney, 1991) and for constituency parsing Stanford Parser CITATION,,
It is mostly used in SVMs that estimate a hyperplane to separate data instances from different classes H(~ x) = ~ w ~ x + b = 0 where w Rn and b R CITATION,,
CITATIONb) found that many of those latter predicates are listed in one of Levins verb classes called amuse verbs,,
We re-use the framework by CITATIONb),,
