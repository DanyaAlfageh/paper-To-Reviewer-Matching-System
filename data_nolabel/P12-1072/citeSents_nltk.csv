The political blogs corpus is a collection of blog posts about politics in the United States CITATION, and the sports news corpus contains news summaries of major league sports games (National Basketball 3 On our moderate-sized datasets (see 4.1), each iteration takes approximately three minutes on a 2.2GHz CPU.,,
The input is a collection of mentions found by a named entity recognizer, along with their contexts, and, following CITATION, the output is a table in which entities are rows (the number of which is not pre-specified) and attribute words are organized into columns.,,
This paper contributes a model that builds on the approach of CITATION, but also: incorporates context of the mention to help with disambiguation and to allow mentions that do not share words to be merged liberally; conditions against shape features, which improve the assignment of words to columns; is designed to explicitly handle some noise; and is learned using elements of Bayesian inference with conditional estimation (see 2).,,
Our approach is based on a probabilistic graphical model that generates the mentions, which are observed, and the table, which is mostly unobserved, similar to CITATION.,,

For the politics dataset, we follow CITATION and use the string edit distance between mention strings in each cluster to define the score.,,
As a strong baseline, we also compare our approach with the original implementation of the model of CITATION, denoted by EEA.,,
