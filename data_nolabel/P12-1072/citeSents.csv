Our model is focused on the problem of canonicalizing mention strings into their parts, though its r variables (which map mentions to rows) could be interpreted as (within-document and cross-document) coreference resolution, which has been tackled using a range of probabilistic models (CITATION; CITATION; Poon ,,
This kind of blocked Gibbs sampling was proposed by CITATION and used in NLP by CITATION,,
As a strong baseline, we also compare our approach with the original implementation of the model of CITATION, denoted by EEA,,
Our overall learning procedure is a Monte Carlo Expectation Maximization algorithm CITATION,,
Our approach is based on a probabilistic graphical model that generates the mentions, which are observed, and the table, which is mostly unobserved, similar to CITATION,,
The input is a collection of mentions found by a named entity recognizer, along with their contexts, and, following CITATION, the output is a table in which entities are rows (the number of which is not pre-specified) and attribute words are organized into columns,,
The optimization of can be described as empirical Bayesian estimation CITATION in which the parameters of a prior are fit to data,,
The political blogs corpus is a collection of blog posts about politics in the United States CITATION, and the sports news corpus contains news summaries of major league sports games (National Basketball 3 On our moderate-sized datasets (see 4.1), each iteration takes approximately three minutes on a 2.2GHz CPU,,
5 Related Work There has been work that attempts to fill predefined templates using Bayesian nonparametrics CITATION and automatically learns template structures using agglomerative clustering CITATION,,
Our model is focused on the problem of canonicalizing mention strings into their parts, though its r variables (which map mentions to rows) could be interpreted as (within-document and cross-document) coreference resolution, which has been tackled using a range of probabilistic models (CITATION; CITATION; CITATION; CITATION),,
This paper contributes a model that builds on the approach of CITATION, but also: incorporates context of the mention to help with disambiguation and to allow mentions that do not share words to be merged liberally; conditions against shape features, which improve the assignment of words to columns; is designed to explicitly handle some noise; and is learned using elements of Bayesian inference with conditional estimation (see 2),,
3.1.2 Sampling Columns Our column sampling procedure is novel to this work and substantially differs from that of CITATION,,
CITATION and CITATION focused specifically on names and discovering their structure, which is a part of the problem we consider here,,
4 Experiments We compare several variations of our model to CITATION (the authors provided their implementation to us) and a clustering baseline,,
For the politics dataset, we follow CITATION and use the string edit distance between mention strings in each cluster to define the score,,
The optimization of can be described as contrastive estimation CITATION, in which some aspects of the data are conditioned against for computational convenience,,
3.2 M-step In the M-step, we use gradient-based optimization routines, L-BFGS CITATION and OWL-QN CITATION respectively, to maximize with respect to and ,,
The first step in evaluation is to find a maximum score bipartite matching between rows in the response and reference table.5 Given the response and 5 Treating each row as a set of words, we can optimize the matching using the CITATION algorithm,,
re similar to our work, CITATION introduced a nonparametric Bayesian approach to extract structured databases of entities,,
Due to the large size of the corpora, we uniformly sampled a subset of documents for each corpus and ran the Stanford NER tagger CITATION, which tagged named entities mentions as person, location, and organization,,
3.1.1 Sampling Rows Similar to CITATION, when we sample the row for a mention, we use Bayes rule and marginalize the columns,,
rning procedure is a Monte Carlo Expectation Maximization algorithm CITATION,,

We expect column-feature weights to be mostly zero, so a sparsity-inducing Laplace prior is used CITATION,,
