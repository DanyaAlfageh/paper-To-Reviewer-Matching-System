Abstract

<bodyText confidence="0.993617148148148">
Linguistically annotated corpus based
on texts in biomedical domain has been
constructed to tune natural language
processing (NLP) tools for bio-
textmining. As the focus of information
extraction is shifting from &quot;nominal&quot;
information such as named entity to
&quot;verbal&quot; information such as function
and interaction of substances, applica-
tion of parsers has become one of the
key technologies and thus the corpus
annotated for syntactic structure of sen-
tences is in demand. A subset of the
GENIA corpus consisting of 500
MEDLINE abstracts has been anno-
tated for syntactic structure in an XML-
based format based on Penn Treebank
II (PTB) scheme. Inter-annotator
agreement test indicated that the writ-
ing style rather than the contents of the
research abstracts is the source of the
difficulty in tree annotation, and that
annotation can be stably done by lin-
guists without much knowledge of bi-
ology with appropriate guidelines
regarding to linguistic phenomena par-
ticular to scientific texts.

1 Introduction
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.99964397826087">
Research and development for information ex-
traction from biomedical literature (bio-
textmining) has been rapidly advancing due to
demands caused by information overload in the
genome-related field. Natural language process-
ing (NLP) techniques have been regarded as
useful for this purpose. Now that focus of in-
formation extraction is shifting from extraction
of nominal information such as named entity
to verbal information such as relations of enti-
ties including events and functions, syntactic
analysis is an important issue of NLP applica-
tion in biomedical domain. In extraction of rela-
tion, the roles of entities participating in the
relation must be identified along with the verb
that represents the relation itself. In text analysis,
this corresponds to identifying the subjects, ob-
jects, and other arguments of the verb.
Though rule-based relation information ex-
traction systems using surface pattern matching
and/or shallow parsing can achieve high-
precision (e.g. Koike et al., 2004) in a particular
target domain, they tend to suffer from low re-
call due to the wide variation of the surface ex-
pression that describe a relation between a verb
and its arguments. In addition, the portability of
such systems is low because the system has to
be re-equipped with different set of rules when
different kind of relation is to be extracted. One
solution to this problem is using deep parsers
which can abstract the syntactic variation of a
relation between a verb and its arguments repre-
sented in the text, and constructing extraction
rule on the abstract predicate-argument structure.
To do so, wide-coverage and high-precision
parsers are required.
While basic NLP techniques are relatively
general and portable from domain to domain,
customization and tuning are inevitable, espe-
cially in order to apply the techniques effec-
tively to highly specialized literatures such as
research papers and abstracts. As recent ad-
vances in NLP technology depend on machine-
learning techniques, annotated corpora from
which system can acquire rules (including
grammar rules, lexicon, etc.) are indispensable

\x0cresources for customizing general-purpose NLP
tools. In bio-textmining, for example, training
on part-of-speech (POS)-annotated GENIA cor-
pus was reported to improve the accuracy of
JunK tagger (English POS tagger) (Kazama et
al., 2001) from 83.5% to 98.1% on MEDLINE
abstracts (Tateisi and Tsujii, 2004), and the
FraMed corpus (Wermter and Hahn, 2004) was
used to train TnT tagger on German (Brants,
2000) to improve its accuracy from 95.7% to
98% on clinical reports and other biomedical
texts. Corpus annotated for syntactic structures
is expected to play a similar role in tuning pars-
ers to biomedical domain, i.e., similar improve-
ment on the performance of parsers is expected
by using domain-specific treebank as a resource
for learning. For this purpose, we construct
GENA Treebank (GTB), a treebank on research
abstracts in biomedical domain.

2 Outline of the Corpus
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.99856171875">
The base text of GTB is that of the GENIA cor-
pus constructed at University of Tokyo (Kim et
al., 2003), which is a collection of research ab-
stracts selected from the search results of
MEDLINE database with keywords (MeSH
terms) human, blood cells and transcription fac-
tors. In the GENIA corpus, the abstracts are en-
coded in an XML scheme where each abstract is
numbered with MEDLINE UID and contains
title and abstract. The text of title and abstract is
segmented into sentences in which biological
terms are annotated with their semantic classes.
The GENIA corpus is also annotated for part-of-
speech (POS) (Tateisi and Tsujii, 2004), and
coreference is also annotated in a part of the
GENIA corpus by MedCo project at Institute for
Infocomm Research, Singapore (Yang et al,
2004).
GTB is the addition of syntactic information
to the GENIA corpus. By annotating various
linguistic information on a same set of text, the
GENIA corpus will be a resource not only for
individual purpose such as named entity extrac-
tion or training parsers but also for integrated
systems such as information extraction using
deep linguistic analysis. Similar attempt of con-
structing integrated corpora is being done in
University of Pennsylvania, where a corpus of
MEDLINE abstracts in CYP450 and oncology
domains where annotated for named entities,
POS, and tree structure of sentences (Kulick et
al, 2004).

<subsectionHeader confidence="0.998854">
2.1 Annotation Scheme
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.998337297872341">
The annotation scheme basically follows the
Penn Treebank II (PTB) scheme (Beis et al,
1995), encoded in XML. A non-null constituent
is marked as an element, with its syntactic cate-
gory (which may be combined with its function
tags indicating grammatical roles such as -SBJ,
-PRD, and -ADV) used as tags. A null constitu-
ent is marked as a childless element whose tag
corresponds to its categories. Other function tags
are encoded as attributes. Figure 1 shows an ex-
ample of annotated sentence in XML, and the
corresponding PTB notation. The label S
means sentence, NP noun phrase, PP
prepositional phrase, and VP verb phrase.
The label NP-SBJ means that the element is
an NP that serves as the subject of the sentence.
A null element, the trace of the object of stud-
ied moved by passivization, is denoted by
&amp;lt;NP NULL=&quot;NONE&quot; ref=&quot;i55&quot;/&gt; in XML
and *-55 in PTB notation. The number 55
which refers to the identifier of the moved ele-
ment, is denoted by id and ref attributes in
XML, and is denoted as a part of a label in PTB.
In addition to changing the encoding, we
made some modifications to the scheme. First,
analysis within the noun phrase is simplified.
Second, semantic division of adverbial phrases
such as TMP (time) and MNR (manner)
are not used: adverbial constituents other than
ADVP (adverbial phrases) or PP used ad-
verbially are marked with ADV tags but not
with semantic tags. Third, a coordination struc-
ture is explicitly marked with the attribute
SYN=COOD whereas in the original PTB
scheme it is not marked as such.
In our GTB scheme, NX (head of a com-
plex noun phrase) and NAC (a certain kind of
nominal modifier within a noun phrase) of the
PTB scheme are not used. A noun phrase is gen-
erally left unstructured. This is mainly in order
to simplify the process of annotation. In case of
biomedical abstracts, long noun phrases often
involve multi-word technical terms whose syn-
tactic structure is difficult to determine without
deep domain knowledge. However, the structure
of noun phrases are usually independent of the
structure outside the phrase, so that it would be
</bodyText>
<page confidence="0.98948">
221
</page>
<bodyText confidence="0.998070578947368">
\x0ceasier to analyze the phrases involving such
terms independently (e.g. by biologists) and
later merge the two analysis together. Thus we
have decided that we leave noun phrases un-
structured in GTB annotation unless their analy-
sis is necessary for determining the structure
outside the phrase. One of the exception is the
cases that involves coordination where it is nec-
essary to explicitly mark up the coordinated
constituents.
In addition, we have added special attributes
TXTERR, UNSURE, and COMMENT
for later inspection. The TXTERR is used
when the annotator suspects that there is a
grammatical error in the original text; the
UNSURE attribute is used when the annotator
is not confident; and the COMMENT is used
for free comments (e.g. reason of using
UNSURE) by the annotator.

Although the sentence boundaries were adopted
from the corpus, the tree structure annotation
was done independently of POS- and term- an-
notation already done on the GENIA corpus.
The annotator was a Japanese non-biologist who
has previously involved in the POS annotation
of the GENIA corpus and accustomed to the
style of research abstracts in English. Manually
annotated abstracts are automatically converted
to the PTB format, merged with the POS annota-
tion of the GENIA corpus (version 3.02).

3 Annotation Results
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.985447185185185">
So far, 500 abstracts are annotated and con-
verted to the merged PTB format. In the merg-
ing process, we found several annotation errors.
The 500 abstracts with correction of these errors
are made publicly available as The GENIA
Treebank Beta Version (GTB-beta).
For further clean-up, we also tried to parse
the corpus by the Enju parser (Miyao and Tsujii
2004), and identify the error of the corpus by
investigating into the parse errors. Enju is an
HPSG parser that can be trained with PTB-type
corpora which is reported to have 87% accuracy
on Wall Street Journal portion of Penn Treebank
corpus. Currently the accuracy of the parser
drops down to 82% on GTB-beta, and although
proper quantitative analysis is yet to be done, it
was found that the mismatches between labels of
the treebank and the GENIA POS corpus (e.g.
an ing form labeled as noun in the POS corpus
and as the head of a verb phrase in the tree cor-
pus) are a major source of parse error. The cor-
rection is complicated because several errors in
the GENIA POS corpus were found in this
cleaning-up process. When the cleaning-up
process is done, we will make the corpus pub-
licly available as the proper release.

We have also checked inter-annotator agreement.
Although the PTB scheme is popular among
natural language processing society, applicabil-
ity of the scheme to highly specialized text such
as research abstract is yet to be discussed. Espe-
cially, when the annotation is done by linguists,
lack of domain knowledge might decrease the
stability and accuracy of annotation.

stracts) was annotated by another annotator. The

\x0ctechnical documents in English and in corpus
annotation of English texts.
The two results were examined manually,
and there were 131 disagreements. Almost every
sentence had at least one disagreement. We have
made the gold standard from the two sets of
abstracts by resolving the disagreements, and the
accuracy of the annotators against this gold
standard were 96.7% for the first annotator and
97.4% for the second annotator.
Of the disagreement, the most prominent
were the cases involving coordination, espe-
cially the ones with ellipsis. For example, one
annotator annotated the phrase IL-1- and IL-18-
mediated function as in Figure 2a, the other
annotated as Figure 2b.
Such problem is addressed in the PTB
guideline and both formats are allowed as alter-
natives. As coordination with ellipsis occurs
rather frequently in research abstracts, this kind
of phenomena has higher effect on decrease of
the agreement rate than in Penn Treebank. Of
the 131 disagreements, 25 were on this type of
coordination.
Another source of disagreement is the at-
tachment of modifiers such as prepositional
phrases and pronominal adjectives. However,
most are benign ambiguity where the differ-
ence of the structure does not affect on interpre-
tation, such as high expression of STAT in
monocytes where the prepositional phrase in
monocytes can attach to expression or
STAT without much difference in meaning,
and is augmented when the sensitizing tumor is
a genetically modified variant where the wh-
clause can attach to is augmented or aug-
mented without changing the meaning. The
PTB guideline states that the modifier should be
attached at the higher level in the former case
and at the lower case in the latter. In the annota-
tion results, one annotator consistently attached
the modifiers in both cases at the higher level,
and the other consistently at the lower level, in-
dicating that the problem is in understanding the
scheme rather than understanding the sentence.
Only 15 cases were true ambiguities that needed
knowledge of biology to solve, in which 5 in-
volved coordination (e.g., the scope of various
in various T cell lines and peripheral blood
cells) .
Although the number was small, there were
disagreements on how to annotate a mathemati-
cal formula such as n=2 embedded in the sen-
tence, since mathematical formulae were outside
the scope of the original PTB scheme. One an-
notator annotated this kind of phrase consis-
tently as a phrase with = as an adjective, the
other annotated as phrase with = as a verb.
There were 6 such cases. Another disagreement
particular to abstracts is a treatment of labeled
sentences. There were 8 sentences in two ab-
stracts where there is a label like Background:.
One annotator included the colon (:) in the la-
bel, while the other did not. Yet another is that
one regarded the phrase Author et al as coor-
dination, and the other regarded et al as a
modifier.

5 Discussion
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.99974865625">
The result of the inter-annotator agreement
test indicates that the writing style rather than
the contents of the research abstracts is the
source of the difficulty in tree annotation. Con-
trary to the expectation that the lack of domain
knowledge causes a problem in annotation on
attachments of modifiers, the number of cases
where annotation of modifier attachment needs
domain knowledge is small. This indicates that
linguists can annotate most of syntactic structure
without an expert level of domain knowledge.
A major source of difficulty is coordination,
especially the ones involving ellipsis. Coordina-
tion is reported to be difficult phenomena in an-
notation of different levels in the GENIA corpus
(Tateisi and Tsujii, 2004), (Kim et al., 2003). In
addition to the fact that this is the major source
of inter-annotator agreement, the annotator often
commented the coordinated structure as unsure.
The problem of coordination can be divided into
two with different nature: one is that the annota-
tion policy is still not well-established for the
coordination involving ellipsis, and the other is
an ambiguity when the coordinated phrase has
modifiers.
Syntax annotation of coordination with ellip-
sis is difficult in general but the more so in an-
notation of abstracts than in the case of general
texts, because in abstracts authors tend to pack
information in limited number of words. The
PTB guideline dedicates a long section for this
phenomena and allows alternatives in annotation,
but there are still cases which are not well-
covered by the scheme. For example, in addition
to the disagreement, the phrase illustrated in
Figure 2a and Figure 2b shows another problem
of the annotation scheme. Both annotators fail to
indicate that it is mediated that was to be after
IL-1 because there is no mechanism of
coindexing a null element with a part of a token.
This problem of ellipsis can frequently occur
in research abstracts, and it can be argued that
the tokenization criteria must be changed for
texts in biomedical domain (Yamamoto and Sa-
tou, 2004) so that such fragment as IL-18 and
mediated in IL-18-ediated should be regarede
as separate tokens. The Pennsylvania biology
corpus (Kulick et al., 2004) partially solves this
problem by separating a token where two or
more subtokens are connected with hyphens, but
in the cases where a shared part of the word is
not separated by a hyphen (e.g. metric of ste-
reo- and isometric alleles) the word including
the part is left uncut. The current GTB follows
the GENIA corpus that it retains the tokeniza-
tion criteria of the original Penn Treebank, but
this must be reconsidered in future.
For analysis of coordination with ellipsis, if
the information on full forms is available, one
strategy would be to leave the inside structure of
coordination unannotated in the treebank corpus
(and in the phase of text analysis the structure is
not established in the phase of parsing but with a
different mechanism) and later merge it with the
coordination structure annotation. The GENIA
term corpus annotates the full form of a techni-
cal term whose part is omitted in the surface as
an attribute of the &amp;lt;cons&gt; element indicating a
technical term (Kim et al., 2003). In the above-
mentioned Pennsylvania corpus, a similar
mechanism (chaining) is used for recovering
the full form of named entities. However, in
both corpora, no such information is available
outside the terms/entities.
The cases where scope of modification in
coordinated phrases is problematic are few but
they are more difficult in abstracts than in gen-
eral texts because the resolution of ambiguity
needs domain knowledge. If term/entity annota-
tion is already done, that information can help
resolve this type of ambiguity, but again the
problem is that outside the terms/entities such
information is not available. It would be practi-
cal to have the structure flat but specially
marked when the tree annotators are unsure and
have a domain expert resolve the ambiguity, as
the sentences that needs such intervention seems
few. Some cases of ambiguity in modifier at-
tachment (which do not involve coordination)
can be solved with similar process.
We believe that other type of disagreements
can be solved with supplementing criteria for
linguistic phenomena not well-covered by the
scheme, and annotator training. Automatic pre-
processing by POS taggers and parsers can also
help increase the consistent annotation.

</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999189964285714">
A subset of the GENIA corpus is annotated
for syntactic (tree) structure. Inter-annotator
agreement test indicated that the annotation can
be done stably by linguists without much
knowledge in biology, provided that proper
guideline is established for linguistic phenomena
particular to scientific research abstracts. We
have made the 500-abstract corpus in both XML
and PTB formats and made it publicly available
as the GENIA Treebank beta version (GTB-
beta). We are in further cleaning up process of
the 500-abstract set, and at the same time, initial
annotation of the remaining abstracts is being
done, so that the full GENIA set of 2000 ab-
stracts will be annotated with tree structure.
For parsers to be useful for information ex-
traction, they have to establish a map between
syntactic structure and more semantic predicate-
argument structure, and between the linguistic
predicate-argument structures to the factual rela-
tion to be extracted. Annotation of various in-
formation on a same set of text can help
establish these maps. For the factual relations,
we are annotating relations between proteins and
genes in cooperation with a group of biologists.
For predicate-argument annotation, we are in-
vestigating the use of the parse results of the
Enju parser.

<abstract confidence="0.998499642857143">Linguistically annotated corpus based on texts in biomedical domain has been constructed to tune natural language processing (NLP) tools for biotextmining. As the focus of information extraction is shifting from &quot;nominal&quot; information such as named entity to &quot;verbal&quot; information such as function and interaction of substances, application of parsers has become one of the key technologies and thus the corpus annotated for syntactic structure of sentences is in demand. A subset of the GENIA corpus consisting of 500 MEDLINE abstracts has been annotated for syntactic structure in an XMLbased format based on Penn Treebank II (PTB) scheme. Inter-annotator agreement test indicated that the writing style rather than the contents of the research abstracts is the source of the difficulty in tree annotation, and that annotation can be stably done by linguists without much knowledge of biology with appropriate guidelines regarding to linguistic phenomena particular to scientific texts.</abstract>

Corpus annotated for syntactic structures is expected to play a similar role in tuning parsers to biomedical domain, i.e., similar improvement on the performance of parsers is expected by using domain-specific treebank as a resource for learning. For this purpose, we construct GENA Treebank (GTB), a treebank on research abstracts in biomedical domain. 2 Outline of the Corpus The base text of GTB is that of the GENIA corpus constructed at University of Tokyo (Kim et al., 2003), which is a collection of research abstracts selected from the search results of MEDLINE database with keywords (MeSH terms) human, blood cells and transcription factors. In the GENIA corpus, the abstracts are encoded in an XML scheme where each abstract is numbered with MEDLINE UID and contains title and abstract. The text of title and abstract is segmented into sentences in which biological terms are annotated with their semantic classes. The GENIA corpus is also annotated for part-ofspeech (POS) (Tateisi and Tsujii, 2004), and coreference is also annotated in a part of the GENIA corpus by </context>

Contrary to the expectation that the lack of domain knowledge causes a problem in annotation on attachments of modifiers, the number of cases where annotation of modifier attachment needs domain knowledge is small. This indicates that linguists can annotate most of syntactic structure without an expert level of domain knowledge. A major source of difficulty is coordination, especially the ones involving ellipsis. Coordination is reported to be difficult phenomena in annotation of different levels in the GENIA corpus (Tateisi and Tsujii, 2004), (Kim et al., 2003). In addition to the fact that this is the major source of inter-annotator agreement, the annotator often commented the coordinated structure as unsure. The problem of coordination can be divided into two with different nature: one is that the annotation policy is still not well-established for the coordination involving ellipsis, and the other is an ambiguity when the coordinated phrase has modifiers. Syntax annotation of coordination with ellipsis is difficult in general but the more so in annotation of abstracts than in the case of general texts, because in abstracts authors tend to pack in</context>

For analysis of coordination with ellipsis, if the information on full forms is available, one strategy would be to leave the inside structure of coordination unannotated in the treebank corpus (and in the phase of text analysis the structure is not established in the phase of parsing but with a different mechanism) and later merge it with the coordination structure annotation. The GENIA term corpus annotates the full form of a technical term whose part is omitted in the surface as an attribute of the &amp;lt;cons&gt; element indicating a technical term (Kim et al., 2003). In the abovementioned Pennsylvania corpus, a similar mechanism (chaining) is used for recovering the full form of named entities. However, in both corpora, no such information is available outside the terms/entities. The cases where scope of modification in coordinated phrases is problematic are few but they are more difficult in abstracts than in general texts because the resolution of ambiguity needs domain knowledge. If term/entity annotation is already done, that information can help resolve this type of ambiguity, but again the problem is that outside the terms/entities such information</context>

In extraction of relation, the roles of entities participating in the relation must be identified along with the verb that represents the relation itself. In text analysis, this corresponds to identifying the subjects, objects, and other arguments of the verb. Though rule-based relation information extraction systems using surface pattern matching and/or shallow parsing can achieve highprecision (e.g. Koike et al., 2004) in a particular target domain, they tend to suffer from low recall due to the wide variation of the surface expression that describe a relation between a verb and its arguments. In addition, the portability of such systems is low because the system has to be re-equipped with different set of rules when different kind of relation is to be extracted. One solution to this problem is using deep parsers which can abstract the syntactic variation of a relation between a verb and its arguments represented in the text, and constructing extraction rule on the abstract predicate-argument structure.

By annotating various linguistic information on a same set of text, the GENIA corpus will be a resource not only for individual purpose such as named entity extraction or training parsers but also for integrated systems such as information extraction using deep linguistic analysis. Similar attempt of constructing integrated corpora is being done in University of Pennsylvania, where a corpus of MEDLINE abstracts in CYP450 and oncology domains where annotated for named entities, POS, and tree structure of sentences (Kulick et al, 2004). 2.1 Annotation Scheme The annotation scheme basically follows the Penn Treebank II (PTB) scheme (Beis et al, 1995), encoded in XML. A non-null constituent is marked as an element, with its syntactic category (which may be combined with its function tags indicating grammatical roles such as -SBJ, -PRD, and -ADV) used as tags. A null constituent is marked as a childless element whose tag corresponds to its categories. Other function tags are encoded as attributes. Figure 1 shows an example of annotated sentence in XML, and the corresponding PTB notation. The label S means sentence, NP noun phr</context>

Both annotators fail to indicate that it is mediated that was to be after IL-1 because there is no mechanism of coindexing a null element with a part of a token. This problem of ellipsis can frequently occur in research abstracts, and it can be argued that the tokenization criteria must be changed for texts in biomedical domain (Yamamoto and Satou, 2004) so that such fragment as IL-18 and mediated in IL-18-ediated should be regarede as separate tokens. The Pennsylvania biology corpus (Kulick et al., 2004) partially solves this problem by separating a token where two or more subtokens are connected with hyphens, but in the cases where a shared part of the word is not separated by a hyphen (e.g. metric of stereo- and isometric alleles) the word including the part is left uncut. The current GTB follows the GENIA corpus that it retains the tokenization criteria of the original Penn Treebank, but this must be reconsidered in future.

Manually annotated abstracts are automatically converted to the PTB format, merged with the POS annotation of the GENIA corpus (version 3.02). 3 Annotation Results So far, 500 abstracts are annotated and converted to the merged PTB format. In the merging process, we found several annotation errors. The 500 abstracts with correction of these errors are made publicly available as The GENIA Treebank Beta Version (GTB-beta). For further clean-up, we also tried to parse the corpus by the Enju parser (Miyao and Tsujii 2004), and identify the error of the corpus by investigating into the parse errors. Enju is an HPSG parser that can be trained with PTB-type corpora which is reported to have 87% accuracy on Wall Street Journal portion of Penn Treebank corpus. Currently the accuracy of the parser drops down to 82% on GTB-beta, and although proper quantitative analysis is yet to be done, it was found that the mismatches between labels of the treebank and the GENIA POS corpus (e.g. an ing form labeled as noun in the POS corpus and as the head of a verb phrase in the tree corpus) are a major source of parse error.
