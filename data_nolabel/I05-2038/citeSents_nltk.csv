2 Outline of the Corpus The base text of GTB is that of the GENIA corpus constructed at University of Tokyo CITATION, which is a collection of research abstracts selected from the search results of MEDLINE database with keywords (MeSH terms) human, blood cells and transcription factors.,,
The GENIA corpus is also annotated for part-ofspeech (POS) CITATION, and coreference is also annotated in a part of the GENIA corpus by,,
Coordination is reported to be difficult phenomena in annotation of different levels in the GENIA corpus CITATION, CITATION.,,
The GENIA term corpus annotates the full form of a technical term whose part is omitted in the surface as an attribute of the &lt;cons> element indicating a technical term CITATION.,,
CITATION) in a particular target domain, they tend to suffer from low recall due to the wide variation of the surface expression that describe a relation between a verb and its arguments.,,
Similar attempt of constructing integrated corpora is being done in University of Pennsylvania, where a corpus of MEDLINE abstracts in CYP450 and oncology domains where annotated for named entities, POS, and tree structure of sentences CITATION.,,
This problem of ellipsis can frequently occur in research abstracts, and it can be argued that the tokenization criteria must be changed for texts in biomedical domain CITATION so that such fragment as IL-18 and mediated in IL-18-ediated should be regarede as separate tokens.,,
The Pennsylvania biology corpus CITATION partially solves this problem by separating a token where two or more subtokens are connected with hyphens, but in the cases where a shared part of the word is not separated by a hyphen (e.g.,,
For further clean-up, we also tried to parse the corpus by the Enju parser CITATION, and identify the error of the corpus by investigating into the parse errors.,,
In bio-textmining, for example, training on part-of-speech (POS)-annotated GENIA corpus was reported to improve the accuracy of JunK tagger (English POS tagger) (Kazama et al., 2001) from 83.5% to 98.1% on MEDLINE abstracts CITATION, and the FraMed corpus CITATION was used to train TnT tagger on German (Brants, 2000) to improve its accuracy from 95.7% to 98% on clinical reports and other biomedical texts.,,
