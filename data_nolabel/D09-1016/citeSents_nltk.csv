CITATION use discourse trees and local syntactic dependencies in a pattern-based framework to,,
Similarly, classifierbased approaches (CITATION; CITATION; CITATION; CITATION) rely on features in the immediate context of the candidate extractions,,
CITATION a,,
The named-entity features are generated by the freely available Stanford NER tagger CITATION,,
Our previous work in event-based IE CITATION also used a pattern-based approach that applied semantic affinity patterns to relevant regions in text,,
CITATION and CITATION incorporate global information by enforcing event role or label consistency over a document or across related documents,,
The two components of the unified model presented in this paper are somewhat similar to our previous work CITATION, where we employ a relevant ,,
4 IE Evaluation 4.1 Data Sets We evaluated the performance of our IE system on two data sets: the MUC-4 terrorism corpus (Sund154 \x0cheim, 1992), and a ProMed disease outbreaks corpus (CITATION; CITATION),,
CITATION use discourse trees and local syntactic dependencies in a pattern-base,,
For our classifiers, we used the Weka CITATION implementation of Nave Bayes and the SVMLight CITATION implementation of the SVM,,
Some systems use extraction patterns (CITATION; CITATION; CITATION; CITATION), which represent the immediate contexts surrounding candidate extractions,,
A known issue with Nave Bayes classifiers is that, even though their classification accuracy is often quite reasonable, their probability estimates are often poor (CITATION; CITATION; CITATION),,
For example, most readers would agree that sentence (1) below is describing a terrorist event, while sen6 A similar strategy was used in previous work CITATION to generate a test set for the evaluation of a relevant region classifier,,
We used the Weka CITATION implementation of Nave Bayes for this baseline NB system,,
3.2.2 SVM Event Recognizer Given the all-or-nothing nature of the probability estimates that we observed from the Nave Bayes model, we decided to try using a Support Vector Machine (SVM) (CITATION; CITATION) classifier as an alternative to Nave Bayes,,
 in the MUC-4 guidelines CITATION,,
The syntactic and semantic features are generated by the Sundance/AutoSlog system CITATION,,
As our first baseline, we used AutoSlog-TS CITATION, which is a weakly-supervised, pattern-based IE system available as part of the Sundance/AutoSlog software package CITATION,,
The two components of the unified model presented in this paper are somewhat similar to our previous work CITATION, where we employ a relevant region identification phase prior to pattern-based extraction,,
The AutoSlog pattern generator CITATION is used to create the lexico-syntactic pattern features that capture local context around each noun phrase,,
CITATION use discourse trees and local syntactic dependencies in a pattern-based framework to incorporate wider context,,
4 With respect to the definition of terrorist incidents in the MUC-4 guidelines CITATION,,
1 Introduction Information Extraction (IE) systems typically use extraction patterns (e.g., CITATION, CITATION, CITATION, CITATION) or classifiers (e.g., CITATION, CITATION, CITATION, CITATION) to extract role fillers for events,,
Here too, we used the Weka CITATION implementation of the Nave Bayes model and the SVMLight CITATION implementation of the SVM,,
CITATION and CITATION incorporate global information by enforcing event role or label consistency over a document or across ,,
CITATION use discourse trees and local syntactic dependencies in a pattern-based framework to incorporate wider conte,,
