More recent work CITATION has shown that properties of reordering, source and target language complexity and relatedness can be used to predict translation quality,,
541 \x0c2 Task definition In summarization, researchers have recognized that some inputs might be more successfully handled by a particular subsystem CITATION, but little work has been done to qualify the general characteristics,,
541 \x0c2 Task definition In summarization, researchers have recognized that some inputs might be more successfully handled by a particular subsystem CITATION, but little work has been done to qualify the general characteristics of inputs that lead to suboptimal performance of systems,,
In information retrieval, the problem of predicting system performance has generated considerable interest and has led to notably good results (CITATION; CITATION; CITATION),,
CITATION describes an intelligent summarizer system that could identify documents which would be difficult to summarize based on structural properties,,
Log-likelihood ratio for words in the input Number of topic signature words (CITATION; CITATION) and percentage of signature words in the vocabulary,,
Only recently the issue has drawn attention: CITATION present an initial analysis of the factors that influence system performance in content selection,,
Indeed, varying summary size is desirable in many situations CITATION,,
t al., 2005; CITATION),,
542 \x0c3 Data We use the data from single- and multi-document evaluations performed as part of the Document Understanding Conferences CITATION from 2001 to 2004.1 Generic multi-document summarization was evaluated in all of these years, single document summaries were evaluated only in 2001 and 2002,,
For the first set of experiments, we divide all inputs based on the mean value of the average system scores as in CITATION,,
541 \x0c2 Task definition In summarization, researchers have recognized that some inputs might be more successfully handled by a particular subsystem CITATION, but little work has been done,,
4 Features For our experiments we use the features proposed, motivated and described in detail by CITATION,,
Ranking approaches are widely used in text planning and sentence ordering (CITATION; CITATION) to select the text with best structure among a set of possible candidates,,
Under the summarization framework, CITATION ranked different summaries for the same input according to their coherence,,
MT as shown by an oracle study CITATION,,
This study was based on results from the Document Understanding Conference (DUC) evaluations CITATION of multi-docum,,
This study was based on results from the Document Understanding Conference (DUC) evaluations CITATION of multi-document summarization of news,,
 a system may be configured not to answer questions for which the confidence of producing a correct answer is low, and in this way increase the overall accuracy of the system whenever it does produce an answer (CITATION; CITATION),,
In question answering for example, a system may be configured not to answer questions for which the confidence of producing a correct answer is low, and in this way increase the overall accuracy of the system whenever it does produce an answer (CITATION; CITATION),,
Automatically identifying such phrases has the potential of improving MT as shown by an oracle study CITATION,,
