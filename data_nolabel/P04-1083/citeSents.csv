We presume that readers are familiar with declarative descriptions of inference algorithms, as well as with semiring parsing CITATION,,
This logic can be used with the expectation semiring CITATION to find the maximum likelihood estimates of the parameters of a word-to-word translation model,,
To the best of our knowledge, Logic CT is the first published translation logic to be compatible with all of the semirings catalogued by CITATION, among others,,
nsional PMTG and a word-to-word translation model is similar in spirit to the way that regular grammars can help to estimate CFGs CITATION, and the way that simple translation models can help to bootstrap more sophisticated ones CITATION,,
We shall consider the common synchronization scenario where a lexicalized monolingual grammar is available for at least one component.5 Also, given a tokenized set of W -tuples of parallel sentences, it is always possible to estimate a word-to-word translation model \x02\x01 \x17\x04\x03 3 1\x06\x05 \x03 ) 3 0 1 \x18 (e.g., CITATION).6 A word-to-word translation model and a lexicalized monolingual grammar are sufficient to drive a synchronizer,,
We shall limit our attention to MTGs in Generalized Chomsky Normal Form (GCNF) CITATION,,
Bootstrapping a PMTG from a lower-dimensional PMTG and a word-to-word translation model is similar in spirit to the way that regular grammars can help to estimate CFGs CITATION, and the way that simple translation models can help to bootstrap more sophisticated ones CITATION,,
CITATION shows how a parsing logic can be combined with various semirings to c,,
Under such an MTG, the logic of word alignment is the one in CITATIONs Parser A, but without Compose inferences,,
See CITATION for definitions of cardinality, d-span, and the operators 9 and : ,,
CITATION shows how a parsing logic can be combined with various semirings to compute different kinds ,,
Under the various derivation semirings CITATION, Translator CT can store the output role templates \x1c ) 0 1 3 in each internal node of the tree,,
ago CITATION, but here we articulate it in more detail: ordinary parsing is a special case of synchronous parsing, which is a special case of translation,,
Parser C is conceptually simpler than the synchronous parsers of CITATION, CITATION, and CITATION, because it uses only one kind of item, and it never composes terminals,,
For example, CITATION showed how to reduce the computational complexity of a synchronous parser by \x07 \x17 3 \x18 , just by changing the logic,,
Translator CT can take advantage of such information without making the strong independence assumptions of CITATION,,
One application is inducing a parser in one language from a parser in another CITATION,,
This normal form allows simpler algorithm descriptions than the normal forms used by CITATION and CITATION,,
For example, we could project a part-of-speech tagger CITATION to improve our estimates in Equation 6,,
CITATION shows how a parsing logic can be combined with various semirings to compute different kinds of information about the input,,
As in CITATIONs Parser A, Parser Cs items consist of a -dimensional label vector \x02213 and a -dimensional d-span vector 4 13 .2 The items contain d-spans, rather than ordinary spans, because 2 Superscripts and subscripts indicate the range of dimensions of a vector,,
This problem was shown to be NP-hard in the one-dimensional case CITATION,,
This kind of synchronizer stands in contrast to more ad-hoc approaches (e.g., CITATION; Meyers, 1996; Wu, 1998; CITATION),,
The vehicle for the present guided tour shall be multitext grammar (MTG), which is a generalization of context-free grammar to the synchronous case CITATION,,
CITATION shows how a parsing logic can be combined with various semirings to compute different kinds of information about,,
6 Although most of the literature discusses word translation models between only two languages, it is possible to combine several 2D models into a higher-dimensional model CITATION,,
