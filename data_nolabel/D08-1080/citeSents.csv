After this initialization of the graph, we run a PageRank algorithm CITATION to determine more important nodes,,
CITATION incrementally build a graph for a document collection by combining graph-representations of sentences,,
The body of research involving Wikipedia as a source of knowledge is growing fast, as the NLP community finds more and more applications of this useful resource: it is used to acquire knowledge (CITATION; CITATION); to induce taxonomies and compute semantic relatedness (Ponzetto & Strube, 2007b; 2007a); as a source of features for text classification CITATION and for answering questions (Ahn et al., 2004; CITATION),,
At the word level, CITATION build a document graph using subject-verb-object triples, semantic normalization and coreference resolution,,
CITATION use WordNet to model a texts content relative to a topic based on lexical chains,,
CITATION build an extractive summary based on a concept lattice, which captures in a hierarchical structure co-occurrences of concepts among sentences,,
4.1 Spreading Activation To find words/NEs related to the topic we spread an activation signal starting from the topic words and their expansions (in a manner similar to CITATION, and using an algorithm inspired by CITATION), which are given a node weight of 1,,
The NIST organized competitions under the Document Understanding Conferences DUC (since 2008, Text Analysis Conference (TAC))1 events provide a forum for the comparison of a variety of approaches, ranging from knowledge poor CITATION rely exclusively on a parser, without any add,,
More advanced methods for query expansion use topic signatures words and grammatically related pairs of words that model the query and even the expected answer from sets of documents marked as relevant or not (CITATION; CITATION),,

Graph-based methods for text summarization work usually at the level of sentences (CITATION; CITATION),,
The PageRank algorithm is guaranteed to converge if the graph is aperiodic and irreducible CITATION,,

CITATION use the documents to be summarized themselves to cluster terms, and thus expanding the query internally,,
Spreading activation was introduced in the 60s and 70s to model psychological processes of memory activation in humans (CITATION; CITATION),,
We use a Lesk-like measure, and compute the overlap between the topic query and the set of hyperlinks in the first paragraph CITATION,,

CITATION build a chronological graph, in which sentence order is respected and each occurrence of a concept is a separate node,,
The most frequently used knowledge source in NLP in general, and also for summarization, is WordNet CITATION,,
CITATION have shown that expanding the query within the set of documents leads to good results,,
