1 Introduction Graph-based ranking algorithms like Kleinbergs HITS algorithm CITATION or Googles PageRank CITATION have been successfully used in citation analysis, social networks, and the analysis of the link-structure of the World Wide Web,,
4.2 Evaluation We evaluate the TextRank sentence extraction algorithm on a single-document summarization task, using 567 news articles provided during the Document Understanding Evaluations 2002 CITATION,,
Table 2 shows the results obtained on this data set of 567 news articles, including the results for TextRank (shown in bold), the baseline, and the results of the top five performing systems in the CITATION single document summarization task CITATION,,

This approach was first suggested in CITATION, where parametrized heuristic rules are combined with a genetic algorithm into a system for keyphrase extraction - GenEx - that automatically identifies keywords in a document,,
A different learning algorithm was used in CITATION, where a Naive Bayes learning scheme is applied on the document collection, with improved results observed on the same data set as used in CITATION,,
HITS CITATION or Positional Function (Herings et al., 2001) can be easily integrated into the TextRank model CITATION,,
The score of a vertex \x07 \x12 is defined as follows CITATION: \x1f!#&quot;%$#&\x18\'(*),+\x0e-.&\x16/0-21 3 46587\x089.:&lt;;\x0c=?&gt; @ ABDCFE:G;IHJ&gt;A\x1fK#&quot; 4 & where L is a damping factor that can be set between 0 and 1, which has the role of integrating into the model the probability of jumping from a given vertex to another random vertex in the graph,,
It is important to notice that although the TextRank applications described in this paper rely on an algorithm derived from Googles PageRank CITATION, other graph-based ranking algorithms such as e.g,,
Neither Turney nor Frank report on the recall of their systems, but only on precision: a 29.0% precision is achieved with GenEx CITATION for five keyphrases extracted per document, and 18.3% precision achieved with Kea CITATION for fifteen keyphrases per document,,
More recently, CITATION applies a supervised learning system to keyword extraction from abstracts, using a combination of lexical and syntactic features, proved to improve significantly over previously published results,,
Neither Turney nor Frank report on the recall of their systems, but only on precision: a 29.0% precision is achieved with GenEx CITATION for five keyphrases extracted per document, and 18.3% precis,,
For evaluation, we are using the ROUGE evaluation toolkit, which is a method based on Ngram statistics, found to be highly correlated with human evaluations CITATION,,
Table 1 lists the results obtained with TextRank, and the best results reported in CITATION,,
Co-occurrence links express relations between syntactic elements, and similar to the semantic links found useful for the task of word sense disambiguation CITATION, they represent cohesion indicators for a given text,,
This also relates to the knitting phenomenon CITATION: facts associated with words are shared in different parts of the discourse, and such relationships serve to knit the discourse together,,
This is the same test data set as used in the keyword extraction experiments reported in CITATION,,
CITATION limits the number of keywords extracted with his GenEx system to five), we are using a more flexible approach, which decides the number of keywords based on the size of the text,,
ROUGE score Ngram(1,1) stemmed System basic stemmed no-stopwords (a) (b) (c) S27 0.4814 0.5011 0.4405 S31 0.4715 0.4914 0.4160 TextRank 0.4708 0.4904 0.4229 S28 0.4703 0.4890 0.4346 S21 0.4683 0.4869 0.4222 Baseline 0.4599 0.4779 0.4162 S29 0.4502 0.4681 0.4019 Table 2: Results for single document summarization: TextRank, top 5 (out of 15) CITATION systems, and baseline,,
The factor L is usually set to 0.85 CITATION, and this is the value we are,,
Such text-oriented ranking methods can be applied to tasks ranging from automated extraction of keyphrases, to extractive summarization and word sense disambiguation CITATION,,
The results with this setting were significantly lower than the systems that consider part of speech information, which corroborates with previous observations that linguistic information helps the process of keyword extraction CITATION,,
In the context of text modeling, TextRank implements what we refer to as text surfing, which relates to the concept of text cohesion CITATION: from a certain concept in a text, we are likely to follow links to connected concepts that is, concepts that have a relation with the current concept (be that a lexical or semantic relation),,
We follow the evaluation approach from CITATION, and use the uncontrolled set of keywords,,
More recently, CITATION applies a supervised learning system to keyword extraction from abstracts, using a combination of lexical and syntactic features, pr,,
