The hyphenation task is also called orthographic syllabification CITATION.,,
In the well-known NETtalk system, for example, syllable boundaries are an input to the neural network in addition to letter identities CITATION.,,
For example, the authors of CITATION found that the TEX method is a better choice for hyphenating Norwegian.,,
The highest accuracy achieved until now for the hyphenation task is by CITATION, who use a large-margin structured learning approach.,,
Moreover, CITATION do not address the issue that false positive hyphens are worse mistakes than false negative hyphens, which we address below.,,
sh we use the parameters reported in CITATION.,,

We also cannot do a precise comparison with the method of CITATION.,,
The difference is especially pronounced for American English, for which the standard pattern collection has been manually improved over more than two decades by many people CITATION.,,
Initially, Liang optimized this pattern collection extensively by upweighting the most common words and by iteratively adding exception words found by testing the algorithm against a large dictionary from an unknown publisher CITATION.,,
For the English dataset, if we use Liangs parameters for PATGEN as reported in CITATION, we obtain overall error rate of 6.05% and seri,,
Moreover, informal experiments show that CRF training would be about eight times faster if we used CRFSGD rather than CRF++ CITATION.,,
Methods inspired by nonstatistical natural language processing research have also been proposed for the hyphenation task, in particular (CITATION; Tsalidis et al., 2004; CITATION; CITATION).,,
However, the methods for Dutch presented in CITATION were found to have worse performance than TEX.,,
Moreover, our experimental results below show that the commercial software of CITATION allows hyphens incorrectly almost three times more often than TEX.,,
To address this difficulty, we use the forward-backward algorithm (CITATION; CITATION) to estimate separately for each position the probability of a hyphen at that position.,,
The California system CITATION used a collection of rules based on the rules stated in a version of Websters dictionary.,,
The earliest hyphenation software for a language other than English may have been a rule-based program for Finnish first used in 1964 CITATION.,,
The first formal description of an algorithm for hyphenation was in a patent application submitted in 1964 CITATION.,,
Other early publications include (CITATION; CITATION).,,
The hyphenation algorithm that is by far the most widely used now is due to Liang CITATION.,,

This finding is consistent with an emerging general lesson about many natural language processing tasks: the best performance is achieved with models that are discriminative, that are trained on as large a dataset as possible, and that have a very large number of parameters but are regularized CITATION.,,

The software we use as an implementation of conditional random fields is named CRF++ CITATION.,,
This implementation offers fast training since it uses L-BFGS CITATION, a state-of-the-art quasi-Newton method for large optimization problems.,,
3 Conditional random fields A linear-chain conditional random field CITATION is a way to use a log-linear model for the sequence prediction task.,,

Stemming uses the English and Dutch versions of the Porter stemmer CITATION.4 The 65,828 English words in our dictionary produce 27,100 unique stems, while the 293,681 Dutch words produce 169,693 unique stems.,,
