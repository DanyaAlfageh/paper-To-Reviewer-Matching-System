This is a simplification of the algorithm presented in CITATION,,
Then, we integrate the task-specific and the external training data with a multicomponent classifier that simplifies the system for hierarchical word sense disambiguation presented in CITATION,,
The system accuracy on the unseen test set is summarized in the following table: Measure Precision Recall Fine all POS 71.1 71.1% Coarse all POS 78.1 78.1% Fine verbs 72.5 72.5% Coarse verbs 80.0 80.0% Fine nouns 71.3 71.3% Coarse nouns 77.4 77.4% Fine adjectives 49.7 49.7% Coarse adjectives 63.5 63.5% Overall the system has the following advantages over that of CITATION,,
Here we used the averaged perceptron CITATION, where the weight matrix used to classify the test data is the average of all of the matrices posited during training, i.e., \x01 &gt; 4 1 &gt; 1*3254 \x01 * ,,
1 Introduction One of the main difficulties in word sense classification tasks stems from the fact that word senses, such as Wordnets synsets CITATION, define very specific classes1,,
2 Features We used a set of features similar to that which was extensively described and evaluated in CITATION,,
The multiclass perceptron CITATION is an on-line learning algorithm which 4 This likely depends on the fact that the IDs encode the location in the hierarchy, even though we dont know how the IDs are generated,,
The classifier consists of two components based on the averaged multiclass perceptron (CITATION; CITATION),,
Training and test data, and the Wordnet glosses, were parsed with Charniaks parser CITATION,,
