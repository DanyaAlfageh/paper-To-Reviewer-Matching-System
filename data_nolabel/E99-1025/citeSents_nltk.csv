CITATION has shown that supertagging may be employed in information retrieval.,,
Furthermore, given a sentence aligned parallel corpus of two languages and almost parse information for the sentences of one of the languages, one can rapidly develop a grammar for the other language using supertagging, as suggested by CITATION.,,

CITATIONb) discussed a lightweight dependency analyzer which assigns dependencies assuming that each word has been assigned a unique supertag.,,
The data and evaluation procedure are similar to that used in CITATIONb).,,
The data was derived by mapping structural information from the Penn Treebank WSJ corpus into supertags from the XTAG grammar (The CITATION) using heuristics (CITATIONa)).,,
Using this data, the trigram model for supertagging achieves an accuracy of 91.37%, meaning that 91.37% of the words in the test corpus were assigned the correct supertag.1 3 Contextual Models As noted in CITATIONb), a trigram model often fails to capture the cooccurrence dependencies 1The supertagging accuracy of 92.2% reported in CITATIONb) was based on a different supertag tagset; specifically, the supertag corpus was reannotated with detailed supertags for punctuation and with a different analysis for subordinating conjunctions.,,
For example, using traditional TAG parsing methods, such are described in CITATION, it is inefficient to parse with a large LTAG grammar for English such as XTAG (The CITATION).,,
