CITATION derive estimates from web counts, and only compare at a lexical level, achieving 78.7% accuracy,,
An additional grammar rule is needed just to get a parse, but it is still not correct (CITATION, p,,
We check the correctness of the corpus by measuring interannotator agreement, by reannotating the first section, and by comparing against the sub-NP structure in DepBank CITATION,,
Finally, we test the utility of the extended Treebank for training statistical models on two tasks: NP bracketing (CITATION; CITATION) and full parsing CITATION,,
We draw our counts from a corpus of n-gram counts calculated over 1 trillion words from the web CITATION,,
CITATION has demonstrated superior performance of the dependency model using a test set of 244 (216 unique) noun compounds drawn from Groliers encyclopedia,,
4 Corpus Creation According to CITATION, asking annotators to markup base-NP structure significantly reduced annotation speed, and for this reason baseNPs were left flat,,
We used the PARC700 Dependency Bank CITATION which consists of 700 Section 23 sentences annotated with labelled dependencies,,
6.2 NP Bracketing Results With our new data set, we began running experiments similar to those carried out in the literature CITATION,,
The bracketing tool often suggests a bracketing using rules based mostly on named entity tags, which are drawn from the BBN corpus CITATION,,
4.1 Annotation Process Our annotation guidelines1 are based on those developed for annotating full sub-NP structure in the biomedical domain CITATION,,
We map the brackets to dependencies by finding the head of the NP, using the CITATION head finding rules, and then creating a dependency between each other childs head and this head,,
RECALL F-SCORE Brackets 89.17 87.50 88.33 Dependencies 96.40 96.40 96.40 Brackets, revised 97.56 98.03 97.79 Dependencies, revised 99.27 99.27 99.27 Table 1: Agreement between annotators few weeks, and increased to about 1000 words per hour after gaining more experience CITATION,,
We use the CITATION version of DepBank, a 560 sentence subset used to evaluate the RASP parser,,
kground The NP bracketing task has often been posed in terms of choosing between the left or right branching structure of three word noun compounds: (a) (world (oil prices)) Right-branching (b) ((crude oil) prices) Left-branching Most approaches to the problem use unsupervised methods, based on competing association strength between two of the words in the compound (CITATION, p,,
We use Bikels implementation CITATION of Collins parser CITATION in order to carry out these experiments, using the non-deficient Collins settings,,
1 Introduction The Penn Treebank CITATION is perhaps the most influential resource in Natural Language Processing (NLP),,
CITATION also use web counts, but incorporate additional counts from several variations on simple bigram queries, including queries for the pairs of words concatenated or joined by a hyphen,,
N N/N consumer N N/N electronics N conj and N N/N appliances N N/N retailing N chain Figure 1: CCG derivation from Hockenmaier (2003) 3 Background The NP bracketing task has often been posed in terms of choosing between the left or right branching structure of three word noun compounds: (a) (world (oil prices)) Right-branching (b) ((crude oil) prices) Left-branching Most approaches to the problem use unsupervised methods, based on competing association strength between two of the words in the compound (CITATION, p,,
240 \x0c2 Motivation Many approaches to identifying base noun phrases have been explored as part of chunking CITATION, but determining sub-NP structure is rarely addressed,,
k CITATION,,
For instance, CCGbank CITATION was created by semi-automatically converting the Treebank phrase structure to Combinatory Categorial Grammar (CCG) CITATION derivations,,
We implement a similar system to 244 \x0cCORPUS # ITEMS LEFT RIGHT Penn Treebank 5582 58.99% 41.01% Lauers 244 66.80% 33.20% Table 4: Comparison of NP bracketing corpora N-GRAM MATCH Unigrams 51.20% Adjacency bigrams 6.35% Dependency bigrams 3.85% All bigrams 5.83% Trigrams 1.40% Table 5: Lexical overlap CITATION, described in Section 3, and report on results from our own data and Lauers original set,,
The bracketing guidelines CITATION also mention the considerable difficulty of identifying the correct scope for nominal modifiers,,
