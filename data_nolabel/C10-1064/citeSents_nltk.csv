For example, CITATION and CITATION utilized weakly-supervised learning techniques for relation extraction, but they did not consider weak supervision in the context of cross-lingual relation extraction,,
The English sentences in the parallel corpus were prepro2 The parallel corpus collected and other resources are all available in our website http://isoft.postech.ac.kr/megaup/research/resources/ 567 \x0ccessed by the Stanford Parser 3 CITATION which provides a set of analyzed results including part-of-speech tag sequences, a dependency tree, and a constituent parse tree for a sentence,,
ffthe-shelf system, Stanford Named Entity Recognizer 4 CITATION for detecting entity mentions on the English sentences,,
Early studies of cross-lingual annotation projection were accomplished for lexically-based tasks; for example part-of-speech tagging CITATION, named-entit,,
While many supervised machine learning approaches have been successfully applied to the RDC task (CITATION; CITATION; CITATION; CITATION; Bunescu and Mooney, 2005; CITATION), few have focused on weakly-supervised relation extraction,,
Early studies of cross-lingual annotation projection were accomplished for lexically-based tasks; for example part-of-speech tagging CITATION, named-entity tagging CITATION, and verb classification CITATION,,
The subtree kernel method CITATION for shortest p,,
The bi-direcional alignments were joined by the grow-diag-final algorithm, which is widely used in bilingual phrase extraction CITATION for statistical machine translation,,
and Mooney, 2005; CITATION), few have focused on weakly-supervised relation extraction,,
Recently, there has been increasing interest in applications of annotation projection such as dependency parsing CITATION, mention detection CITATION, and semantic role labeling CITATION,,
The bi-sentences were processed by the GIZA++ software CITATION in the standard configuration in both English-Korean and KoreanEnglish directions,,
 For example, CITATION and CITATION utilized weakly-supervised learning techniques for relation extraction, but they did not consider weak supervision in the context of cross-lingual relation extraction,,
The Korean sentences were preprocessed by our part-of-speech tagger 7 CITATION and a dependency parser implemented by MSTParser with 3 http://nlp.stanford.edu/software/lex-parser.shtml 4 http://nlp.stanford.edu/software/CRF-NER.shtml 5 http://svmlight.joachims.org/ 6 http://disi.unitn.it/moschitt/Tree-Kernel.htm 7 http://isoft.postech.ac.kr/megaup/research/postag/ Filter Without assessing With assessing none 97,239 39,203 + heuristics 31,652 12,775 + dictionary 39,891 17,381 Table 1: Numbers of projected instances a model trained on the Sejong corpus CITATION,,
The subtree kernel method CITATION for shortest path enclosed subtrees CITATION was adopted in our model,,
The shortest path dependency kernel (Bunescu and Mooney, 2005) implemented by the subtree kernel method CITATION was adopted to learn all models,,
Many relation extraction studies have followed the Relation Detection and Characterization (RDC) task organized by the Automatic Content Extraction project CITATION to make multilingual corpora of English, Chinese and Arabic,,
In our implementation, we built a tree kernelbased SVM model using SVM-Light 5 (Joachims, 1998) and Tree Kernel Tools 6 CITATION,,
