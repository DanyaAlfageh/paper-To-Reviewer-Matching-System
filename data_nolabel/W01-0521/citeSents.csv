Models 2 and 3 of CITATION add some slightly more elaborate features to the probability model, as do the additions of CITATION to the model of CITATION,,
ion, conjunctions, and base noun phrases, are described in CITATION,,
While this does not re ect the state-of-the-art performance on the WSJ task achieved by the more the complex models of CITATION and CITATION, we regard it as a reasonable baseline for t,,
The probability models of CITATION, CITATION and CITATION di\x0ber in their details but are based on similar features,,
CITATION \x0cnd that subcategorization frequencies for certain verbs vary signi\x0ccantly between the Wall Street Journal corpus and the mixed-genre Brown corpus, but that they vary less so between genre-balanced British and American corpora,,
3 The Parsing Model We take as our baseline parser the statistical model of Model 1 of CITATION,,
As shown by CITATION, this criterion is an approximation of the relative entropy between the original and pruned distributions, but does not take into account the e\x0bect of changing the backo\x0b weight on other events\&apos; probabilities,,
Further details of the model, including the distance features used and special handling of punctuation, conjunctions, and base noun phrases, are described in CITATION,,
These word pair relations, also called lexical bigrams CITATION, are reminiscentof dependency grammarssuch as Me\x13 l\x15 cuk (1988) and the link grammar of Sleator and Temperley(1993),,
Relatively few quantitative parsing results have been reported on other corpora (though see CITATION for results on Switchboard, as well as CITATION for results on Czech and CITATION for bootstrapping from WSJ to ATIS),,
Of particular importance to statistical parsers is the investigation of frequencies for verb subcategorizations such as CITATION,,
While this does not re ect the state-of-the-art performance on the WSJ task achieved by the more the complex models of CITATION and CITATION, we ,,
While this does not re ect the state-of-the-art performance on the WSJ task achieved by the more the complex models of CITATION and CITATION, we regard it as a reasonable baseline for the investigation of corpus e\x0bects on statistical parsing,,
Of particular interest are the automatic clusterings of lexical co-occurrences used in CITATION and CITATION,,
 of CITATION, CITATION and CITATION di\x0ber in their details but are based on similar features,,
CITATION investigated variation in a number syntactic features over genres, or registers, of language,,
Signi\x0ccant e\x0bort has gone into developing techniques for pruning statistical language models for speech recognition, and we borrow from this work, using the weighted di\x0berence technique of CITATION,,
The parsing models of CITATION and CITATION add more complex features to the parsing model that we use as our baseline,,
While this does not re ect the state-of-the-art performance on the WSJ task achieved by the more the complex models of CITATION and CITATION, we regard it as a re,,
The techniques of CITATION, CITATION, and CITATION achieved roughly comparable results using the same sets of training and test data,,
