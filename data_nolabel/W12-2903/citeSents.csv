CITATION define an ontology where pieces of handcoded knowledge are stored and realized within several syntactic templates,,
The Frametalker system CITATION uses contextual frames basic sentences for different contexts with a set vocabulary for each,,
This system employs a semantic parser to capture the meaning of the input words and generates using the Functional Unification Formalism (FUF) system CITATION,,
The Stanford tools perform part of speech tagging CITATION, constituent and dependency parsing CITATION, named entity recognition CITATION, and coreference resolution CITATION,,
CITATION extend this technology using ASR on the speech of the interlocutor,,
Indeed small talk is central to smooth-flowing conversation CITATION,,
Similar issues arise in semantic authoring systems CITATION, where at each step of the sentence creation process, the system offers possible symbols for a small set of concepts, and the user can sel,,
One approach relies on telegraphic input, where full sentences are constructed from a set of uninflected words, as in the Compansion system CITATION,,
For this experiment, we used the publicly available ALICE CITATION, which won the Loebner Prize (a Turing test) in 2000, 2001, and 2004,,
Recent work reported in CITATION suggests one way in which the results of a language modeling system and those of a human coconstructor may be integrated into a single system, and such an approach could easily be applied here,,
Similar issues arise in semantic authoring systems CITATION, where at each step of the sentence creation process, the system offers possible symbols for a small set of concepts, and the user can select which is intended,,
2 Previous Work CITATION discuss how AAC technology can increase social interaction by having the utterance, rather than the letter or word, be the basic unit of communication,,
WordKeys CITATION allows users to access stored phrases by entering key words,,
In essence, ALICE is a much more sophisticated version of the 1960s Eliza program CITATION,,
 that attempt to reduce the amount of effort needed to input a sentence have include semantic compaction CITATION, and lexicon- or languagemodel-based word prediction (CITATION; CITATION; CITATION; CITATION; CITATION; CITATION; CITATION), among others,,
Over the past thirty years, solutions that attempt to reduce the amount of effort needed to input a sentence have include semantic compaction CITATION, and lexicon- or languagemodel-based word prediction (CITATION; CITATION; CITATION; CITATION; CITATION; CITATION; CITATION), among others,,
CITATION introduce a system that utilizes scripts for specific situations,,
Such approaches have been argued to be beneficial in that they can speed up the conversation, thus making it appear more felicitous CITATION,,
The method of using features of a turn to predict features of the next turn is related to the work reported in CITATION, though their goal was to analyze dialog coherence rather than to predict the next utterance,,
Many modern AAC systems therefore provide canned small-talk phrases (CITATION; CITATION),,
The closest such corpus is Switchboard CITATION, which contains 2,400 two-sided conversations with about 1.4 million words,,
As a first look at the feasibility of this approach, we use the Midge generator CITATION, rebuilding its models from the soap dialogues,,
In order to use the chatbot for this task, we use an AIML interpreter CITATION on the most recent set of ALICE knowledge.1 ALICE was given the utterances for each conversation in our development testing set, which allows the system to store some of the dialogue context under its THAT and TOPIC 1 http://code.google.com/p/aiml-en-us-foundation-alice/, retrieved February 2012,,
