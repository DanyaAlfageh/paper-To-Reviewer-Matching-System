Recall is computed based on the number of identified pairs from a sample of 100 intradocument coreference and bridging relations from the annotated dataset described in CITATION,,
anguage processing applications, including information extraction CITATION and question answering CITATION,,
Surprisingly, discourse hardly received any treatment in this task beyond the standard use of coreference resolution (CITATION; CITATION), and an attempt to address globally-known information by removing from H words that appear in document headlines CITATION,,
Consequently, little effort was invested by the challenges participants to address discourse issues beyond the standard substitution of coreferring nominal phrases, using publicly available tools such as JavaRap CITATION or OpenNLP1, e.g,,
To determine entailment, BIUTEE performs the following main steps: Preprocessing First, all documents are parsed and processed with standard tools for named entity recognition CITATION and coreference resolution,,
Despite the above, apparently, IR techniques provided hard-to-beat baselines for the RTE Search task CITATION, outperforming every other system that relied on inference without IR-based pre-filtering,,
Under TE, the relationship between a text (T) and a textual assertion (hypothesis, H) is defined such that T entails H if humans reading T would infer that H is most likely true CITATION,,
Hypotheses were manually generated based on Summary Content Units CITATION, clause-long statements taken from manual summaries of the corpora.,,
In RTE-3 CITATION, where some paragraph-long texts were included, intersentential relations became relevant for correct inference,,
In this setting, texts need to be interpreted based on their entire discourse (CITATIONa), hence attending to discourse issues becomes essential,,
Second, many bridging relations CITATION are realized in the form of global information perceived as known for entire documents,,
Textual Entailment (TE) is a generic framework for applied semantic inference CITATION,,
BIU-DISC uses three base-classifiers (n = 3): SVMperf CITATION, and Nave Bayes and Logistic Regression from the WEKA package CITATION,,
le tools such as JavaRap CITATION or OpenNLP1, e.g,,
This state of affairs has started to change with the recent introduction of the RTE Pilot Search task (CITATIONb), in which assessed texts are situated within complete documen,,
This state of affairs has started to change with the recent introduction of the RTE Pilot Search task (CITATIONb), in which assessed texts are situated within complete documents,,
1st sentence entailing title CITATION showed that the first sentence in a news article typically entails the articles title,,
Yet, such applications typically only handle a narrow aspect of discourse, addressing coreference by term substitution (CITATION; CITATION),,
4 The Baseline RTE System In this work we used BIUTEE, Bar-Ilan University Textual Entailment Engine (Bar-Haim et al., 2008; CITATION), a state of the art RTE system, as a baseline and as a basis for our discourse-based enhancements,,
5 http://lucene.apache.org 6 The best one is an earlier version of this work CITATION; the second is MacKinlay and Baldwins (2009),,
Surprisingly, discourse hardly received any treatment in this task beyond the standard use of coreference resolution (CITATION; CITATION), and an attempt to address,,
Hypotheses were manually generated based on Summary Content Units CITATION, clause-long statements taken from manual summaries of the corpora,,

006), and Nave Bayes and Logistic Regression from the WEKA package CITATION,,
TE has been successfully applied to a variety of natural language processing applications, including information extraction CITATION and question answering CITATION,,
Section 5.2), where document frequencies were computed based on about half a million documents from the TIPSTER corpus CITATION,,
 treatment in this task beyond the standard use of coreference resolution (CITATION; CITATION), and an attempt to address globally-known information by removing from H words that appear in document headlines CITATION,,
