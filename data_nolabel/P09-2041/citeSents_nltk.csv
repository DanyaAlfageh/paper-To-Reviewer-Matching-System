3 Method 3.1 Standard text classification approach We take our starting point from topic-based text classification (CITATION; CITATION) and sentiment classification (CITATION; CITATION).,,
To implement this method, we first use the Stanford Named Entity Recognizer4 CITATION to identify the set of person and organisation entities, E, from each article in the corpus.,,
Bi-normal separation feature scaling: BNS CITATION has been shown to outperform other established feature representation schemes on a wide range of text classification tasks.,,

SVM classification is performed with SVMlight CITATION using a linear kernel and the default parameter settings.,,
It is somewhat similar to the more widely-researched text classification tasks of spam filtering (Androutsopoulos et al., 2000) and sentiment classification CITATION, in that: (a) it is a binary classification task, and (b) it is an intrinsically semantic task, i.e.,,
