For example, the parent of the left-hand side (LHS) can be annotated onto the label of the LHS category CITATION, hence differentiating, for instance, between expansions of a VP with parent S and parent VP,,
Producing a coarse chart as efficiently as possible is thus crucial (CITATION; CITATION), making these factorizations particularly useful,,
CITATIONb) showed ,,
accuracy tradeoff in stochastic context-free parsing, which can be explained by the grammar factor in the running-time complexity of standard parsing algorithms such as the CYK algorithm (CITATION; CITATION),,
Probability estimates of the RHS given the LHS are often smoothed by making a Markov assumption regarding the conditional independence of a category on those more than k categories away (CITATION; CITATION): P(X Y1...Yn)= P(Y1|X) n Y i=2 P(Yi|X, Y1 Yi1) P(Y1|X) n Y i=2 P(Yi|X, Yik Yi1),,
We also present a result using parent annotation CITATION with a 2nd-order Markov assumption,,
CITATIONb) showed that, by making certain linguistically-motivated node label annotations, but avoiding certain other kinds of state splits (mainly lexical annotations) models of relatively high accuracy can be built without resorting to smoothing,,
perceptron-trained tagger, using the tagger documented in CITATION,,
In the case of bilexical grammars, where categories in binary grammars are annotated with their lexical heads, the grammar factor contributes an additional O(n2|VD|3) complexity, leading to an overall O(n5|VD|3) parsing complexity, where |VD |is the number of delexicalized non-terminals CITATION,,
We then trained a MaxEnt reranker on sections 2-21, using the approach outlined in CITATION, via the publicly available reranking code from that paper.6 We used the default features that come with that package,,
CITATIONb) showed that, by making certain linguistically-motivated node label annotations, but avoiding certain other kinds of sta,,
(4) 3.5 Log likelihood ratio Pearsons chi-squared statistic assumes a normal or approximately normal distribution, but that assumption typically does not hold for the occurrences of rare events CITATION,,
ized non-terminals CITATION,,
We used the k-best decoding algorithm of CITATION with our CYK parser, using on-demand k-best backpointer calculation,,
One common strategy in statistical parsing is what can be termed an approximate coarse-to-fine approach: a simple PCFG is used to prune the search space to which richer and more complex models are applied subsequently (CITATION; CITATION),,
Finally, Section 4 reports the results of parsing experiments using our exhaustive k-best CYK parser with the concise PCFGs induced from the Penn WSJ treebank CITATION,,
Even with special modifications to the basic CYK algorithm, such as those presented by CITATION, improvements to the stochastic model are obtained at the expense of efficiency,,
