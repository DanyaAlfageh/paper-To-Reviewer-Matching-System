The consistency checking is inspired by CITATION,,
The flow using non-local features in two-stage architecture 2.4 Results We employ BIOE1 label scheme for the NER task because we found it performs better than IOB2 on Bakeoff 2006 CITATION NER MSRA and CityU corpora,,
Recently, Conditional Random Fields1 (CRFs) CITATION have been successfully employed in various natural language processing tasks and achieve the state-of-the-art performance, in our system, we use it as the basic framework and incorporate some other postprocessing measures for CWS, NER and POS tagging tasks,,
Classifiers built on such dataset typically have a higher precision and a lower recall and tend to overproduce the NONE 1 We use the CRF++ V4.5 software from http://chasen.org/~taku/software/CRF++/ 90 Sixth SIGHAN Workshop on Chinese Language Processing \x0cclass CITATION,,
In the first approach, heuristic rules are used to find the dependencies CITATION or penalties for label inconsistency are required to handset ad-hoc CITATION,,
Up to now, few researches have been devoted to this issue; existing works mainly focus on using the non-local information for improving NER label consistency CITATION,,
Taking SIGHAN Bakeoff 2006 CITATION as an example, the recall is lower about 5% than the precision for each submitted system on MSRA and CityU closed track,,
