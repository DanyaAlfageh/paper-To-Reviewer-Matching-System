This paper presents a novel semi-supervised method that employs a learning framework called structural learning (Ando and CITATION), which seeks to discover shared predictive structures (i.e,,
A formal PAC-style analysis can be found in (Ando and CITATION),,
See (Ando and CITATION) for the precise formulation,,
Similarly, CITATION used word-cluster memberships induced from an unannotated corpus as features for named entity chunking,,

Previous best results: FIJZ03 CITATION, CN03 CITATION, KSNM03 CITATION,,
The training algorithm is stochastic gradient descent, which is argued to perform well for regularized convex ERM learning formulations CITATION,,
This paper presents a novel semi-supervised method that employs a learning framework called structural learning (Ando and CITATION), which seeks to dis,,
Our implementation follows the original work CITATION,,
CITATION, CITATION),,
For example, co-training CITATION automatically bootstraps labels, and such labels are not necessarily reliable CITATION,,

Since CITATIONs experiments used a proprietary corpus, direct performance comparison is not possible,,
Comparison with previous best results: KM01 CITATION, CM03 CITATION, SP03 CITATION, ZDJ02 CITATION,,
5.1 Features Our feature representation is a slight modification of a simpler configuration (without any gazetteer) in CITATION, as shown in Figure 2,,
2 We also tested self-training with bagging, which CITATION used for co-reference resolution,,
The formal derivation can be found in (Ando and CITATION),,
6.1 Features and auxiliary problems Our feature representation is a slight modification of a simpler configuration (without linguistic features) in CITATION, as shown in Figure 6,,
