<bodyText confidence="0.998187285714285">
In pro-drop languages, the detection of
explicit subjects, zero subjects and non-
referential impersonal constructions is cru-
cial for anaphora and co-reference resolu-
tion. While the identification of explicit
and zero subjects has attracted the atten-
tion of researchers in the past, the auto-
matic identification of impersonal construc-
tions in Spanish has not been addressed yet
and this work is the first such study. In
this paper we present a corpus to under-
pin research on the automatic detection of
these linguistic phenomena in Spanish and
a novel machine learning-based methodol-
ogy for their computational treatment. This
study also provides an analysis of the fea-
tures, discusses performance across two
different genres and offers error analysis.
The evaluation results show that our system
performs better in detecting explicit sub-
jects than alternative systems.

1 Introduction

<bodyText confidence="0.999330877551021">
Subject ellipsis is the omission of the subject in
a sentence. We consider not only missing refer-
ential subject (zero subject) as manifestation of
ellipsis, but also non-referential impersonal con-
structions.
Various natural language processing (NLP)
tasks benefit from the identification of ellip-
tical subjects, primarily anaphora resolution
(Mitkov, 2002) and co-reference resolution (Ng
and Cardie, 2002). The difficulty in detect-
ing missing subjects and non-referential pronouns
has been acknowledged since the first studies on

the computational treatment of anaphora (Hobbs,
1977; Hirst, 1981). However, this task is of cru-
cial importance when processing pro-drop lan-
guages since subject ellipsis is a pervasive phe-
nomenon in these languages (Chomsky, 1981).
For instance, in our Spanish corpus, 29% of the
subjects are elided.
Our method is based on classification of all ex-
pressions in subject position, including the recog-
nition of Spanish non-referential impersonal con-
structions which, to the best of our knowledge,
has not yet been addressed. The necessity of iden-
tifying such kind of elliptical constructions has
been specifically highlighted in work about Span-
ish zero pronouns (Ferrandez and Peral, 2000)
and co-reference resolution (Recasens and Hovy,
2009).
The main contributions of this study are:
A public annotated corpus in Spanish to
compare different strategies for detecting ex-
plicit subjects, zero subjects and impersonal
constructions.
The first ML based approach to this problem
in Spanish and a thorough analysis regarding
features, learnability, genre and errors.
The best performing algorithms to automati-
cally detect explicit subjects and impersonal
constructions in Spanish.
The remainder of the paper is organized as fol-
lows. Section 2 describes the classes of Spanish
subjects, while Section 3 provides a literature re-
view. Section 4 describes the creation and the an-
notation of the corpus and in Section 5 the ma-
chine learning (ML) method is presented. The

Literature related to ellipsis in NLP (Ferrandez
and Peral, 2000; Rello and Illisei, 2009a; Mitkov,
2010) and linguistic theory (Bosque, 1989; Bru-
cart, 1999; Real Academia Espanola, 2009) has
served as a basis for establishing the classes of
this work.
Explicit subjects are phonetically realized and
their syntactic position can be pre-verbal or post-
verbal. In the case of post-verbal subjects (a), the
syntactic position is restricted by some conditions
(Real Academia Espanola, 2009).
(a) Careceran de validez las disposiciones que con-
tradigan otra de rango superior.1
The dispositions which contradict higher range
ones will not be valid.
Zero subjects (b) appear as the result of a nomi-
nal ellipsis. That is, a lexical element the elliptic
subject, which is needed for the interpretation of
the meaning and the structure of the sentence, is
elided; therefore, it can be retrieved from its con-
text. The elision of the subject can affect the en-
tire noun phrase and not just the noun head when
a definite article occurs (Brucart, 1999).
(b) Fue refrendada por el pueblo espanol.
(It) was countersigned by the people of Spain.
The class of impersonal constructions is
formed by impersonal clauses (c) and reflex-
ive impersonal clauses with particle se (d) (Real
Academia Espanola, 2009).

Identification of non-referential pronouns, al-
though a crucial step in co-reference and anaphora
resolution systems (Mitkov, 2010),2 has been ap-
plied only to the pleonastic it in English (Evans,
2001; Boyd et al., 2005; Bergsma et al., 2008)
and expletive pronouns in French (Danlos, 2005).
Machine learning methods are known to perform
better than rule-based techniques for identifying
non-referential expressions (Boyd et al., 2005).
However, there is some debate as to which ap-
proach may be optimal in anaphora resolution
systems (Mitkov and Hallett, 2007).
Both English and French texts use an ex-
plicit word, with some grammatical information
(a third person pronoun), which is non-referential
(Mitkov, 2010). By contrast, in Spanish, non-
referential expressions are not realized by exple-
tive or pleonastic pronouns but rather by a certain
kind of ellipsis. For this reason, it is easy to mis-
take them for zero pronouns, which are, in fact,
referential.
Previous work on detecting Spanish subject el-
lipsis focused on distinguishing verbs with ex-
plicit subjects and verbs with zero subjects (zero
pronouns), using rule-based methods (Ferrandez
and Peral, 2000; Rello and Illisei, 2009b). The
Ferrandez and Peral algorithm (2000) outper-
forms the (Rello and Illisei, 2009b) approach
with 57% accuracy in identifying zero subjects.
In (Ferrandez and Peral, 2000), the implementa-
tion of a zero subject identification and resolution
module forms part of an anaphora resolution sys-
tem.
ML based studies on the identification of
explicit non-referential constructions in English
present accuracies of 71% (Evans, 2001), 87.5%
(Bergsma et al., 2008) and 88% (Boyd et al.,
2005), while 97.5% is achieved for French (Dan-
los, 2005). However, in these languages, non-
referential constructions are explicit and not omit-
ted which makes this task more challenging for
Spanish.

The corpus is named after its annotated content
Explicit Subjects, Zero Subjects and Impersonal
Constructions (ESZIC es Corpus).
To the best of our knowledge, the existing cor-
pora annotated with elliptical subjects belong to
other genres. The Blue Book (handbook) and
Lexesp (journalistic texts) used in (Ferrandez and
Peral, 2000) contain zero subjects but not imper-
sonal constructions. On the other hand, the Span-
ish AnCora corpus based on journalistic texts in-
cludes zero pronouns and impersonal construc-
tions (Recasens and Mart, 2010) while the Z-
corpus (Rello and Illisei, 2009b) comprises legal,
instructional and encyclopedic texts but has no an-
notated impersonal constructions.
The ESZIC corpus contains a total of 6,827
verbs including 1,793 zero subjects. Except for
AnCora-ES, with 10,791 elliptic pronouns, our
corpus is larger than the ones used in previous ap-
proaches: about 1,830 verbs including zero and
explicit subjects in (Ferrandez and Peral, 2000)
(the exact number is not mentioned in the pa-
per) and 1,202 zero subjects in (Rello and Illisei,
2009b).
The corpus was parsed by Connexors Ma-
chinese Syntax (Connexor Oy, 2006), which re-
turns lexical and morphological information as
well as the dependency relations between words
by employing a functional dependency grammar
(Tapanainen and Jarvinen, 1997).
To annotate our corpus we created an annota-
tion tool that extracts the finite clauses and the
annotators assign to each example one of the de-
fined annotation tags. Two volunteer graduate stu-
dents of linguistics annotated the verbs after one
training session. The annotations of a third volun-
teer with the same profile were used to compute
the inter-annotator agreement. During the anno-
tation phase, we evaluated the adequacy and clar-
ity of the annotation guidelines and established a
typology of the rising borderline cases, which is
included in the annotation guidelines.
Table 1 shows the linguistic and formal criteria
used to identify the chosen categories that served
as the basis for the corpus annotation. For each
tag, in addition to the two criteria that are crucial
for identifying subject ellipsis ([ elliptic] and
[ referential]) a combination of syntactic, se-
mantic and discourse knowledge is also encoded
during the annotation. The linguistic motivation
for each of the three categories is shown against
the thirteen annotation tags to which they belong
(Table 1).
Afterwards, each of the tags are grouped in one
of the three main classes.
Explicit subjects: [- elliptic, + referential].
Zero subjects: [+ elliptic, + referential].
Impersonal constructions: [+ elliptic, - refer-
ential].
Of these annotated verbs, 71% have an explicit
subject, 26% have a zero subject and 3% belong
to an impersonal construction (see Table 2).

5.1 Features
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.975659214285714">
We built the training data from the annotated cor-
pus and defined fourteen features. The linguisti-
cally motivated features are inspired by previous
ML approaches in Chinese (Zhao and Ng, 2007)
and English (Evans, 2001). The values for the fea-
tures (see Table 4) were derived from information
provided both by Connexors Machinese Syntax
parser and a set of lists.
We can describe each of the features as broadly
belonging to one of ten classes, as follows:
1 PARSER: the presence or absence of a sub-
ject in the clause, as identified by the parser.
We are not aware of a formal evaluation of
Connexors accuracy. It presents an accu-
racy of 74.9% evaluated against our corpus
and we used it as a simple baseline.
2 CLAUSE: the clause types considered are:
main clauses, relative clauses starting with a
complex conjunction, clauses starting with a
simple conjunction, and clauses introduced
using punctuation marks (commas, semi-
colons, etc). We implemented a method
to identify these different types of clauses,
as the parser does not explicitly mark the
boundaries of clauses within sentences. The
method took into account the existence of a
finite verb, its dependencies, the existence of
conjunctions and punctuation marks.

the subject of the clause are represented by
the number of noun phrases in the clause that

10 SE: a binary feature encoding the presence
or absence of the Spanish particle se when it
occurs immediately before or after the verb
or with a maximum of one token lying be-
tween the verb and itself. Particle se occurs
in passive reflex clauses with zero subjects
and in some impersonal constructions.
11 A: a binary feature encoding the presence or
absence of the Spanish preposition a in the
clause. Since the distinction between passive
reflex clauses with zero subjects and imper-
sonal constructions sometimes relies on the
appearance of preposition a (to, for, etc.).
For instance, example (e) is a passive reflex
clause containing a zero subject while exam-
ple (s) is an impersonal construction.

In Spanish, when a finite verb appears in a subordinate
clause, its tense and mood can assist in recognition of these
features in the verb of the main clause and help to enforce
some restrictions required by this verb, especially when both
verbs share the same referent as subject.

corpus was partitioned into training and tested
using ten-fold cross-validation for randomly or-
dered instances in both cases. The lazy learn-
ing classifier K* (Cleary and Trigg, 1995), us-
ing a blending parameter of 40%, was the best
performing one, with an accuracy of 87.6% for
ten-fold cross-validation. K* differs from other
instance-based learners in that it computes the dis-
tance between two instances using a method mo-
tivated by information theory, where a maximum
entropy-based distance function is used (Cleary
and Trigg, 1995). Table 5 shows the results
for each class using ten-fold cross-validation.
In contrast to previous work, the K* algorithm
(Cleary and Trigg, 1995) was found to provide the
most accurate classification in the current study.
Other approaches have employed various clas-
sification algorithms, including JRip in WEKA
(Muller, 2006), with precision of 74% and recall
of 60%, and K-nearest neighbors in TiMBL: both
in (Evans, 2001) with precision of 73% and recall
of 69%, and in (Boyd et al., 2005) with precision
of 82% and recall of 71%.
Since there is no previous ML approach for this
task in Spanish, our baselines for the explicit sub-
jects and the zero subjects are the parser output
and the previous rule-based work with the high-
est performance (Ferrandez and Peral, 2000). For
the impersonal constructions the baseline is a sim-
ple greedy algorithm that classifies as an imper-
sonal construction every verb whose lemma is cat-
egorized as a verb with impersonal use according
to the RAE dictionary (Real Academia Espanola,
2001).
Our method outperforms the Connexor parser
which identifies the explicit subjects but makes no
distinction between zero subjects and impersonal
constructions. Connexor yields 74.9% overall ac-
curacy and 80.2% and 65.6% F-measure for ex-
plicit and elliptic subjects, respectively.

a precision of 87% for explicit subjects compared
to 80%, and a precision of 87% for zero subjects
compared to their 98%. The overall accuracy
is the same for both techniques, 87.5%, but our
results are more balanced. Nevertheless, the
approaches and corpora used in both studies are
different, and hence it is not possible to do a fair
comparison. For example, their corpus has 46%
of zero subjects while ours has only 26%.
For impersonal constructions our method out-
performs the RAE baseline (precision 6.5%,
recall 77.7%, F-measure 12.0% and accuracy
70.4%). Table 6 summarizes the comparison. The
low performance of the RAE baseline is due to the
fact that verbs with impersonal use are often am-
biguous. For these cases, we first tagged them as
ambiguous and then, we defined additional crite-
ria after analyzing then manually. The resulting
annotated criteria are stated in Table 1.

Through these analyses we aim to extract the most
effective features and the information that would
complement the output of an standard parser to
achieve this task. We also examine the learning
process of the algorithm to find out how many in-
stances are needed to train it efficiently and de-
termine how much Elliphant is genre dependent.
The analyses indicate that our approach is robust:
it performs nearly as well with just six features,
has a steep learning curve, and seems to general-
ize well to other text collections.

ing data, which were selected using each WEKA
attribute selection algorithm and performed the
classifications over the complete training data, us-
ing only the different groups features selected.
The most effective group of six features (NH-
PREV, PARSER, NHTOT, POSpos, PERSON,
LEMMA) was the one selected by WEKAs Sym-
metricalUncertAttribute technique, which gives
an accuracy of 83.5%. The most frequently
selected features by all methods are PARSER,
POSpos, and NHTOT, and they alone get an accu-
racy of 83.6% together. As expected, the two pairs
of features that perform best (both 74.8% accu-
racy) are PARSER with either POSpos or NHTOT.
Based on how frequent each feature is selected
by WEKAs attribute selection algorithms, we can
rank the features as following: (1) PARSER,
(2) NHTOT, (3) POSpos, (4) NHPREV and (5)
LEMMA.

<bodyText confidence="0.993856736842106">
Second, a set of experiments was conducted
in which features were selected on the basis
of the degree of computational effort needed to
generate them. We propose two sets of fea-
tures. One group corresponds to simple fea-
tures, whose values can be obtained by trivial
exploitation of the tags produced in the parsers
output (PARSER, LEMMA, PERSON, POSpos,
POSpre). The second group of features, com-
plex features (CLAUSE, AGREE, NHPREV,
NHTOT, VERBtype) have values that required the
implementation of more sophisticated modules to
identify the boundaries of syntactic constituents
such as clauses and noun phrases. The accuracy
obtained when the classifier exclusively exploits
complex features is 82.6% while for simple
features is 79.9%. No impersonal constructions
are identified when only complex features are
used.

<bodyText confidence="0.9986369375">
In the third experiment, to estimate the weight
of each feature, classifications were made in
which each feature was omitted from the train-
ing instances that were presented to the classifier.
Omission of all but one of the simple features
led to a reduction in accuracy, justifying their in-
clusion in the training instances. Nevertheless, the
majority of features present low informativeness
except for feature A which does not make any
meaningful contribution to the classification. The
feature PARSER presents the greatest difference
in performance (86.3% total accuracy); however,
this is no big loss, considering it is the main fea-
ture. Hence, as most features do not bring a sig-
nificant loss in accuracy, the features need to be
combined to improve the performance.

6.2 Learning Analysis
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999464027027027">
The learning curve of Figure 1 (left) presents the
increase of the performance obtained by Elliphant
using the training data randomly ordered. The
performance reaches its plateau using 90% of the
training instances. Using different ordering of the
training set we obtain the same result.
Figure 1 (right) presents the precision for each
class and overall in relation to the number of train-
ing instances for each one of them. Recall grows
similarly to precision. Under all conditions, sub-
jects are classified with a high precision since the
information given by the parser (collected in the
features) achieves an accuracy of 74.9% for the
identification of explicit subjects.
The impersonal construction class has the
fastest learning curve. When utilizing a training
set of only 163 instances (90% of the training
data), it reaches a precision of 63.2%. The un-
stable behaviour for impersonal constructions can
be attributed to not having enough training data
for that class, since impersonals are not frequent
in Spanish. On the other hand, the zero subject
class is learned more gradually.
The learning curve for the explicit subject class
is almost flat due to the great variety of subjects
occurring in the training data. In addition, reach-
ing a precision of 92.0% for explicit subjects us-
ing just 20% of the training data is far more ex-
pensive in terms of the number of training in-
stances (978) as seen in Figure 1 (right). Actually,
with just 20% of the training data we can already
achieve a precision of 85.9%.
This demonstrates that Elliphant does not need
very large sets of expensive training data and
is able to reach adequate levels of performance
when exploiting far fewer training instances. In
fact, we see that we only need a modest set of

6.3 Impact of Genre
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.995848909090909">
To examine the influence of the different text gen-
res on this method, we divided our training data
into two subgroups belonging to different genres
(legal and health) and analyze the differences.
A comparative evaluation using ten-fold cross-
validation over the two subgroups shows that El-
liphant is more successful when classifying in-
stances of explicit subjects in legal texts (89.8%
accuracy) than health texts (85.4% accuracy).
This may be explained by the greater uniformity
of the sentences in the legal genre compared to
ones from the health genre, as well as the fact that
there are a larger number of explicit subjects in the
legal training data (2,739 compared with 2,116 in
the health texts). Further, texts from the health
genre present the additional complication of spe-
cialized named entities and acronyms, which are
used quite frequently. Similarly, better perfor-
mance in the detection of zero subjects and imper-
sonal sentences in the health texts may be due to
their more frequent occurrence and hence greater
learnability.

We have also studied the effect of training the
classifier on data derived from one genre and test-
ing on instances derived from a different genre.
Table 7 shows that instances from legal texts
are more homogeneous, as the classifier obtains
higher accuracy when testing and training only on
legal instances (90.0%). In addition, legal texts
are also more informative, because when both le-
gal and health genres are combined as training
data, only instances from the health genre show
a significant increased accuracy (93.7%). These
results reveal that the health texts are the most het-
erogeneous ones. In fact, we also found subsets of
the legal documents where our method achieves
an accuracy of 94.6%, implying more homoge-
neous texts.

6.4 Error Analysis
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.99953">
Since the features of the system are linguisti-
cally motivated, we performed a linguistic anal-
ysis of the erroneously classified instances to find
out which patterns are more difficult to classify
and which type of information would improve the
method (Rello et al., 2011).
We extract the erroneously classified instances
of our training data and classify the errors. Ac-
cording to the distribution of the errors per class
(Table 8) we take into account the following four
classes of errors for the analysis: (a) impersonal
constructions classified as zero subjects, (b) im-
personal constructions classified as explicit sub-
jects, (c) zero subjects classified as explicit sub-
jects, and (d) explicit subjects classified as zero
subjects. The diagonal numbers are the true pre-
dicted cases. The classification of impersonal
constructions is less balanced than the ones for
explicit subjects and zero subjects. Most of the
wrongly identified instances are classified as ex-
plicit subject, given that this class is the largest
one. On the other hand, 25% of the zero subjects
are classified as explicit subject, while only 8% of

For the analysis we first performed an explo-
ration of the feature values which allows us to
generate smaller samples of the groups of errors
for the further linguistic analyses. Then, we ex-
plore the linguistic characteristics of the instances
by examining the clause in which the instance ap-
pears in our corpus. A great variety of different
patterns are found. We mention only the linguistic
characteristics in the errors which at least double
the corpus general trends.
In all groups (a-d) there is a tendency of using
the following elements: post-verbal prepositions,
auxiliary verbs, future verbal tenses, subjunctive
verbal mode, negation, punctuation marks ap-
pearing before the verb and the preceding noun
phrases, concessive and adverbial subordinate
clauses. In groups (a) and (b) the lemma of the
verb may play a relevant role, for instance verb
haber (there is/are) appears in the errors seven
times more than in the training while verb tratar
(to be about, to deal with) appears 12 times
more. Finally, in groups (c) and (d) we notice
the frequent occurrence of idioms which include
verbs with impersonal uses, such as es decir (that
is to say) and words which can be subject on their
own i.e. ambos (both) or todo (all).

In this study we learn which is the most accurate
approach for identifying explicit subjects and im-
personal constructions in Spanish and which are
the linguistic characteristics and features that help
to perform this task. The corpus created is freely
available online.5 Our method complements pre-

A possible future avenue to explore could be
to combine our approach with Ferrandez and
Peral (Ferrandez and Peral, 2000) by employing
both algorithms in sequence: first Ferrandez and
Perals algorithm to detect all zero subjects and
then ours to identify explicit subjects and imper-
sonals. Assuming that the same accuracy could be
maintained, on our data set the combined perfor-
mance could potentially be in the range of 95%.
Future research goals are the extrinsic evalua-
tion of our system by integrating our system in
NLP tasks and its adaptation to other Romance
pro-drop languages. Finally, we believe that our
ML approach could be improved as it is the first
attempt of this kind.

While the identification of explicit and zero subjects has attracted the attention of researchers in the past, the automatic identification of impersonal constructions in Spanish has not been addressed yet and this work is the first such study. In this paper we present a corpus to underpin research on the automatic detection of these linguistic phenomena in Spanish and a novel machine learning-based methodology for their computational treatment. This study also provides an analysis of the features, discusses performance across two different genres and offers error analysis.

Machine learning methods are known to perform better than rule-based techniques for identifying non-referential expressions (Boyd et al., 2005). However, there is some debate as to which approach may be optimal in anaphora resolution systems (Mitkov and Hallett, 2007). Both English and French texts use an explicit word, with some grammatical information (a third person pronoun), which is non-referential (Mitkov, 2010). By contrast, in Spanish, nonreferential expressions are not realized by expletive or pleonastic pronouns but rather by a certai</context>

The Ferrandez and Peral algorithm (2000) outperforms the (Rello and Illisei, 2009b) approach with 57% accuracy in identifying zero subjects.

Both English and French texts use an explicit word, with some grammatical information (a third person pronoun), which is non-referential (Mitkov, 2010). By contrast, in Spanish, nonreferential expressions are not realized by expletive or pleonastic pronouns but rather by a certain kind of ellipsis. For this reason, it is easy to mistake them for zero pronouns, which are, in fact, referential. Previous work on detecting Spanish subject ellipsis focused on distinguishing verbs with explicit subjects and verbs with zero subjects (zero pronouns), using rule-based methods (Ferrandez and Peral, 2000; Rello and Illisei, 2009b). The Ferrandez and Peral algorithm (2000) outperforms the (Rello and Illisei, 2009b) approach with 57% accuracy in identifying zero subjects. In (Ferrandez and Peral, 2000), the implementation of a zero subject identification and resolution module forms part of an anaphora resolution system. ML based studies on the identification of explicit non-referential constructions in English present accuracies of 71% (Evans, 2001), 87.5% (Bergsma et al., 2008) and 88% (Boyd et al., 2005), while 97.5% is achieved for French (Danlos, 2005).

The corpus is named after its annotated content Explicit Subjects, Zero Subjects and Impersonal Constructions (ESZIC es Corpus). To the best of our knowledge, the existing corpora annotated with elliptical subjects belong to other genres. The Blue Book (handbook) and Lexesp (journalistic texts) used in (Ferrandez and Peral, 2000) contain zero subjects but not impersonal constructions. On the other hand, the Spanish AnCora corpus based on journalistic texts includes zero pronouns and impersonal constructions (Recasens and Mart, 2010) while the Zcorpus (Rello and Illisei, 2009b) comprises legal, instructional and encyclopedic texts but has no annotated impersonal constructions. The ESZIC corpus contains a total of 6,827 verbs including 1,793 zero subjects.

Other approaches have employed various classification algorithms, including JRip in WEKA (Muller, 2006), with precision of 74% and recall of 60%, and K-nearest neighbors in TiMBL: both in (Evans, 2001) with precision of 73% and recall of 69%, and in (Boyd et al., 2005) with precision of 82% and recall of 71%. Since there is no previous ML approach for this task in Spanish, our baselines for the explicit subjects and the zero subjects are the parser output and the previous rule-based work with the highest performance (Ferrandez and Peral, 2000). For the impersonal constructions the baseline is a simple greedy algorithm that classifies as an impersonal construction every verb whose lemma is categorized as a verb with impersonal use according to the RAE dictionary (Real Academia Espanola, 2001). Our method outperforms the Connexor parser which identifies the explicit subjects but makes no distinction between zero subjects and impersonal constructions.

It outperforms current approaches in explicit subject detection and impersonal constructions, doing better than the parser for every 5 ESZIC es Corpus is available at: http: //luzrello.com/Projects.html. class. A possible future avenue to explore could be to combine our approach with Ferrandez and Peral (Ferrandez and Peral, 2000) by employing both algorithms in sequence: first Ferrandez and Perals algorithm to detect all zero subjects and then ours to identify explicit subjects and impersonals. Assuming that the same accuracy could be maintained, on our data set the combined performance could potentially be in the range of 95%. Future research goals are the extrinsic evaluation of our system by integrating our system in NLP tasks and its adaptation to other Romance pro-drop languages.

The necessity of identifying such kind of elliptical constructions has been specifically highlighted in work about Spanish zero pronouns (Ferrandez and Peral, 2000) and co-reference resolution (Recasens and Hovy, 2009). The main contributions of this study are: A public annotated corpus in Spanish to compare different strategies for detecting explicit subjects, zero subjects and impersonal constructions. The first ML based approach to this problem in Spanish and a thorough analysis regarding features, learnability, genre and errors. The best performing algorithms to automatically detect explicit subjects and impersonal constructions in Spanish. The remainder of the paper is organized as follows. Section 2 describes the classes of Spanish subjects, while Section 3 provides a literature review. Section 4 desc</context>

For this reason, it is easy to mistake them for zero pronouns, which are, in fact, referential. Previous work on detecting Spanish subject ellipsis focused on distinguishing verbs with explicit subjects and verbs with zero subjects (zero pronouns), using rule-based methods (Ferrandez and Peral, 2000; Rello and Illisei, 2009b).

These results reveal that the health texts are the most heterogeneous ones. In fact, we also found subsets of the legal documents where our method achieves an accuracy of 94.6%, implying more homogeneous texts. 6.4 Error Analysis Since the features of the system are linguistically motivated, we performed a linguistic analysis of the erroneously classified instances to find out which patterns are more difficult to classify and which type of information would improve the method (Rello et al., 2011). We extract the erroneously classified instances of our training data and classify the errors. According to the distribution of the errors per class (Table 8) we take into account the following four classes of errors for the analysis: (a) impersonal constructions classified as zero subjects, (b) impersonal constructions classified as explicit subjects, (c) zero subjects classified as explicit subjects, and (d) explicit subjects classified as zero subjects. The diagonal numbers are the true predicted cases. The classification of impersonal constructions is less balanced than the ones for expli</context>

The linguistically motivated features are inspired by previous ML approaches in Chinese (Zhao and Ng, 2007) and English (Evans, 2001). The values for the features (see Table 4) were derived from information provided both by Connexors Machinese Syntax parser and a set of lists. We can describe each of the features as broadly belonging to one of ten classes, as follows: 1 PARSER: the presence or absence of a subject in the clause, as identified by the parser. We are not aware of a formal evaluation of Connexors accuracy.
