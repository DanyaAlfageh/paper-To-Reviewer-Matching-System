As for test data, we used the ICWSM 2009 Spinn3r Blog Dataset CITATION, which was collected during the summer of 2008, coinciding with the build-up for the 2008 Presidential Elections in the US.,,
Both the blogs and the Wikipedia articles were tagged using the Stanford Named Entity Recognizer CITATION, which labels the entities according to these types: Time, Location, Organization, Person, Money, Percent, Date, and Miscellaneous.,,
We performed all our tests using the Weka suite CITATION, and we tested the following classifiers.,,
introduced by CITATION in 2009 in their paper on relation extraction.,,
CITATION use distant supervision to label the sentiment associated with Twitter posts.,,
They found their approach to be around 78-83% accurate using several different machine learning techniques CITATION.,,
SVMs are often used successfully in text classification problems (CITATION; CITATION; CITATION).,,
ing the Stanford Named Entity Recognizer CITATION, which labels the entities according to these types: Time, Location, Organization, Person, Money, Percent, Date, and Miscellaneous.,,
We performed all our tests using the Weka suite CITATION, and we tested the following classifiers.,,
The first was the Naive Bayes CITATION (NB for short), which has been successfully applied to text classification problems CITATION.,,
A variation of the NB classifier, called Naive Bayes Multinomial (NBM) CITATION, was also tested, as it was shown to perform better for text classification tasks in which the vocabulary is large (as in our case).,,
A work which looks at true topic classification of blogs, as is being done here, is that of CITATION, who use a domain dictionary to classify blog posts without machine learning (i.e., using a rule-based system).,,
is (LDA), Latent Semantic Analysis (LSA) and Latent Semantic Indexing (LSI) CITATION.,,
CITATION discussed the classification of blog authors by gender and age.,,

CITATION consider using a universal data set to train a classifier for web data similar to blogs .,,
