A further 113,346,430 tokens (4,566,241 sentences) of raw data from the Wall Street Journal section of the North American News Corpus CITATION were parsed to produce the training data for adaptation,,
The C&C supertagger is similar to the CITATION tagger, using features based on words and POS tags in a five-word window surrounding the target word, and defining a local probability distribution over supertags for each word in the sentence, given the previous two supertags,,
5 Evaluation We used the hybrid parsing model described in CITATION, and the Viterbi decoder to find the highest-scoring derivation,,
CITATION applied co-training to LTAG parsing, in which the supertagger and parser provide the two views,,
We do not use global tagging models as in CITATION or Collins (2002),,
As gold standard data for supertagger evaluation we have used supertagged GENIA data CITATION, annotated by CITATION,,
Supertagging has since been effectively applied to other formalisms, such as HPSG (CITATION; CITATION), and as an information source for tasks such as Statistical Machine Translation CITATION,,
For parsing evaluation, grammatical relations from the BioInfer corpus were used CITATION, with the Source Sentence Length Corpus % Range Average Variance 0-4 3.26 0.64 1.2 5-20 14.04 17.41 39.2 News 21-40 28.76 ,,
distributional similarity CITATION and question answering CITATION, large volumes of text and detailed syntactic information are both critical for high performance,,
For parser evaluation, three hundred of these sentences were manually annotated with DepBank grammatical relations CITATION in the style of CITATION,,
For adaptive training we have used 1,900,618,859 tokens (76,739,723 sentences) from the MEDLINE abstracts tokenised by CITATION,,
Since most sentences are parsed at the first level (in which the average number of supertags assigned to each word is only slightly greater than one), this provides some of the speed benefit of single tagging, but without loss of coverage CITATION,,
6.1 Newswire speed improvement In our first experiment, we trained supertagger models using Generalised Iterative Scaling (GIS) CITATION, the limited memory BFGS method (BFGS) CITATION, the averaged perceptron CITATION, and the margin infused relaxed algorithm (MIRA) CITATION,,
The use of parser output for supertagger training has been explored for LTAG by CITATION,,

same post-processing process as CITATION to convert the C&C parser output to Stanford format grammatical relations (de Marneffe et al., 2006),,
CITATION were unable to improve the accuracy of POS tagging using self-training,,
cal model is considerably lower than that reported by CITATION,,
4.1 Training and accuracy evaluation We have used Sections 02-21 of CCGbank CITATION, the CCG version of the Penn Treebank CITATION, as training data for the newspaper domain,,
CITATION improved the accuracy of a parsing pipeline by using the output of later stages to constrain earlier stages,,
red of these sentences were manually annotated with DepBank grammatical relations CITATION in the style of CITATION,,
To check whether changes were statistically significant we applied the test described by CITATION,,
Another method is to use a re-ranker CITATION on the output of a system to generate new training data,,
For parsing evaluation, grammatical relations from the BioInfer corpus were used CITATION, with the Source Sentence Length Corpus % Range Average Variance 0-4 3.26 0.64 ,,
CCG supertaggers are about 92% accurate when assigning a single lexical category to each word CITATION,,
6.4 Cross-domain speed improvement When applying parsers out of domain they are typically slower and less accurate CITATION,,
CITATION applied supertagging to CCG, using a flexible multi-tagging approach,,
In contrast, CITATIONa) report improved accuracy through self-training for a twostage parser and re-ranker,,
These sentences were POS-tagged and parsed twice, once as for the newswire and Wikipedia data, and then again, using the bio-specific models developed by CITATION,,
Previous work has shown that parsers typically perform poorly outside of their training domain CITATION,,
In this paper, we focus on the CCG parser and supertagger described in CITATION,,
This method has been used effectively to improve parsing performance on newspaper text (CITATIONa), as well as adapting a Penn Treebank parser to a new domain (CITATIONb),,
CITATION call supertagging almost parsing because of the significant reduction in ambiguity which occurs once the supertags have been assigned,,
Supertaggers can be made accurate enough for wide coverage parsing using multi-tagging CITATION, in which more than one supertag can be assigned to a word; however, as more supertags are supplied by the supertagger, parsing efficiency decreases CITATION, demonstrating the influence of lexical ambiguity on parsing complexity CITATION,,
