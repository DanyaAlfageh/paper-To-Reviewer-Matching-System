The only works on Englishto-Arabic SMT that we are aware of are CITATION, and CITATION,,
We use the Morphological Analyzer MADA CITATION to decompose the Arabic source,,
90 \x0cThe English source is aligned to the segmented Arabic target using the standard MOSES CITATION configuration of GIZA++ (,,
CITATION propose Factored Translation Models, which extend phrase-based statistical machine translation by allowing the integration of additional morphological features at the word level,,
CITATION) that morphological segmentation of Arabic improves the translation performance for both Arabic-to-English and English-to-Arabic by addressing the problem of sparsity of the Arabic side,,
5 Experiments 5.1 System description For the English source, we first tokenize using the Stanford Log-linear Part-of-Speech Tagger CITATION,,
Similarly, for Arabic-to-English, CITATION, and CITATION show that various segmentation schemes lead to improvements that decrease with increasing parallel corpus size.,,
4 Preprocessing Techniques 4.1 Arabic Segmentation and Recombination It has been shown previously work (CITATION; CITATION) that morphological segment,,
We parse the data using the Collins Parser CITATION, and then tag person, location and organization names using the Stanford Named Entity Recognizer CITATION,,
We then proceed to split the data into smaller sentences and tag them using Ratnaparkhis Maximum Entropy Tagger CITATION,,
CITATION automatically learns syntactic reordering rules that are then applied to the Arabic side of the parallel corpora,,
Much like CITATION, we parse the English side of our corpora and reorder using predefined rules,,
4 Preprocessing Techniques 4.1 Arabic Segmentation and Recombination It has been shown previously work (CITATION; CITATION) that morphological segmentation of Arabic improves the translation performance for both Arabic-to-English and English-to-Arabic by addressing the problem of sparsity of the Arabic side,,
Similarly, for Arabic-to-English, CITATION, and CITATION show that various segmentation schemes lead to improvements that decrease with increasing parallel corpus size,,
CITATION use similar methods to reorder German by looking at the POS tags for German-to-English and German-toSpanish,,
It has been noted in previous work CITATION that syntactic reordering does not improve translation if the parse quality is not good enough,,
CITATION enrich the English side by adding a feature to the Factored Model that models noun case agreement and verb person conjugation, and show that it leads t,,
Similarly, for Arabic-to-English, CITATION, and CITATION show that various segmentation schemes lead to improvements that decrease with in,,
rk CITATION that syntactic reordering does not improve translation if the parse quality is not good enough,,
CITATION present a similar approach, with a notable difference: the re-ordering rules are automatically learned from aligning parse trees for both the source and target sentences,,
90 \x0cThe English source is aligned to the segmented Arabic target using the standard MOSES CITATION configuration of GIZA++ CITATION, which is IBM Model 4, and decoding is done using the phrasebased SMT system MOSES,,
CITATION enrich the English side by adding a feature to the Factored Model that models noun case agreement and verb person conjugation, and show that it leads to a more grammatically correct output for English-to-Greek and English-to-Czech translation,,
We use the Morphological Analyzer MADA (CITATION,,
We tune using Ochs algorithm CITATION to optimize weights for the distortion model, language model, phrase translation model and word penalty over the BLEU metric CITATION,,
e segmented Arabic target using the standard MOSES CITATION configuration of GIZA++ CITATION, which is IBM Model 4, and decoding is done using the phrasebased SMT system MOSES,,
Morphological segmentation has been shown to benefit Arabic-to-English CITATION and English-to-Arabic CITATION translation, although the gains tend to decrease with increasing training data size,,
mum Entropy Tagger CITATION,,
It has been successfully applied to German-toEnglish and Chinese-to-English SMT (CITATION; CITATION),,
Most relevant to the approach in this paper are CITATION and CITATION,,
90 \x0cThe English source is aligned to the segmented Arabic target using the standard MOSES CITATION configuration of GIZA++ CITATION, which is IBM Model 4, and decoding is do,,
They use a trigram language model and the Arabic morphological analyzer MADA CITATION respectively, to segment the Arabic side of their corpora,,
