Nevertheless, CITATION report that 5% of the sentence pairs in an aligned parallel ChineseEnglish corpus containe,,
The first point is motivated by studies such as CITATION and simply reflects that in order to induce multiword translation units in this kind of synchronous grammars, it is useful to be able to introduce multiple terminals simultaneously,,
CITATION present the only work to our knowledge on using RCGs for translation,,
Range concatenation grammars (RCG) CITATION mainly attracted attention in the formal language community, since they recognize exactly the polynomial time recognizable languages, but recently they have been argued to be useful for data-driven parsing too CITATION,,
Theorem 1.2 (CITATION),,
Inside-out alignments (Wu, 1997), such as the one in Example 1.3, cannot be induced by any of these theories; in fact, there seems to be no useful synchronous grammar formalisms available that handle inside-out alignments, with the possible exceptions of synchronous tree-adjoining grammars CITATION, CITATION and generalized multitext grammar,,
Both CITATION and Maier and Sgaard (2008), however, only make use of so-called simple RCGs, known to be equivalent to linear context-free rewrite systems (LCFRSs) (CITATION; CITATION),,
1 (2,2)-BRCGs and ITGs (2,2)-BRCGs are positive RCGs CITATION with binary start predicate names, i.e,,
ITGs translate into simple (2,2)-BRCGs in the following way; see CITATION for a definition of ITGs,,
Inside-out alignments (Wu, 1997), such as the one in Example 1.3, cannot be induced by any of these theories; in fact, there seems to be no useful synchronous grammar formalisms available that handle inside-out alignments, with the possible exceptions of synchronous tree-adjoining grammars CITATION, CITATION and generalized multitext grammars CITATION, which are all way more complex than ITG, STSG and (2,2)-BRCG,,
-potsdam.de Abstract Positive and bottom-up non-erasing binary range concatenation grammars CITATION with at most binary predicates ((2,2)-BRCGs) is a O(|G|n6) time strict extension of inversion transduction grammars (Wu, 1997) (ITGs),,
2 Alignment capacity CITATION identify a class of alignment structures that cannot be induced by ITGs, but that can be induced by a number of similar synchronous grammar formalisms, e.g,,
It modifies the original CYK algorithm CITATION in four ways: (i) It uses two charts; one for the source string (s) and one for the target string (t),,
synchronous tree substitution grammar (STSG) CITATION,,
Nevertheless, CITATION report that 5% of the sentence pairs in an aligned parallel ChineseEnglish corpus contained inside-out alignments,,
