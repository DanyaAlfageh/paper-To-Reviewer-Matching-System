For example, CITATION point out that TAG does not have the generative capacity to model certain kinds of scrambling in German, when the so-called cooccurrence constraint is imposed, requiring the \x0cderivational pairing between verbs and their complements.,,

Next, we prove that in GMTG each component grammar retains its generative power, a requirement for synchronous formalisms that CITATION called the weak language preservation property.,,
Lastly, we propose a synchronous generalization of Chomsky Normal Form, which lays the groundwork for synchronous parsing under GMTG using a CKYstyle algorithm (CITATION; CITATION).,,
