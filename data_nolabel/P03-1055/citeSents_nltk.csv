Following the annotation guidelines CITATION, we distinguish seven basic types of EEs: controlled NP-traces (NP), PROs (PRO), traces of A -movement (mostly wh-movement: WH), empty complementizers (COMP), empty units (UNIT), and traces representing pseudo-attachments (shared constituents, discontinuous dependencies, etc.,,

controlled NP-traces (NPNP), we follow the standard technique of marking nodes dominating the empty element up to but not including the parent of the antecedent as defective (missing an argument) with a gap feature (CITATION; CITATION).1 Furthermore, to make antecedent co-indexation possible with many types of EEs, we generalize Collins approach by enriching the annotation of non-terminals with the type of the EE in question (eg.,,

Furthermore, to ease straightforward comparison with previous work CITATION, a new label CLAUSE is introduced for COMP-SBAR whenever it is followed by a moved clause WHS.,,
