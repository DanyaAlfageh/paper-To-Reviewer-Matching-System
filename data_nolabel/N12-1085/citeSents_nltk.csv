Because of a dearth of resources for this fine-grained task, we also develop new crowdsourcing techniques for labeling word-level, syntactically informed sen1 CITATION recently argued that work on sentiment analysis needs to de-emphasize the goal of building systems that are high-performing by traditional measures, because the field risks sacrificing opportunities that may lead to a more thorough understanding of language uses and users in relation to subjective phenomena.,,
1 Introduction The terms sentiment analysis and opinion mining cover a wide body of research on and development of systems that can automatically infer emotional states from text (after CITATION we use the two names interchangeably).,,
Sentiment analysis plays a large role in business, politics, and is itself a vibrant research area CITATION.,,
Fine-grained sentiment analysis requires identifying the sources and targets directly relevant to sentiment bearing expressions CITATION.,,
Existing work in this area often uses semantic frames and role labeling (CITATION; CITATION), but resources typically used in these tasks (e.g.,,
More general approaches CITATION describe semantic and discourse contexts of opinion sources and targets cannot recognize them.,,
Some work of this 668 \x0cnature merely identifies targets without providing the syntactic evidence necessary to find domain-relevant opinionated language CITATION, relying on lists of opinion keywords.,,
While there are many approaches for inference in statistical models, we turn to MCMC methods CITATION to discover the underlying structure of the model.,,
More specifically, we seek a posterior distribution over latent variables parent node child1 child2 child3 h g f Figure 3: Graphical model of SRT factors that partition words in a sentence into flow and inert groups; we estimate this posterior using Gibbs sampling CITATION.,,
5.2 Crowdsourced annotation process Our process for obtaining gold standard data involves multiple levels of human annotation including on crowdsourcing platforms CITATION.,,
The most recent target identification techniques use machine learning to determine the presence of a target from known opinionated language CITATION.,,

More general approaches CITATION describe semantic and discourse contexts of opinion sources and targets cannot recognize them.,,
Some work of this 668 \x0cnature merely identifies targets without providing the syntactic evidence necessary to find domain-relevant opinionated language CITATION, relying on lists of opinion keywords.,,
There is also work CITATION that uses predefined heuristics over dependency parses to identify both targets and opinion keywords but does not acquire new syntactic heuristics.,,
Other work CITATION is similar to ours in that it uses factor graph modeling over a dependency parse formalism, but it assumes that opinionated language is known a priori and focuses on polarity classification, while our work tackles the more fundamental problem of identifying the opinionated language itself.,,
This is accomplished via the sample-rank algorithm CITATION.,,
Sentiment corpora with sub-sentential annotations, such as the Multi-Perspective Question-Answering (MPQA) corpus CITATION and the J. D. Power and Associates (JDPA) blog post corpus CITATION, exist, but most of these annotations are at a phrase level.,,
We describe these briefly here; more information about the development of the data source can be found in CITATION.,,
This means that we are actually searching for all triples {source, target, opinion} in this sentence CITATION and throughout each document in the corpus.,,
Providing such fine-grained annotations would enrich information extraction, question answering, and corpus exploration applications by letting users see who is saying what with what opinion (CITATION; CITATION).,,

4.1 Sampling labels A factor graph CITATION is a representation of a joint probability distribution in the form of a graph with two types of vertices: variable vertices and factor vertices.,,
3 Syntactic relatedness tries We now describe how we build the syntactic relatedness trie (SRT) that forms the scaffolding for the probabilistic models needed to identify sentiment-bearing words via syntactic constraints extracted from a dependency parse CITATION.,,
This was implemented by changing the proposal distribution used by the FACTORIE framework CITATION.,,

In addition to being theoretically sound a lacuna identified in many sentiment systems1 such approaches improve downstream sentiment tasks CITATION.,,
For example, the IT business press data that we use in this work belongs to a larger research program (CITATION; CITATION) of exploring industry opinion leadership.,,
Other work CITATION is similar to ours in that it uses factor graph modeling over a dependency parse formalism, but it assumes that opinionated language is known a priori and focuses on polarity classification, while our work tackles the more fundamental problem of identifying the opinionated language itself.,,
This dearth persists despite evidence that such information improves sentiment analysis CITATION.,,
