4 An adaptation of the averaged perceptron algorithm CITATION is used to tune the model parameters,,
First, we analyze the Microsoft Research (MSR) manual word alignments CITATION for the RTE2 dataset (BarHaim et al., 2006), shedding light on the relationship between alignments and multi-word expressions,,
An alternative approach to paraphrase acquisition was proposed by CITATION,,
Called a pain in the neck for NLP, they have received considerable attention in recent years and it has been suggested that proper treatment could make a significant difference in various NLP tasks CITATION,,
In addition, an alignment-based approach has the advantage of generality: Almost all existing RTE models align the linguistic material of the premise 1 \x0cand hypothesis and base at least part of their decision on properties of this alignment (CITATION; CITATION; CITATION; CITATION),,
Such similarities are not present in standard lexical resources like WordNet or Dekang Lins thesaurus CITATION,,
This paper investigates the impact of MWEs on the recognition of textual entailment (RTE) task CITATION,,
CITATIONs DIRT model collects lexicalized dependency paths with two slots at either end,,
 CITATION,,
Our results may seem to contradict the results of many previous RTE studies such as CITATION which found paraphrases to make an important contribution,,
A number of papers have suggested that paraphrase knowledge plays a very important role (CITATION; CITATION; CITATION),,
The criteria we use for MWE categorization are different from the ones adopted by CITATION,,
Other work on RTE has targeted specifically this observation and has described paraphrases on a dependency level (CITATION; CITATION),,
One prominent constraint of the IBM word alignment models CITATION is functional alignment, that is each target word is mapped onto at most one source word,,
CITATION for details),,
