Semantic Roles Semantic roles are one of the oldest classes of constructs in linguistic theory, dating back thousands of years to Paninis karaka theory (CITATION; CITATION; CITATION).,,
The opposite end of the spectrum consists of theories with only two proto-roles or macroroles: Proto-Agent and Proto-Patient (Van Valin 1993; CITATION).,,
In between lie many theories with approximately 10 roles, such as Fillmores (1971) list of nine: Agent, Experiencer, Instrument, Object, Source, Goal, Location, Time, and Path.1 1 There are scores of other theories with slightly different sets of roles, including those of CITATION, CITATION, and CITATION; see CITATION for an excellent summary.,,
For example, in the context of the Air Traveler Information System (ATIS) for spoken dialogue, CITATION computed the probability that a constituent such as Atlanta filled a semantic slot such as Destination in a semantic frame for air travel.,,
In a data-driven approach to information extraction, CITATION builds a dictionary of patterns for filling slots in a specific domain such as terrorist attacks, and Riloff and Schmelzenbach CITATION extend this technique to derive automatically entire case frames for words in the domain.,,

Systems for studying mergers and acquisitions use slots like products, relationship, joint venture company, and amount CITATION.,,
These roles are defined at the level of semantic frames of the type introduced by CITATION, which describe abstract actions or relationships, along with their participants.,,
A frame is a schematic representation of situations involving various participants, props, and other conceptual roles CITATION.,,
One way of thinking about traditional abstract thematic roles, such as Agent and Patient, in the context of FrameNet is to conceive them as frame elements defined by abstract frames, such as action and motion, at the top of an inheritance hierarchy of semantic frames CITATION.,,
or example, CITATION and others have shown that the different syntactic subcategorization frames of a verb such as serve can be used to help disambiguate a particular instance of the word.,,
Semantic roles could also act as an important intermediate representation in statistical machine translation or automatic text summarization and in the emerging field of text data mining (TDM) CITATION.,,
Systems for booking airplane information use domain-specific frames with slots like orig city, dest city, or depart time CITATION.,,

Our statistical algorithms are trained on a hand-labeled data set: the FrameNet database (Baker, Fillmore, and Lowe 1998; CITATION).,,
We outline the process here; for more detail see CITATION.,,

s such as Head-Driven Phrase Structure Grammar (HPSG) CITATION, rely on hand-developed grammars that must anticipate each way in which semantic roles may be realized syntactically.,,

But the challenges that lie ahead are still similar to the challenge that the field has faced since CITATION: moving away from carefully hand-crafted, domaindependent systems toward robustness and domain independence.,,
