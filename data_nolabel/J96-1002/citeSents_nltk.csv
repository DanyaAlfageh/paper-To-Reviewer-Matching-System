We present here a version of this algorithm specifically designed for the problem at hand; a proof of the monotonicity and convergence of the algorithm is given in Della CITATION.,,
It also includes the part-of-speech tags for these words, and the classes of these words as derived from a mutual-information clustering scheme described in CITATION.,,

Adopting the least complex hypothesis possible is embodied in Occam\'s razor (&quot;Nunquam ponenda est pluralitas sine necesitate.\') and even appears earlier, in the Bible and the writings of Herotodus CITATION.,,
Laplace might justly be considered the father of maximum entropy, having enunciated the underlying theme 200 years ago in his &quot;Principle of Insufficient Reason:&quot; when one has no information to distinguish between the probability of two events, the best strategy is to consider them equally likely CITATION.,,
As E. T. Jaynes, a more recent pioneer of maximum entropy, put it CITATION: ... the fact that a certain probability distribution maximizes entropy subject to certain constraints representing our incomplete information, is the fundamental property which justifies use of that distribution for inference; it agrees with everything that is known, but carefully avoids assuming anything that is not known.,,
