CITATION demonstrated that word-category pairs extracted from the d,,
CITATION proposes a disambiguation approach based on vector space model for linking ambiguous menti,,
The experiments results show that, in entity linking task, our name variation method outperforms the method of CITATION for both entity disambiguation methods,,
In our implementation, we use the binary SVMLight developed by CITATION,,
 Bag of Words feature in Web People Search, CITATION illustrated that noun phrase and n-grams longer than 2 were not effective in comparison with tokenbased features and using bi-grams gives the best 1294 \x0cresults only reaching recall 0.7,,
We obtain useful information from Wikipedia by the tool named Java Wikipedia Library2 CITATION, which allows to access all information contained in Wikipedia,,
CITATION use Wikipedia to construct their training data by utilizing,,
2009) and NLPR_KBP1 CITATION use similarity ranking approach; Stanford_UBC2 (Agirre et al,,
For Bag of Words feature in Web People Search, CITATION illustrated that noun phrase and n-grams longer than 2 were not effective in comparison with tokenbased features and using bi-grams gives the best 1294 \x0cresults only reaching recall 0.7,,
We set the window size to 55, which is the value that was observed to give optimum performance for the disambiguation problem CITATION,,
CITATION rank the candidates based on BOW and Wikipedia semantic knowledge similarity,,
CITATION rank the entity candidates using a search engine,,
Name Variation Approaches Ranking Method Our Disambiguation Method CITATION 60.9 82.2 +DYM+SE 61.9 83.8 Table 2: Entity Linking Result for two name variation approaches,,
Given a knowledge base, a document collection, entity linking task as defined by KBP-091 CITATION is to determine for each name string and the document it appears, which knowledge base entity is being referred to, or if the entity is a new entity which is not present in the reference KB,,
CITATION train their models on a small manually created data set containing only 1,615 examples,,
For example, to capture the category information, the method of CITATION involves a complicated optimization issue and the approach has to be simplified for feasible computation, which compromises the accuracy,,
We conduct some experiments to compare our name variation method using Algorithm 1 in Section 3.1 with the name variation method of CITATION,,
Compared with baseline system using CITATION name variation method in Table 2, in total our proposed method achieves a significant 22.9% improvement,,
CITATION extracts the name variations of an entity by leveraging four knowledge sources in Wikipedia: entity pages, disambiguation pages redirect pages and anchor text,,
Using these four sources above, we extracted name variations for every entity in KB to form the Knowledge Repository as Cucerzans CITATION method,,
Given a knowledge base, a document collection, entity linking task as defined by KBP-091 CITATION is to determine for each name string and the document it appears, which knowledge base entity is being referred to, or if the entity is a new entity whic,,
CITATION demonstrated that word-category pairs extracted from the document and Wikipedia article are a good signal for disambiguation,,
CITATION refer the mentions in a document to KIM (Popov et al,,
So we propose to use two more sources Did You Mean and Wikipedia Search Engine when CITATION algorithm returns empty candidate set,,
CITATION report a disambiguation algorithm for geography,,
CITATION proposes a disambiguation approach based on vector space model for linking ambiguous mention in a document with one entity in Wikipedia,,
For pre-processing, we perform sentence boundary detection and Chunking derived from Stanford parser CITATION, Named Entity Recognition using a SVM based system trained and tested on ACE 2005 with 92.5(P) 84.3(R) 88.2(F), and coreference resolution using a SVM based coreference resolver trained and tested on ACE 2005 with 79.5%(P), 66.7%(R) and 72.5%(F),,
Both Web People Search (WePS) task CITATION and Global Entity Detection & Recognition task (GEDR) in Automatic Content Extraction 2008 (ACE08) disambiguate entity mentions by clustering documents with these mentions,,
