CITATION describe a statistical system trained on the data from the FrameNet project to automatically assign semantic roles,,
The Propbank project at the University of Pennsylvania CITATION and the FrameNet project at the International Computer Science Institute (Baker et al., 1998) share the goal of documenting the syntactic realization of arguments of the predicates of the general English lexicon by annotating a corpus with semantic roles,,
3 The Experiments In previous work using the FrameNet corpus, CITATION developed a system to predict semantic roles from sentences and their parse trees as determined by the statistical parser of CITATION,,
The Propbank project at the University of Pennsylvania CITATION and the FrameNet project at the International Computer Scien,,
A more complete description of the FrameNet project can be found in (Baker et al., 1998; CITATION), and the rami\x0ccations for automatic classi\x0ccation are discussed more thoroughly in CITATION,,
5 Conclusion Our chunk-based system takes the last word of the chunk as its head word for the purposes of predicting roles, but does not make use of the identities of the chunk\'s other words or the intervening words between a chunk and the predicate, unlike Hidden Markov Model-like systems such as CITATION, CITATION and La\x0berty et al,,
Of the systems evaluated for the Message Understanding Conference task, CITATION made use of an integrated syntactic and semantic model producing a full parse tree, and achieved results comparable to other systems that did not make use of a complete parse,,
"Among such systems, (Hobbs et al., 1997) built \x0cnite-state recognizers for various entities, which were then cascaded to form recognizers for higher-level relations, while CITATION used low-level \\chunks"" from a general-purpose syntactic analyzer as observations in a trained Hidden Markov Model,,"
In this paper, we examine how the information provided by modern statistical parsers such as CITATION and CITATION contributes to solving this problem,,
Our chunks were derived from the Treebank trees using the conversion described by Tjong Kim CITATION,,

FrameNet is focused on semantic frames, which are de\x0cned as schematic representation of situations involving various participants, props, and other conceptual roles CITATION,,
