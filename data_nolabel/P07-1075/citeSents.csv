Since clauses in a sentence are connected by clausal relations CITATION, it is thus important to perform discourse analysis of a sentence,,
However, CITATION reported that the increase of relation path length will lead to considerable decrease in performance,,
Second, CITATION stated that entities in subordinate clauses are less salient,,
onstructions such as X conducted an attack on Y under the verb frame attack CITATION,,
CITATION classified relation path between candidate entities into simple, average and hard cases,,
Third, the knowledge of textual structure helps to interpret the meaning of entities in a text CITATION,,
However, current semantic parsers such as the ASSERT are not able to recognize support verb constructions such as X conducted an attack on Y under the verb frame attack CITATION,,
3 Motivation for using discourse relations Our method is based on Rhetorical Structure Theory (RST) by CITATION,,
CITATION employed a discourse-based analysis for IE,,
CITATION reported that discourse structure helps to extract anaphoric relations,,
Previous approaches to IE relied on cooccurrence CITATION and dependency CITATION relations between entities,,
First, CITATION reported that discourse analysis helps to decompose long sentences into clauses,,
CITATION applied semantic parsing to capture the predicate-argument sentence structure,,
