2.2 The Model In previous work using the PropBank corpus, CITATION proposed a model predicting argument roles using the same statistical method as the one employed by CITATION for predicting semantic roles based on the FrameNet corpus CITATION,,
The IE architecture in Figure 7(a) may be compared with the IE architecture with cascaded FSA represented in Figure 7(b) and reported in CITATION,,
2.3 The Experiments The results presented in this paper were obtained by training on Proposition Bank (PropBank) release 2002/7/15 CITATION,,
In this paper we describe a domain-independent IE paradigm that is based on predicate-argument structures identified automatically by two different methods: (1) the statistical method reported in CITATION; and (2) a new method based on inductive learning which obtains 17% higher Fscore over the first method when tested on the same data,,
At last, the dependency parser presented in CITATION is used to generate the full parse,,
In this context, the purpose of the HUB Event-99 evaluations CITATION was to capture information on some newsworthy classes of events, e.g,,
To process texts efficiently and fast, domain patterns are ideally implemented as finite state automata (FSAs), a methodology pioneered in the FASTUS IE system CITATION,,
CITATION report the results listed on the first line of Table 2,,
This statistical technique of labeling predicate argument operates on the output of the probabilistic parser reported \x0cin CITATION,,
To achieve high accuracy and resolve the data sparsity problem the method reported in (CITATION; CITATION) employed a backoff solution based on a lattice that combines the model features,,
The set of syntactic frames are determined by diathesis alternations, as defined in CITATION,,
Decision tree learning provided by C5 CITATION has built in support for boosting,,
For example, the backoff lattice in CITATION consists of eight connected nodes for a five-feature set,,
For this reason we used the C5 inductive decision tree learning algorithm CITATION to implement both the classifier that identifies argument constituents and the classifier that labels arguments with their roles,,
The PropBank annotations, performed at University of Pennsylvania (www.cis.upenn.edu/ ace) were described in CITATION,,

The statistical model introduced in CITATION uses predicate lexical information at most levels in the probability lattice, hence its scalability to unknown predicates is limited,,
Our model considers two sets of features: Feature Set 1 (FS1): features used in the work reported in CITATION and CITATION ; and Feature Set 2 (FS2): a novel set of features introduced in this paper,,
The full parser first performs part-of-speech (POS) tagging using transformation based learning (TBL) CITATION,,
CITATION,,
Then non-recursive, or basic, noun phrases (NPB) are identified using the TBL method reported in CITATION,,
One such augmented parser, trained on data available from the PropBank project has been recently presented in CITATION,,
