Best known is the work of Della CITATION, the Improved Iterative Scaling (IIS) algorithm,,
We only know of one limited experiment comparing IIS to GIS CITATION,,
For such applications, the array s[j, y] would be of a size at least 5000 times the number of training instances: clearly impractical (but see below for 2 CITATION use an algorithm that might appear sequential, butanexaminationofthedefinitionoff# andrelated work shows that it is not,,

CITATION describe GIS for joint proba,,
These techniques include unigram caching, cluster expansion (Lafferty et al., 2001; CITATION), and word clustering CITATION,,
CITATION describe GIS for joint probabilities, and mention a fast variation, which appears to have been missed by the conditional maxent community,,

As shown by CITATION, boosting is in some ways a sequential version of maxent,,
There has been interesting recent unpublished work by CITATION,,
Also, one of the first and best known uses of conditional maxent models is for language modeling CITATION, where the number of output classesisthevocabularysize, typically5,000-60,000 words,,
CITATION describes Iterative Scaling (IS), applied to joint probabilities, and CITATION, page 235) shows how to apply IS to conditional probabilities,,
Unfortunately, although maximum entropy (maxent) models can be applied very generally, the typical training algorithm for maxent, Generalized Iterative Scaling (GIS) CITATION, can be extremely slow,,
CITATION describe a technique for smoothing maximum entropy that is the best currently known,,
Best known is the work of Della CITATION, ,,
For convergence proofs, see CITATION, who prove convergence of the algorithm for joint models,,
Also, with SCGIS, it is clear how to apply other improvements such as the smoothing technique of CITATION,,
Chen and Rosenfeld describe a modified update rule in which to find the updates, one solves for i in observed[i] = expected[i] eif# + i + i 2 SCGIS can be modified in a similar way to use an update rule in which one solves for i in observed[i] = expected[i]ei maxj,y fi(xj,y) + i + i 2 3 Previous Work Although sequential updating was described for joint probabilities in the original paper on GIS by CITATION, GIS with sequential updating for conditional models appears previously unknown,,

1 Introduction Conditional Maximum Entropy models have been used for a variety of natural language tasks, including Language Modeling CITATION, partof-speech tagging, prepositional phrase attachment, and parsing CITATION, word selection for machine translation CITATION, and finding sentence boundaries CITATION,,

There have been several attempts to speed up maxent training (Della CITATION; CITATION; CITATION),,
