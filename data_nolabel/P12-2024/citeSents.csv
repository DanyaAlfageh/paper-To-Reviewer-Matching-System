Dependency relations (DR) have been extracted parsing English texts and Spanish hypotheses with DepPattern CITATION,,
Our new features have been compared with: i) the state-of-the-art CLTE model (PT), ii) the best monolingual model (Pivot-PPT) presented in CITATION, and iii) the average result achieved by participants in,,
Our new features have been compared with: i) the state-of-the-art CLTE model (PT), ii) the best monolingual model (Pivot-PPT) presented in CITATION, and iii) the average result achieved by participants in the monolingual English RTE-3 evaluation campaign (RTE-3 AVG),,
The CLTE methods proposed so far adopt either a pivoting approach based on the translation of the two input texts into the same language CITATION, or an integrated solution that exploits bilingual phrase tables to capture lexical relations and contextual information CITATION,,
To this aim, we compare the results obtained by the new CLTE model with those reported in CITATION, calculated over an EnglishSpanish entailment corpus derived from the RTE-3 dataset CITATION,,
The semantic phrase table (SPT) was extracted from the same corpora annotated with FreeLing CITATION,,

In this paper we set such problem as an application-oriented, crosslingual variant of the Textual Entailment (TE) recognition task CITATION,,
So far, cross-lingual textual entailment (CLTE) has been only applied to: i) available TE datasets (uni-directional relations between monolingual pairs) transformed into their cross-lingual counterpart by translating the hypotheses into other languages CITATION, and ii) machine translation (MT) evaluation datasets CITATION,,
5 p &lt; 0.05, calculated using the approximate randomization test implemented in CITATION,,
Results are compared with two pivoting approaches, checking for entailment between the original English texts and the translated German hypotheses.4 The first (Pivot-EDITS), uses an optimized distance-based model implemented in the open source RTE system EDITS (CITATION; CITATION),,
Finally, we extract the semantic phrase table from the augmented aligned corpora using the Moses toolkit CITATION,,
2 CLTE-based content synchronization CLTE has been proposed by CITATION as an extension of textual entailment which consists of decidi,,
Dependency relations (DR) have been extracted running the Stanford parser (CITATION; De Marneffe et al., 2006),,
4 Experiments and results 4.1 Content synchronization scenario In our first experiment we used the English-German portion of the CLTE corpus described in CITATION, consisting of 500 multi-directional entailment pairs which we equally divided into training and test sets,,
2 CLTE-based content synchronization CLTE has been proposed by CITATION as an extension of textual entailment which consists of deciding, given a text T and an hypothesis H in different languages, if the meaning of H can be inferred from the meaning of T,,

The second (Pivot-PPT) exploits paraphrase tables for phrase matching, and represents the best monolingual model presented in CITATION,,
Similarly, the semantic phrase table (SPT) has been ex2 Recently, a new dataset including Unknown pairs has been used in the Cross-Lingual Textual Entailment for Content Synchronization task at SemEval-2012 CITATION,,
Then, we combine the sequences of unique labels into one single token of the same label, and we run Giza++ CITATION to align the resulting semantically augmented corpora,,
