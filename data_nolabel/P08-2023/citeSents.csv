In the feature-based framework, CITATION employed ME models to combine diverse lexical, syntactic and semantic features derived from word, entity type, mention level, overlap, dependency and parse tree,,
In the feature-based framework, CITATION employed ME,,
 composite kernel that combined parse tree kernel with entity kernel and CITATION experimented with a context-sensitive kernel by automatically determining context-sensitive tree spans,,
In the feature-based framework, CITATION employed ME models to combine diverse lexical, syntactic and semantic features derived from word, entity type, mention level, overlap, dependency and parse tr,,
Later, Zhang et al (2006) developed a composite kernel that combined parse tree kernel with entity kernel and CITATION experimented with a context-sensitive kernel by automatically determining context-sensitive tree spans,,
CITATION extended this work to estimate similarity between augmented dependency trees,,
 CITATION extended this work to estimate similarity between augmented dependency trees,,
The above two work was further advanced by CITATION who argued that the information to extract a relation between two entities can be typically captured by the shortest path between them in the dependency graph,,
Based on his work, CITATION 89 \x0cfurther incorporated the base phrase chunking information and semi-automatically collected country name list and personal relative trigger word list,,
CITATION then systematically explored a large space of features and evaluated the effectiveness of different feature subspaces corresponding to sequence, syntactic parse tree and dependency parse tree,,
