(For more information on model building consult CITATION),,
Here the predicate symbols from the DRS are mapped to WordNet synsets using a variant of Lesks WSD algorithm CITATION,,
We then trained a decision tree for classification into TRUE and FALSE entailment on the development set, using the Weka machine learning tool CITATION, and tested on the test set,,
The semantic representation language is a first-order fragment of the DRSlanguage used in Discourse Representation Theory CITATION, conveying argument structure with a neo-Davidsonian analysis and including the recursive DRS structure to cover negation, disjunction, and implication,,
The basic idea of our deep analysis, using a detailed semantic analysis and first-order inference, goes back to CITATION,,
Our evaluation measures are accuracy (acc) as the percentage of correct judgements as well as confidence-weighted average score (cws), which rewards the systems ability to assign a higher confidence score to correct judgements than wrong ones CITATION: after the n judgements are sorted in decreasing order by their confidence value, the following measure is computed: cws = 1 n n X i=1 #correct-up-rank-i i All evaluation measures are computed over the whole test set as well as on the 7 different subsets (CD, IE, etc.),,
3 Deep Semantic Analysis 3.1 Semantic Interpretation We use a robust wide-coverage CCG-parser CITATION to generate fine-grained semantic representations for each T/H-pair,,
For a more exhaustive description of dataset design we refer the reader to CITATION,,
5 Related Work Our shallow analysis is similar to the IDF models proposed by (Monz and de Rijke, 2003; CITATION),,
To check whether an entailment holds or not, we use two kinds of automated reasoning tools: Vampire, a theorem prover CITATION, and Paradox, a model builder CITATION,,
We use the standard translation from DRS to firstorder logic CITATION to map our semantic representation onto the format required by the inference tools,,
The aforementioned RTE workshop revealed that participating systems reached accuracy figures ranging between 0.50 and 0.59 and cws scores between 0.50 and 0.69 CITATION,,
using the OTTER theorem prover (CITATION; CITATION), using EPILOG CITATION, or abduction CITATION,,
