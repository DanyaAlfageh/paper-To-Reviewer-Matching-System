Introduction Although language can be seen as simply a method for exchanging information, it also has a social function (CITATION; CITATION; CITATION),,
In previous work, we also applied this method to scoring randomly produced outputs of PERSONAGE CITATION,,
PERSONAGE does not currently express personality through prosody, although there are studies that could be used to develop such parameters (CITATION; CITATION),,
Whereas most previous work on SNLG is based on the overgenerate and scoring (OS) framework (CITATION; Walker, Rambow, and Rogati 2002; Isard, Brockmann, and Oberlander 2006), our results show that direct parameter optimization is a viable alternative for stylistic control,,
The seminal work of CITATION in this area showed that high quality paraphrases can be generated from an underspecified representation of meaning, by first applying a very underconstrained, rule-based overgeneration phase, whose outputs are then ranked by an SLM scoring phase,,
CITATION adopt a more general framework by learning a regression model mapping generation decisions to stylistic dimensions extracted from a corpus, independently of the language generation mechanism,,
Our evaluation of PERSONAGE-RB is the only other result that we know of for non-statistical generators CITATION,,
m SLMs can only model local linguistic phenomena, Belz showed that a context-free grammar (PCFG) can successfully model individual differences in the production of weather reports (CITATION, 2008),,
CITATION adopt a more general framework by learning a regression model mapping generation decisions to stylistic dimensions extracted from a corpus, independently of the langua,,
Finally, the RealPro surface realizer CITATION converts the final syntactic structure into a string by applying surface grammatical rules, such as morphological inflection and function word insertion,,
The parameter estimation approach is inspired by previous work by CITATION, who present a data-driven method for stylistic control that does not require an overgeneration phase,,
It also offers the promise of techniques for producing continuous stylistic variation over multiple stylistic factors by automatically learning a model of the relation between stylistic factors and properties (parameters) of generated utterances (CITATION, 2005),,

The bottom row of Table 4 also compares the naturalness of the random utterances with the naturalness of the rule-based utterances produced by PERSONAGE-RB (CITATION; CITATION),,
The remaining utterances were generated using the handcrafted parameter settings of PERSONAGE-RB for each end of each Big Five trait CITATION,,
erformance of the scoring models approaches the gold-standard human ranking with a relatively small training set (Rambow, Rogati, and Walker 2001; CITATION; CITATION),,
The mapping from a finding to parameters represents a set of hypotheses about how the finding can be implemented, however, as discussed in more detail in CITATION and CITATION,,
A cache model based on recently used linguistic forms can also be combined, in order to model recency effects and alignment CITATION,,
Much of the research on generating utterances that manifest different linguistic styles has focused on text generation applications such as journalistic writing or instruction manuals (CITATION; Scott and de Souza 1990; CITATION; CITATION; Bouayad-Agha, Scot,,
The PERSONAGE architecture (Figure 1) builds on a standard natural language generation (NLG) pipeline architecture as described in CITATION, Kittredge, Korelsky, and Rambow (1991), and CITATION,,
In contrast with the overgeneratescore (OS) method discussed in Section 1.1, parameter estimation models predict generation decisions directly from input personality scores, in the spirit of the approach of CITATION,,
We modeled stylistic variation in terms of the Big Five personality traits, because these traits are widely accepted as the most important dimensions of behavioral variation within human beings (CITATION; CITATION),,
Whereas n-gram SLMs can only model local linguistic phenomena, Belz showed that a context-free grammar (PCFG) can successfully model individual differences in the production of weather reports (CITATION, 2008),,
9; CITATION),,
Another important area for future work is to explore the interface between the language generator and the dialogue manager and text-to-speech (TTS) engine, because personality also affects aspects of dialogue such as initiative and prosodic realization (CITATION; CITATION),,
These correlations are unexpectedly high; in corpus analyses, significant correlations as low as .05 to .15 are typically observed between averaged personality ratings and linguistic markers (CITATION; Mehl, Gosling, and Pennebaker 2006),,
For example, there are 12 content planning parameters shown in the first block of Table 2; these control aspects of utterances such as their verbosity, rhetorical structure, content selection parameters such as positive content, and the level of redundancy and restatement CITATION,,
Although some cues appear to be produced through automatic cognitive processes (CITATION; CITATION), speakers may also overload their This work was done at the University of Sheffield,,
In previous work we describe a rule-based version of PERSONAGE, which here we will refer to as PERSONAGE-RB (CITATION; CITATION),,
Much of the research on generating utterances that manifest different linguistic styles has focused on text generation applications such as journalistic writing or instruction manuals (CITATION; Scott and de Souza 1990; CITATION; Green,,
Our dictionary is currently handcrafted, but future work could build on research on methods for extracting the generation dictionary from data (Barzilay and CITATION; Higashinaka, Walker, and Prasad 2007; CITATION),,
Second, we present a method for learning parameter estimation models predicting generation decisions directly from input personality scores, whereas the method of CITATION requires a search for the optimal generation decision over the models input space,,
It is important to note that the magnitudes of the model correlations are high compared to traditional correlations between personality and linguistic markers, which typically range from .05 to .10 (CITATION; Mehl, Gosling, and Pennebaker 2006),,
This model of human personality has become widely accepted in psychology over the last 50 years CITATION,,
A major advantage of the Big Five framework is that it offers standard validated questionnaires (John, Donahue, and Kentle 1991; CITATION; Gosling, Rentfrow, and Swann 2003),,
It might be possible to apply a similar methodology to the parameterization of a dialogue manager and a TTS component, in order to project a consistent personality to the user, or to use a reinforcement learning approach to train the dialogue manager (Walker, Fromer, and Narayanan 1998; CITATION), with personality judgments as the objective function,,
The first approach has used SLMs to rerank a large set of candidate utterances, and focused on grammaticality and naturalness (CITATION; LangkildeGeary 2002; CITATION; CITATION),,
Future work should consider whether it is possible to flatten the distribution of training data, perhaps using more knowledge or active learning methods for NLG CITATION,,
arco 1996; Bouayad-Agha, Scott, and Power 2000; Power, Scott, and Bouayad-Agha 2003; CITATION),,
Complete details on the implementation of individual parameters can be found in CITATION and CITATION,,
There is growing evidence that dialogue systems such as intelligent tutoring systems are more effective if they can generate a range of different types of stylistic linguistic variation (CITATION, 2006; CITATION; CITATION; McQuiggan, Mott, and Lester 2008; CITATION),,
Factors are identified by applying factor analysis to a corpus exhibiting stylistic variation, and expressed as a linear combination of linguistic features CITATION,,
CITATION showed that this technique can be used to model individual preferences in rhetorical structure, syntactic form, and content ordering,,
2000; CITATION; CITATION),,
In PERSONAGE-RB, generation parameters are implemented, and their values are set based on correlations between linguistic cues and the Big Five traits that have been systematically documented in the psychology literature (CITATION; CITATION; CITATION; Mehl, Gosling, and Pennebaker 2006),,

This approach typically uses higher-level syntactic, semantic, and discourse features rather than only n-grams, with typical results demonstrating that the performance of the scoring models approaches the gold-standard human ranking with a relatively small training set (Rambow, Rogati, and Walker 2001; CITATION; CITATION),,
We then computed post hoc features consisting of the actual generation decisions, surface word n-grams, and contentanalysis features from the Linguistic Inquiry and Word Count (LIWC) tool (Pennebaker, Francis, and Booth 2001) and the MRC psycholinguistic database CITATION,,

Finally, this work focuses on controlling the perceptions of the output of a dialogue system, but an important next step is to use these techniques together with personalitybased user modeling methods CITATION to simultaneously model the personality of the user and the system in dialogue,,

In order to identify what model should be used for each parameter, we compare various learning algorithms using the Weka toolbox CITATION,,
The PERSONAGE Base Generator The architecture of the PERSONAGE base generator is shown in Figure 1; it is discussed in detail in CITATION and CITATION, and is only briefly summarized here,,
However, previous personality recognition results suggest that observed openness to experience is difficult to model using general conversational data as well CITATION,,
PERSONAGE-RB only generates 10 discrete personalities emphasizing either the high or the low end of one trait; however, psychologists measure personality traits on continuous scales (CITATION; CITATION; CITATION), and human language simultaneously manifests multiple personality traits,,
Much of the research on generating utterances that manifest different linguistic styles has focused on text generation applications such as journalistic writing or instruction manuals (CITATION; Scott and de Souza 1990; CITATION; CITATION; Bouayad-Agha, Scott, and Power 2000; Power, Scott, and Bouayad-Agha 2003; CITATION),,
