OpinionFinder uses a large set of features to identify the contextual polarity of a given polarized word given its isolated polarity and the sentence in which it appears (CITATIONb),,
Finally, the results support CITATION findings that anaphora resolution aids opinion mining systems,,
4.2 Choice of the clustering algorithm We experimented with three different clustering algorithms: expectation maximization (EM), and kmeans CITATION, and FarthestFirst (FF) (CITATION; CITATION),,
CITATION showed experimentally that resolving the anaphoric links in the text significantly improves opinion target extraction,,
We tried two methods for clustering the resulting graph: spectral partitioning CITATION and a hierarchical agglomeration algorithm which works by greedily optimizing the modularity for graphs CITATION,,
