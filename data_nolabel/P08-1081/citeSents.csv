CITATION segmented internet relay chat, clustered segments into subtopics, and identified responding segments of the first segment in each sub-topic by assuming the first segment to be focus,,
This experiment is to evaluate Linear CRF model (Section 3.1) for context and answer detection by comparing with SVM and C4.5CITATION,,
In addition, to bridge the lexical gaps between question and context, we learned top-3 context terms for each question term from 300,000 question-description pairs obtained from Yahoo! Answers using mutual information CITATION ( question description in Yahoo! Answers is comparable to contexts in fo1 The semantic similarity between sentences is calculated as in CITATION,,
The method of finding follow-up questions CITATION from TREC context track could be adapted for context de,,
CITATION leveraged both quotation relation and clue words for email summarization,,

2D CRF model is used in CITATION to model the neighborhood dependency in blocks within a web page,,
For SVM, we use SVMlightCITATION,,
(CITATION; CITATION; CITATION; CITATION; CITATION),,
CITATIONa) used cosine similarity to match students query with reply posts for discussion-bot,,
antic similarity between words is computed based on Wu and Palmers measure CITATION using WordNet (Fellbaum, 1998).1 The similarity between contiguous sentences will be used to capture the dependency for CRFs,,
The semantic similarity between words is computed based on Wu and Palmers measure CITATION using WordNet (Fellbaum, 1998).1 The similarity between contiguous sentences will be used to capture the dependency for CRFs,,
In (CITATION; CITATION; CITATION), email summaries were organized by extracting overview sentences as discussion issues,,
We tried GATE CITATION for anaphora resolution of the pronouns in questions, but the performance became worse with the feature, which is probably due to the difficulty of anaphora resolution in forum discourse,,
In our other work CITATION, we proposed a supervised approach for question detection and an unsupervised approach for answer detection without considering context detection,,
(See Section 3.4 for more about CRFs) Linear CRF model has been successfully applied in NLP and text mining tasks (CITATION; CITATION),,
CITATIONb) identified the most important message in online classroom discussion board,,
Skipchain CRF model is applied for entity extraction and meeting summarization (CITATION; CITATION),,
To this end, we proposed a general framework to detect contexts and answers based on Conditional Random Fields CITATION (CRFs) which are able to model the sequential dependencies between contiguous nodes,,
For fast inference, loopy Belief Propagation CITATION is implemented,,
CITATIONs work on email summarizatio,,
We assume the questions have been identified in a forum thread using the approach in CITATION,,
CITATION used statistical translation model to find the appropriate answers from their QA pair collections from FAQ pages for the posted question,,
