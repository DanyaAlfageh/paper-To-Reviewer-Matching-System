NeATS is among the best performers in the large scale summarization evaluation CITATION,,
Since we do n ot use discourse level selection criteria a la CITATION, we simply reduce the scores of these sentences to avoid including them in short summaries,,
It was also used as a baseline in a preliminary multi -document summarization study by CITATION with relatively good results,,
CITATION treated the completeness of coverage as threshold: 4 for all, 3 for most and above, 2 for some and above, and 1 for hardly any and above,,
However, the area is still being fleshed out: most past efforts have focused only on single-document summarization (Mani 2000), and no standard test sets and large scale evaluations have been reported or made available to the Englishspeaking research community except the TIPSTER SUMMAC Text Summarization evaluation CITATION,,
2.2.1 Sentence Position Sentence position has been used as a good important content filter since the late 60s CITATION,,
This is similar to the idea of topic signature introduced in CITATION,,
The recall at threshold t, Recallt (Section 4.1.1), proposed by CITATION, is a good example,,
Section 3 gives a brief overview of the evaluation procedure used in DUC-2001 CITATION,,
It leverages techniques proved effective in single document summarization such as: term frequency CITATION, sentence position (Lin and Hovy 1997), stigma words CITATION, and a simplified version of MMR CITATION to select and filter content,,
Since we do n ot use discourse level selection criteria a la CITATION, we simply reduce the scores of these sentences to avoid including them in short summa,,
4.1.1 Recall, Coverage, Retention and Weighted Retention Recall at different compression ratios has been used in summarization research CITATION to measure how well an automatic system retains important content of original documents,,
To address the problem, we use a simplified version of CMUs MMR CITATION algorithm,,
3 CITATION Before we present our results, we describe the corpus and evaluation procedures of the Document Understanding Conference 2001 CITATION,,
3.2 Summary Evaluation Environment NIST used the Summary Evaluation Environment (SEE) 2.0 developed by one of the authors CITATION to support its human evaluation process,,
Proceedings of the 40th Annual Meeting of the Association for \x0cIn a key step for locating important sentences, NeATS computes the likelihood ratio CITATION to identify key concepts in unigrams, bigrams, and trigrams1, using the on- topic document collection as the relevant set and the off-topic document collection as the irrelevant set,,
ence position has been used as a good important content filter since the late 60s CITATION,,
