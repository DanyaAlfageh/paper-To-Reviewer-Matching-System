NeATS is a multi-document

to extract relevant or interesting

about some topic and present them

<bodyText confidence="0.9988739">
In recent years, text summarization has been
enjoying a period of revival. Two workshops
on Automatic Summarization were held in
2000 and 2001. However, the area is still
being fleshed out: most past efforts have
focused only on single-document
summarization (Mani 2000), and no standard
test sets and large scale evaluations have been
reported or made available to the English-
speaking research community except the

evaluation (Mani et al. 1998).
To address these issues, the Document
Understanding Conference (DUC) sponsored
by the National Institute of Standards and
Technology (NIST) started in 2001 in the
United States. The Text Summarization
Challenge (TSC) task under the NTCIR (NII-
NACSIS Test Collection for IR Systems)
project started in 2000 in Japan. DUC and
TSC both aim to compile standard training and
test collections that can be shared among
researchers and to provide common and large
scale evaluations in single and multiple
document summarization for their participants.
In this paper we describe a multi
-document
summarization system NeATS. It attempts to
extract relevant or interesting portions from a
set of documents about some topic and present
them in coherent order. We outline the
NeATS system and describe how it performs
content selection, filtering, and presentation in
Section 2. Section 3 gives a brief overview of
the evaluation procedure used in DUC-2001
(DUC 2001). Section 4 discusses evaluation
metrics, and Section 5 the results. We
conclude with future directions.

NeATS is an extraction-based multi
-document
summarization system. It leverages techniques
proved effective in single document
summarization such as: term frequency (Luhn
1969), sentence position (Lin and Hovy 1997),
stigma words (Edmundson 1969), and a
simplified version of MMR (Goldstein et al.
1999) to select and filter content. To improve
topic coverage and readability, it uses term
clustering, a buddy system of paired
sentences, and explicit time annotation.
Most of the techniques adopted by NeATS are
not new. However, applying them in the
proper places to summarize multiple
documents and evaluating the results on large
scale common tasks are new.
Given an input of a collection of sets of
newspaper arti
cles, NeATS generates
summaries in three stages: content selection,
filtering, and presentation. We describe each
stage in the following sections.
</bodyText>
<subsectionHeader confidence="0.997532">
2.1 Content Selection
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.985204875">
The goal of content selection is to identify
important concepts mentioned in a document
collection. For example, AA flight 11, AA
flight 77, UA flight 173, UA flight 93, New
York, World Trade Center, Twin Towers,
Osama bin Laden, and al-Qaida are key
concepts for a document collection about the
September 11 terrorist attacks in the US.
Computational Linguistics (ACL), Philadelphia, July 2002, pp. 457-464.
Proceedings of the 40th Annual Meeting of the Association for
\x0cIn a key step for locating important sentences,
NeATS computes the likelihood ratio
(Dunning, 1993) to identify key concepts in
unigrams, bigrams, and trigrams1, using the
on- topic document collection as the relevant
set and the off-topic document collection as the
irrelevant set. Figure 1 shows the top 5
concepts with their relevancy scores (
-2) for
the topic Slovenia Secession from
Yugoslavia in the DUC-2001 test collection.
This is similar to the idea of topic signature
introduced in (Lin and Hovy 2000).
With the individual key concepts available, we
proceed to cluster these concepts in order to
identify major subtopics within the main topic.
Clusters are formed through strict lexical
connection. For example, Milan and Kucan
are grouped as Milan Kucan since Milan
Kucan is a key bigram concept; while
Croatia, Yugoslavia, Slovenia, republic, and
are joined due to the connections as follows:
</bodyText>
<figure confidence="0.2642294">

<bodyText confidence="0.903159882352941">
were ignored in constructing unigrams, bigrams and
trigrams.
Croatia republic
Each sentence in the document set is then
ranked, using the key concept structures. An
example is shown in Figure 2. The ranking
algorithm rewards most specific concepts first;
for example, a sentence containing Milan
Kucan has a higher score than a sentence
contains only either Milan or Kucan. A
sentence containing both Milan and Kucan but
not in consecutive order gets a lower score too.
This ranking algorithm performs relatively
well, but it also results in many ties.
Therefore, it is necessary to apply some
filtering mechanism to maintain a reasonably
sized sentence pool for final presentation.
</bodyText>
<subsectionHeader confidence="0.999957">
2.2 Content Filtering
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.998008333333333">
NeATS uses three different filters: sentence
position, stigma words, and maximum
marginal relevancy.
</bodyText>
<subsubsectionHeader confidence="0.955881">
2.2.1 Sentence Position
</subsubsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.962282888888889">
Sentence position has been used as a good
important content filter since the late 60s
(Edmundson 1969). It was also used as a
baseline in a preliminary multi
-document
summarization study by Marcu and Gerber
(2001) with relatively good results. We apply
a simple sentence filter that only retains the
lead 10 sentences.
</bodyText>
<subsubsectionHeader confidence="0.975013">
2.2.2 Stigma Words
</subsubsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.998408909090909">
Some sentences start with
conjunctions (e.g., but, although, however),
the verb sayand its derivatives,
quotation marks,
pronouns such as he, she, and they,
and usually cause discontinuity in summaries.
Since we do n
ot use discourse level selection
criteria a la (Marcu 1999), we simply reduce
the scores of these sentences to avoid including
them in short summaries.

\x0cThe content selection and filtering methods
described in the previous section only concern
individual sentences. They do not consider the
redundancy issue when two top ranked
sentences refer to similar things. To address
the problem, we use a simplified version of
CMUs MMR (Goldstein et al. 1999)
algorithm. A sentence is added to the
summary if and only if its content has less than
X percent overlap with the summary. The
overlap ratio is computed using simple
stemmed word overlap and the threshold X is
set empirically.
</bodyText>
<subsectionHeader confidence="0.999681">
2.3 Content Presentation
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.9979073">
NeATS so far only considers features
pertaining to individual sentences. As we
mentioned in Section 2.2.2, we can demote
some sentences containing stigma words to
improve the cohesion and coherence of
summaries. However, we still face two
problems: definite noun phrases and events
spread along an extended timeline. We
describe these problems and our solutions in
the following sections.
</bodyText>
<subsubsectionHeader confidence="0.774026">
2.3.1 A Buddy System of Paired Sentences
</subsubsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.9975149">
The problem of definite noun phrases can be
illustrated in Figure 3. These sentences are
from documents of the DUC-2001 topic US
Drought of 1988. According to pure sentence
scores, sentence 3 of document AP891210-
0079 has a higher score (34.60) than sentence
1 (32.20) and should be included in the shorter
summary (size=50). However, if we select
sentence 3 without also including sentence 1,
the definite noun phrase The record $3.9
billion drought relief program of 1988 seems
to come without any context. To remedy this
problem, we introduce a buddy system to
improve cohesion and coherence. Each
sentence is paired with a suitable introductory
sentence unless it is already an introductory
sentence. In DUC-2001 we simply used the
first sentence of its document. This assumes
lead sentences provide introduction and
context information about what is coming next.
</bodyText>
<subsubsectionHeader confidence="0.859743">
2.3.2 Time Annotation and Sequence
</subsubsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.88026064">
One main problem in multi
-document
summarization is that documents in a
collection might span an extended time period.
For example, the DUC-2001 topic Slovenia
Secession from Yugoslavia contains 11
documents dated from 1988 to 1994, from 5
different sources 2. Although a source
document for single-document summarization
might contain information collected across an
extended time frame and from multiple
sources, the author at least would synchronize
them and present them in a coherent order. In
multi-document summarization, a date
expression such as Monday occurring in two
different documents might mean the same date
or different dates. For example, sentences in
the 100 word summary shown in Figure 4
come from 3 main time periods, 1
990, 1991,
and 1994. If no absolute time references are
given, the summary might mislead the reader
to think that all the events mentioned in the
four summary sentences occurred in a single
week. Therefore, time disambiguation and
normalization are very important in multi-
document summarization. As the first attempt,
we use publication dates as reference points
and compute actual dates for the following
date expressions:
weekdays (Sunday, Monday, etc);
(past  |next  |coming) + weekdays;
today, yesterday, last night.
We then order the summary sentences in their
chronological order. Figure 4 shows an

documents: given a set of document on a
single subject, participants were required to
create 4 generic summaries of the entire set
with approximately 50, 100, 200, and 400
words. 30 document sets of approximately 10
documents each were provided with their 50,
100, 200, and 400 human written summaries
for training (training set) and another 30
unseen sets were used for testing (test set).

were encouraged to investigate alternative
approaches in summarization and report their

NeATS participated only in the fully automatic
multi-document summarization task. A total
of 12 systems participated in that task.

March of 2001 and the test data were
distributed in mid-June of 2001. Results were

NIST assessors who created the ideal written
summaries did pairwise comparisons of their
summaries to the system-generated summaries,
other assessors summaries, and baseline
summaries. In addition, two baseline
summaries were created automatically as
reference points. The first baseline, lead
baseline, took the first 50, 100, 200, and 400
words in the last document in the collection.
The second baseline, coverage baseline, took
the first sentence in the first document, the first

<bodyText confidence="0.984013611111111">
NIST used the Summary Evaluation
Environment (SEE) 2.0 developed by one of
the authors (Lin 2001) to support its human
evaluation process. Using SEE, the assessors
evaluated the quality of the systems text (the
peer text) as compared to an ideal (the model
text). The two texts were broken into lists of
units and displayed in separate windows. In
DUC-2001 the sentence was used as the
smallest unit of evaluation.
SEE 2.0 provides interfaces for assessors to
judge the quality of summaries in
grammatically3, cohesion4, and coherence5 at
five different levels: all, most, some, hardly
any, or none. It also allows assessors to step

4 Evaluation Metrics
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999481875">
One goal of DUC-2001 was to debug the
evaluation procedures and identify stable
metrics that could serve as common reference
points. NIST did not define any official
performance metric in DUC-2001. It released
the raw evaluation results to DUC-2001
participants and encouraged them to propose
metrics that would help progress the field.
</bodyText>
<subsubsectionHeader confidence="0.7700115">
4.1.1 Recall, Coverage, Retention and
Weighted Retention
</subsubsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.989945823529412">
Recall at different compression ratios has been
used in summarization research (Mani 2001) to
measure how well an automatic system retains
important content of original documents.
Assume we have a system summary Ss and a
model summary Sm. The number of sentences
occurring in both Ss and Sm is Na, the number
of sentences in Ss is Ns, and the number of
sentences in Sm is Nm. Recall is defined as
Na/Nm. The Compression Ratio is defined as
the length of a summary (by words or
sentences) divided by the length of its original
document. DUC-2001 set the compression
lengths to 50, 100, 200, and 400 words for the
multi-document summarization task.
However, applying recall in DUC-2001
without modification is not appropriate
</bodyText>
<listItem confidence="0.9327152">
because:
1. Multiple system units contribute to
multiple model units.
2. Ss and Sm do not exactly overlap.
3. Overlap judgment is not binary.
</listItem>
<bodyText confidence="0.936432486486487">
For example, in an evaluation session an
assessor judged system units S1.1 and S10.4 as
sharing some content with model unit M2.2.
Unit S1.1 says Thousands of people are
feared dead and unit M2.2 says
3,000 and
perhaps ... 5,000 people have been killed.
Are thousands equivalent to 3,000 to
5,000 or not? Unit S10.4 indicates it was an
earthquake of magnitude 6.9 and unit M2.2
says it was an earthquake measuring 6.9 on
the Richter scale. Both of them report a 6.9
earthquake. But the second part of system
unit S10.4, in an area so isolated..., seems
to share some content with model unit M4.4
the quake was centered in a remote
mountainous area. Are these two equivalent?
This example highlights the difficulty of
judging the content coverage of system
summaries against model summaries and the
inadequacy of using recall as defined.
As we mentioned earlier, NIST assessors not
only marked the sharing relations among
system units (SU) and model units (MU), they
also indicated the degree of match, i.e., all,
most, some, hardly any, or none. This enables
us to compute weighted recall.
Different versions of weighted recall were
proposed by DUC-2001 participants.
McKeown et al. (2001) treated the
completeness of coverage as threshold: 4 for
all, 3 for most and above, 2 for some and
above, and 1 for hardly any and above. They
then proceeded to compare system
performances at different threshold levels.
They defined recall at threshold t, Recallt, as
follows:

<bodyText confidence="0.992289285714286">
We used the completeness of coverage as
coverage score, C, instead of threshold: 1 for
all, 3/4 for most, 1/2 for some, and 1/4 for
hardly any, 0 for none. To avoid confusion
with the recall used in information retrieval,
we call our metric weighted retention,
Retentionw, and define it as follows:

if we ignore C and set it always to 1, we obtain
an unweighted retention, Retention1. We used
Retention1 in our evaluation to illustrate that
relative system performance changes when
different evaluation metrics are chosen.
Therefore, it is important to have common and
agreed upon metrics to facilitate large scale
evaluation efforts.
</bodyText>
<subsubsectionHeader confidence="0.915476">
4.1.2 Precision and Pseudo Precision
</subsubsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.988827571428571">
Precision is also a common measure.
Borrowed from information retrieval research,
precision is used to measure how effectively a
system generates good summary sentences. It
is defined as Na/ Ns. Precision in a fixed length
summary output is equal to recall since Ns =
Nm. However, due to the three reasons stated
at the beginning of the previous section, no
straightforward computation of the traditional
precision is available in DUC-2001.
\x0cIf we count the number of model units that are
marked as good summary units and are
selected by systems, and use the number of
model units in various summary lengths as the
sample space, we obtain a precision metric
equal to Retention1. Alternatively, we can
count how many unique system units share
content with model units and use the total
number of system units as the sample space.
We define this as pseudo precision, Precisionp,
as follows:

in their summaries but not exactly the same;
once again illustrating the difficulty of
summarization evaluation.
(4) Despite the low inter-human agreement,
humans score better than any system. They
outscore the nearest system by about 11% in
averaged unweighted retention (R1 all : 53% vs.
42%) and weighted retention (Rw all : 29% vs.
18%). There is obviously still considerable
room for systems to improve.
(5) System performances are separated into
two major groups by baseline 2 (B2: coverage
baseline) in avera
ged weighted retention. This
confirms that lead sentences are good
summary sentence candidates and that one
does need to cover all documents in a topic to
achieve reasonable performance in multi-
document summarization. NeATSs strategies

\x0cthe best, followed by N, and then T; if we
choose averaged weighted retention (Rw all), T
is the best, followed by N, and then Y. The
reversal of T and Y due to different metrics
demonstrates the importance of common
agreed upon metrics. We believe that metrics
have to take coverage score (C, Section 4.1.1)
into consideration to be reasonable since most
of the content sharing among system units and
model units is partial. The recall at threshold t,
Recallt (Section 4.1.1), proposed by
(McKeown et al. 2001), is a good example. In
their evaluation, NeATS ranked second at t=1,
3, 4 and first at t=2.
(7) According to Table 1, NeATS performed
better on longer summaries (400 and 200
words) based on weighted retention than it did
on shorter ones. This is the result of the
sentence extraction-based nature of NeATS.
We expect that systems that use syntax-based
algorithms to compress their output will
thereby gain more space to include additional
important material. For example, System Y
was the best in s
horter summaries. Its 100-
and 50-word summaries contain only
important headlines. The results confirm this
is a very effective strategy in composing short
summaries. However, the quality of the
summaries suffered because of the
unconventional syntactic structure of news
headlines (Table 2).

<bodyText confidence="0.976163648148148">
Table 2 shows the macro-averaged scores for
the humans, two baselines, and 12 systems.
We assign a score of 4 to all, 3 to most, 2 to
some, 1 to hardly any, and 0 to none. The
value assignment is for convenience of
computing averages, since it is more
appropriate to treat these measures as stepped
values instead of continuous ones. With this in
mind, we have the following observations.
(1) Most systems scored well in
grammaticality. This is not a surprise since
most of the participants extracted sentences as
summaries.
But no system or human scored perfect in
grammaticality. This might be due to the
artifact of cutting sentences at the 50, 100, 200,
and 400 words boundaries. Only system Y
scored lower than 3, which reflects its headline
inclusion strategy.
(2) When it came to the measure for cohesion
the results are confusing. If even the human-
made summaries score only 2.74 out of 4, it is
unclear what this category means, or how the
assessors arrived at these scores. However, the
humans and baseline 1 (lead baseline) did
score in the upper range of 2 to 3 and all others
had scores lower than 2.5. Some of the
systems (including B2) fell into the range of 1
to 2 meaning some or hardly any cohesion.
The lead baseline (B1), taking the first 50, 100,
200, 400 words from the last document of a
topic, did well. On the contrary, the coverage
baseline (B2) did poorly. This indicates the
difficulty of fitting sentences from different
documents together. Even selecting
continuous sentences from the same document
(B1) seems not to work well. We need to
define this metric more clearly and improve
the capabilities of systems in this respect.
(3) Coherence scores roughly track cohesion
scores. Most systems did b
etter in coherence
than in cohesion. The human is the only one
scoring above 3. Again the room for
improvement is abundant.
(4) NeATS did not fare badly in quality
measures. It was in the same categories as
other top performers: grammaticality is
between most and all, cohesion, some and
most, and coherence, some and most. This
indicates the strategies employed by NeATS
(stigma word filtering, adding lead sentence,
and time annotation) worked to some extent
but left room for improvement.

summarization system, NeATS, and its
evaluation in DUC-2001. We were encouraged
by the content and readability of the results.
As a prototype system, NeATS deliberately
used simple methods guided by a few
principles:
Extracting important concepts based on
reliable statistics.
Filtering sentences by their positions and
stigma words.
Reducing redundancy using MMR.
Presenting summary sentences in their
chronological order with time annotations.
These simple principles worked effecti
vely.
However, the simplicity of the system also
lends itself to further improvements. We
would like to apply some compression
techniques or use linguistic units smaller than
sentences to improve our retention score. The
fact that NeATS performed as well as the
human in pseudo precision but did less well in
retention indicates its summaries might include
good but duplicated information. Working
with sub-sentence units should help.
To improve NeATSs capability in content
selection, we have started to p
arse sentences
containing key unigram, bigram, and trigram
concepts to identify their relations within their
concept clusters.
To enhance cohesion and coherence, we are
looking into incorporating discourse
processing techniques (Marcu 1999) or Radev
and McKeowns (1998) summary operators.
We are analyzing the DUC evaluation scores
in the hope of suggesting improved and more
stable metrics.

A sentence containing both Milan and Kucan but not in consecutive order gets a lower score too. This ranking algorithm performs relatively well, but it also results in many ties.

They do not consider the redundancy issue when two top ranked sentences refer to similar things. To address the problem, we use a simplified version of CMUs MMR (Goldstein et al. 1999) algorithm. A sentence is added to the summary if and only if its content has less than X percent overlap with the summary. The overlap ratio is computed using simple stemmed word overlap and the threshold X is set empirically. 2.3 Content Presentation NeATS so far only considers features pertaining to individual sentences. As we mentioned in Section 2.2.2, we can demote some sentences containing stigma words to improve the cohesion and coherence of summaries. However, we still face two problems: definite noun phrases and events spread along an extended timeline. We describe these problems and</context>

Figure 1 shows the top 5 concepts with their relevancy scores ( -2) for the topic Slovenia Secession from Yugoslavia in the DUC-2001 test collection. This is similar to the idea of topic signature introduced in (Lin and Hovy 2000). With the individual key concepts available, we proceed to cluster these concepts in order to identify major subtopics within the main topic. Clusters are formed through strict lexical connection. For example, Milan and Kucan are grouped as Milan Kucan since Milan Kucan is a key bigram concept; while Croatia, Yugoslavia, Slovenia, republic, and are joined due to the connections as follows: Slovenia Croatia Croatia Slovenia Yugoslavia Slovenia republic Slovenia 1 Closed class words (of, in, and, are, and so on) were ignored in constructing unigrams, bigrams and trigrams.

In addition, two baseline summaries were created automatically as reference points. The first baseline, lead baseline, took the first 50, 100, 200, and 400 words in the last document in the collection. The second baseline, coverage baseline, took the first sentence in the first document, the first sentence in the second document and so on until it had a summary of 50, 100, 200, or 400 words. 3.2 Summary Evaluation Environment NIST used the Summary Evaluation Environment (SEE) 2.0 developed by one of the authors (Lin 2001) to support its human evaluation process. Using SEE, the assessors evaluated the quality of the systems text (the peer text) as compared to an ideal (the model text). The two texts were broken into lists of units and displayed in separate windows. In DUC-2001 the sentence was used as the smallest unit of evaluation. SEE 2.0 provides interfaces for assessors to judge the quality of summaries in grammatically3, cohesion4, and coherence5 at five different levels: all, most, some, hardly any, or none.

It leverages techniques proved effective in single document summarization such as: term frequency (Luhn 1969), sentence position (Lin and Hovy 1997), stigma words (Edmundson 1969), and a simplified version of MMR (Goldstein et al. 1999) to select and filter content. To improve topic coverage and readability, it uses term clustering, a buddy system of paired sentences, and explicit time annotation. Most of the techniques adopted by NeATS are not new. However, applying them in the proper places to summarize multiple documents and evaluating the results on large scale common tasks are new.

NeATS is among the best performers in the large scale summarization evaluation DUC 2001. 1 Introduction In recent years, text summarization has been enjoying a period of revival. Two workshops on Automatic Summarization were held in 2000 and 2001. However, the area is still being fleshed out: most past efforts have focused only on single-document summarization (Mani 2000), and no standard test sets and large scale evaluations have been reported or made available to the Englishspeaking research community except the TIPSTER SUMMAC Text Summarization evaluation (Mani et al. 1998). To address these issues, the Document Understanding Conference (DUC) sponsored by the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) started in 2001 in the United States. The Text Summarization Challenge (TSC) task under the NTCIR (NIINACSIS Test Collection for IR Systems) project started in 2000 in Japan. DUC and TSC both aim to compile standard training and test collections that can be shared among researchers and to provide common and large scale evaluations in single and multiple document summarization for their participants.

NIST did not define any official performance metric in DUC-2001. It released the raw evaluation results to DUC-2001 participants and encouraged them to propose metrics that would help progress the field. 4.1.1 Recall, Coverage, Retention and Weighted Retention Recall at different compression ratios has been used in summarization research (Mani 2001) to measure how well an automatic system retains important content of original documents. Assume we have a system summary Ss and a model summary Sm. The number of sentences occurring in both Ss and Sm is Na, the number of sentences in Ss is Ns, and the number of sentences in Sm is Nm. Recall is defined as Na/Nm. The Compression Ratio is defined as the length of a summary (by words or sentences) divided by the length of its original document. DUC-2001 set the compression lengths to 50, 100, 200, and 400 words for the multi-document summarization task. However, applying recall in DUC-2001 withou</context>

Are these two equivalent? This example highlights the difficulty of judging the content coverage of system summaries against model summaries and the inadequacy of using recall as defined. As we mentioned earlier, NIST assessors not only marked the sharing relations among system units (SU) and model units (MU), they also indicated the degree of match, i.e., all, most, some, hardly any, or none. This enables us to compute weighted recall. Different versions of weighted recall were proposed by DUC-2001 participants. McKeown et al. (2001) treated the completeness of coverage as threshold: 4 for all, 3 for most and above, 2 for some and above, and 1 for hardly any and above. They then proceeded to compare system performances at different threshold levels. They defined recall at threshold t, Recallt, as follows: summary model in the MUs of number Total above or at marked MUs of Number t We used the completeness of coverage as coverage score, C, instead of threshold: 1 for all, 3/4 for most, 1/2 for some, and 1/4 for hardly any, 0 for none.

The reversal of T and Y due to different metrics demonstrates the importance of common agreed upon metrics. We believe that metrics have to take coverage score (C, Section 4.1.1) into consideration to be reasonable since most of the content sharing among system units and model units is partial. The recall at threshold t, Recallt (Section 4.1.1), proposed by (McKeown et al. 2001), is a good example. In their evaluation, NeATS ranked second at t=1, 3, 4 and first at t=2. (7) According to Table 1, NeATS performed better on longer summaries (400 and 200 words) based on weighted retention than it did on shorter ones. This is the result of the sentence extraction-based nature of NeATS. We expect that systems that use syntax-based algorithms to compress their output will thereby gain more space to include additional important material. For example, System Y was the best in s horter summaries. Its 100- and 50-word summaries contain only important headlines. The results confi</context>
