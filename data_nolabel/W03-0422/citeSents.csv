3.2 Voted Perceptron and Kernelization Although the analysis above concerns the perceptron algorithm, we use a modified version, the voted perceptron algorithm, introduced in CITATION,,
Each function is modeled as a voted perceptron CITATION,,
CITATION presented an online topic-ranking algorithm involving several perceptrons and ranking-based update rules for training them,,
CITATION adapted the perceptron learning algorithm to tagging tasks, via sentence-based global feedback,,
Instead, by using dynamic programming the optimal chunking can be found in quadratic time over the sentence length, performing a Viterby-style exploration from left to right CITATION,,
