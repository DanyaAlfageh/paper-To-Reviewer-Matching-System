In the original co-training paper CITATION, it was suggested that the algorithm be understood as seeking to maximize agreement on unlabeled data between classifiers trained on two different views of the data,,
In previous work, I did propose an assumption about the data called precision independence, under which the Yarowsky algorithm could be shown effective CITATION,,
The CITATION algorithm was one of the first bootstrapping algorithms to become widely known in computational linguistics,,
An alternative algorithm, co-training CITATION, has subsequently become more popular, perhaps in part because it has proven amenable to theoretical analysis (Dasgupta, Littman, and McAllester 2001), in contrast to the Yarowsky algorithm, which is as yet mathematically poorly understood,,
The YS algorithms resemble the Yarowsky-Cautious algorithm of CITATION, though they differ from that algorithm in that they update a single feature in each iteration, rather than a small set of features, as in Yarowsky-Cautious,,
