Linked Chains: The linked chains model CITATION represents extraction patterns as a pair of chains which share the same verb but no direct descendants,,
The first corpus consisted of Wall Street Journal texts from the Sixth Message Understanding Conference CITATION IE evaluation,,
We make use of a version of the corpus produced by CITATION in which events described within a single sentence were annotated,,
m CITATION uses patterns which match certain grammatical categories, mainly nouns and verbs, in phrase chunked text while CITATION use subject-verbobject tuples derived from a dependency parse,,
CITATION have also demonstrated that dependency graphs can be produced using Combinatory Categorial Grammar (CCG) and context-free grammar (CFG) parsers,,
Patterns are applied to text which has undergone various levels of linguistic analysis, such as phrase chunking CITATION and full syntactic parsing CITATION,,
 the AutoSlog system CITATION uses patterns which match certain grammatical categories, mainly nouns and verbs, in phrase chunked text while CITATION use subject-verbobject tuples derived from a dependency parse,,
Chains: A pattern is defined as a path between a verb node and any other node in the dependency tree passing through zero or more intermediate nodes CITATION,,
This model may be motivated by the assumption that many IE scenarios involve the extraction 1 CITATION and CITATION used a slightly extended version of this model in which the pattern also included certain phrases which referred to e,,
Subtrees: The final model to be considered is the subtree model CITATION,,
The second corpus uses documents taken from the biomedical domain, specifically the training corpus used in the LLL-05 challenge task CITATION, and a pair of corpora (Craven and Kumlien, 1999) which were derived from the Yeast Proteome Database (YPD) CITATION and the Online Mendelian Inheritance in Man database (OMIM) CITATION,,
2 Pattern Models In dependency analysis CITATION the syntax of a sentence is represented by a set of directed binary links between a word (the head) and one of its modifiers,,
2 The formalism used for representing dependency patterns is similar to the one introduced by CITATION,,
Previous work which has used this representation have used indirect evaluation: document and sentence filtering (CITATION; CITATION),,
For example, the MUC-6 CITATION management succession scenario concerns the identification of individuals who are changing job,,
Several recent approaches to IE have used patterns based on a dependency analysis of the input text (CITATION; CITATION; CITATION; CITATION; CITATION),,
CITATION compared t,,
This has implications on the practical application for each approach, particularly when used for automatic acquisition of IE systems using learning methods (CITATION; CITATION; CITATION),,
Several recent approaches to IE have used patterns based on a dependency analysis of the input text (CITATION; CITATION; CITATION; Bunescu and Moon,,
This model may be motivated by the assumption that many IE scenarios involve the extraction 1 CITATION and CITATION used a slightly extended version of this model in which the pattern also included certain phrases which referred to either the subject or object,,
4.2 Generating Dependency Patterns Three dependency parsers were used for these experiments: MINIPAR3 CITATION, the Machinese Syntax4 parser from Connexor Oy CITATION and the Stanford5 parser CITATION,,
CITATION compared three models in terms of their ab,,
For example, the AutoSlog system CITATION uses patterns which match certain grammatical categories, mainly nouns and verbs, in phrase chunked text while CITATION use subject-verbobject tuples derived from a dependency parse,,
CITATION compared three models in terms of their ability to identify event participants,,
The results presented here suggest that the Stanford parser CITATION is capable of generating analyses for almost all sentences within corpora from two very different domains,,
For example, CITATION uses just subject-verb-object tuples while CITATION allow any subpart of the tree to act as an extraction pattern,,
erns which match certain grammatical categories, mainly nouns and verbs, in phrase chunked text while CITATION use subject-verbobject tuples derived from a dependency parse,,
Predicate-Argument Model (SVO): A simple approach, used by CITATION and CITATION, is to use subject-verbobject tuples from the dependency parse as extraction patterns,,
