In this section, we show that many relationships are consistently expressed using a compact set of relation-independent lexico-syntactic patterns, and quantify their frequency based on a sample of 500 sentences selected at random from an IE training corpus developed by CITATION.1 This observation helps to explain the success of open relation extraction, which learns a relation-independent extraction model as described in Section 3.1.,,

The manual identification of these patterns inspired a body of work in which this initial set of extraction patterns is used to seed a bootstrapping process that automatically acquires additional patterns for is-a or part-whole relations (CITATION; CITATION; CITATION), It is quite natural then to consider whether the same can be done for all binary relationships.,,
