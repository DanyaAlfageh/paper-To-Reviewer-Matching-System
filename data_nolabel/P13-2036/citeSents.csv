CITATION compute initial translation scores using PH and iteratively update the scores using relationsh,,
We implemented and compared the following approaches denoted as the naming convention of listing of the used features in a parenthesis (): (PH+R) in CITATION,,
Early efforts of named entity translation have focused on using phonetic feature (called PH) to estimate a phonetic similarity between two names (CITATION; CITATION; CITATION),,
CITATION holistically combine all the features: PH, CX, T, and R,,
We evaluated the effectiveness of our new approach using four measures: MRR, precision, recall, and F1-score, where MRR CITATION is the average of the reciprocal ranks of the query results defined as follows: MRR = 1 |Q| (u,v)Q 1 rank(u,v) , where Q is a set of ground-truth matched pairs (u, v) such that u Ve and v Vc, and rank(u,v) is the rank of R(u,v) among all R(u,w)s such that w Vc,,
CITATION extend Taos approach by iteratively updating overall similarities using R,,
More recent approaches consider temporal feature (called T) of entities in two corpora (CITATION; CITATION,,
To identify entities, we use a CRF-based named entity tagger CITATION and a Chinese word breaker CITATION for English and Chinese corpora, respectively,,
CITATION compute initial translation scores using PH and iteratively update the scores using relationship feature (called R),,
d Gc = (Vc, Ec) by setting = 20 which was used in CITATION,,
Recently, holistic approaches combining such similarities have been studied (CITATION; CITATION; CITATION),,
More recent approaches consider temporal feature (called T) of entities in two corpora (CITATION; CITATION; Sproat et 0 5 10 15 20 25 30 35 40 45 50 0 50 100 150 200 250 300 Week Frequency English Chinese (a) Temporal entity: Usain Bolt 0 ,,
CITATION rank translation candidates using PH and CX independently and return results with the highest average rank,,
(PH+CX+R+T) in CITATION,,
T is computed using frequency vectors for entities and combined with PH (CITATION; CITATION),,
More recent approaches consider temporal feature (called T) of entities in two corpora (CITATION; CITATION; Sproat et 0 5 10 15 20 25 30 35 40 45 50 0 50 100 150 200 250 300 Week Frequency English Chinese (a) Temporal entity: Usain Bolt 0 5 10 15 20 25 30 35 40 45 50 0 20 40 60 80 Week Frequency English Chinese (b) Atemporal entity: Hillary Clinton Figure 1: Illustration on temporality al., 2006; CITATION),,
In contrast, some approaches have focused on using context feature (called CX) which compares surrounding words of entities (CITATION; CITATION; CITATION),,
nd Finch, 2000; CITATION),,
CITATION holistically combine all the featu,,
CITATION holistically combine all the features: PH, CX, T, an,,
CITATION compute initial translation scores using PH and iteratively update the scores,,
CITATION boost Yous approach by additionally leveraging CX,,
For PH, we use a variant of Edit-Distance CITATION between English entity and a romanized representation of Chinese entity called Pinyin,,
From them, we extracted person entities and built two graphs, Ge = (Ve, Ee) and Gc = (Vc, Ec) by setting = 20 which was used in CITATION,,
More recent approaches consider temporal feature (called T) of entities in two corpora (CITATION; CITATION; Sproat et 0 5 10 15 20 25 30 35 40 45 50 0 50 100 150 200 250 300 Week Frequency English Chinese (a) Temporal en,,
2 Preliminaries Our approach follows a graph alignment framework proposed in CITATION,,
More recent approaches consider temporal feature (called T) of entities in two corpora (CITATION; CITATION; Sproat et 0 5 10 15 20 25 30 35 40 45 50 0 50 100 150 200 250 300 Week Frequency English Chine,,
