We describe a method for incorporating syntactic informa-
tion in statistical machine translation systems. The first step
of the method is to parse the source language string that is be-
ing translated. The second step is to apply a series of trans-
formations to the parse tree, effectively reordering the surface
string on the source language side of the translation system. The
goal of this step is to recover an underlying word order that is
closer to the target language word-order than the original string.
The reordering approach is applied as a pre-processing step in
both the training and decoding phases of a phrase-based statis-
tical MT system. We describe experiments on translation from
German to English, showing an improvement from 25.2% Bleu
score for a baseline system to 26.8% Bleu score for the system
with reordering, a statistically significant improvement.

1 Introduction

<bodyText confidence="0.990311630769231">
Recent research on statistical machine translation
(SMT) has lead to the development of phrase-
based systems (Och et al., 1999; Marcu and Wong,
2002; Koehn et al., 2003). These methods go be-
yond the original IBM machine translation models
(Brown et al., 1993), by allowing multi-word units
(phrases) in one language to be translated directly
into phrases in another language. A number of em-
pirical evaluations have suggested that phrase-based
systems currently represent the stateoftheart in
statistical machine translation.
In spite of their success, a key limitation of
phrase-based systems is that they make little or no
direct use of syntactic information. It appears likely
that syntactic information will be crucial in accu-
rately modeling many phenomena during transla-
tion, for example systematic differences between the
word order of different languages. For this reason
there is currently a great deal of interest in meth-
ods which incorporate syntactic information within
statistical machine translation systems (e.g., see (Al-
shawi, 1996; Wu, 1997; Yamada and Knight, 2001;
Gildea, 2003; Melamed, 2004; Graehl and Knight,
2004; Och et al., 2004; Xia and McCord, 2004)).
In this paper we describe an approach for the use
of syntactic information within phrase-based SMT
systems. The approach constitutes a simple, direct
method for the incorporation of syntactic informa-
tion in a phrasebased system, which we will show
leads to significant improvements in translation ac-
curacy. The first step of the method is to parse the
source language string that is being translated. The
second step is to apply a series of transformations
to the resulting parse tree, effectively reordering the
surface string on the source language side of the
translation system. The goal of this step is to re-
cover an underlying word order that is closer to the
target language word-order than the original string.
Finally, we apply a phrase-based system to the re-
ordered string to give a translation into the target
language.
We describe experiments involving machine
translation from German to English. As an illustra-
tive example of our method, consider the following
German sentence, together with a translation into
English that follows the original word order:
Original sentence: Ich werde Ihnen die entsprechenden An-
merkungen aushaendigen, damit Sie das eventuell bei der
Abstimmung uebernehmen koennen.
English translation: I will to you the corresponding comments
pass on, so that you them perhaps in the vote adopt can.
The German word order in this case is substan-
tially different from the word order that would be
seen in English. As we will show later in this pa-
per, translations of sentences of this type pose dif-
ficulties for phrase-based systems. In our approach
we reorder the constituents in a parse of the German
sentence to give the following word order, which is
much closer to the target English word order (words
which have been moved are underlined):
Reordered sentence: Ich werde aushaendigen Ihnen die
entsprechenden Anmerkungen, damit Sie koennen
uebernehmen das eventuell bei der Abstimmung.
English translation: I will pass on to you the corresponding
comments, so that you can adopt them perhaps in the vote.

\x0cWe applied our approach to translation from Ger-
man to English in the Europarl corpus. Source lan-
guage sentences are reordered in test data, and also
in training data that is used by the underlying phrase-
based system. Results using the method show an
improvement from 25.2% Bleu score to 26.8% Bleu
score (a statistically significant improvement), using
a phrase-based system (Koehn et al., 2003) which
has been shown in the past to be a highly competi-
tive SMT system.

<bodyText confidence="0.999095314285715">
The original work on statistical machine transla-
tion was carried out by researchers at IBM (Brown
et al., 1993). More recently, phrase-based models
(Och et al., 1999; Marcu and Wong, 2002; Koehn
et al., 2003) have been proposed as a highly suc-
cessful alternative to the IBM models. Phrase-based
models generalize the original IBM models by al-
lowing multiple words in one language to corre-
spond to multiple words in another language. For
example, we might have a translation entry specify-
ing that I will in English is a likely translation for Ich
werde in German.
In this paper we use the phrase-based system
of (Koehn et al., 2003) as our underlying model.
This approach first uses the original IBM models
to derive word-to-word alignments in the corpus
of example translations. Heuristics are then used
to grow these alignments to encompass phrase-to-
phrase pairs. The end result of the training process is
a lexicon of phrase-to-phrase pairs, with associated
costs or probabilities. In translation with the sys-
tem, a beam search method with left-to-right search
is used to find a high scoring translation for an in-
put sentence. At each stage of the search, one or
more English words are added to the hypothesized
string, and one or more consecutive German words
are absorbed (i.e., marked as having already been
translatednote that each word is absorbed at most
once). Each step of this kind has a number of costs:
for example, the log probability of the phrase-to-
phrase correspondance involved, the log probability
from a language model, and some distortion score
indicating how likely it is for the proposed words in
the English string to be aligned to the corresponding
position in the German string.

2.1.2 Research on Syntax-Based SMT
</subsubsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.996744815789473">
A number of researchers (Alshawi, 1996; Wu,
1997; Yamada and Knight, 2001; Gildea, 2003;
Melamed, 2004; Graehl and Knight, 2004; Galley
et al., 2004) have proposed models where the trans-
lation process involves syntactic representations of
the source and/or target languages. One class of ap-
proaches make use of bitext grammars which si-
multaneously parse both the source and target lan-
guages. Another class of approaches make use of
syntactic information in the target language alone,
effectively transforming the translation problem into
a parsing problem. Note that these models have radi-
cally different structures and parameterizations from
phrasebased models for SMT. As yet, these sys-
tems have not shown significant gains in accuracy
in comparison to phrase-based systems.
Reranking methods have also been proposed as a
method for using syntactic information (Koehn and
Knight, 2003; Och et al., 2004; Shen et al., 2004). In
these approaches a baseline system is used to gener-
ate -best output. Syntactic features are then used
in a second model that reranks the -best lists, in
an attempt to improve over the baseline approach.
(Koehn and Knight, 2003) apply a reranking ap-
proach to the sub-task of noun-phrase translation.
(Och et al., 2004; Shen et al., 2004) describe the
use of syntactic features in reranking the output of
a full translation system, but the syntactic features
give very small gains: for example the majority of
the gain in performance in the experiments in (Och
et al., 2004) was due to the addition of IBM Model
1 translation probabilities, a non-syntactic feature.
An alternative use of syntactic information is to
employ an existing statistical parsing model as a lan-
guage model within an SMT system. See (Charniak
et al., 2003) for an approach of this form, which
shows improvements in accuracy over a baseline
system.

\x0csearchers (Berger et al., 1996; Niessen and Ney,
2004; Xia and McCord, 2004) have described previ-
ous work on preprocessing methods. (Berger et al.,
1996) describe an approach that targets translation
of French phrases of the form NOUN de NOUN
(e.g., conflit dinteret). This was a relatively lim-
ited study, concentrating on this one syntactic phe-
nomenon which involves relatively local transfor-
mations (a parser was not required in this study).
(Niessen and Ney, 2004) describe a method that
combines morphologicallysplit verbs in German,
and also reorders questions in English and German.
Our method goes beyond this approach in several
respects, for example considering phenomena such
as declarative (non-question) clauses, subordinate
clauses, negation, and so on.
(Xia and McCord, 2004) describe an approach for
translation from French to English, where reorder-
ing rules are acquired automatically. The reorder-
ing rules in their approach operate at the level of
context-free rules in the parse tree. Our method
differs from that of (Xia and McCord, 2004) in a
couple of important respects. First, we are consid-
ering German, which arguably has more challeng-
ing word order phenonema than French. German
has relatively free word order, in contrast to both
English and French: for example, there is consid-
erable flexibility in terms of which phrases can ap-
pear in the first position in a clause. Second, Xia
et. als (2004) use of reordering rules stated at the
context-free level differs from ours. As one exam-
ple, in our approach we use a single transformation
that moves an infinitival verb to the first position in
a verb phrase. Xia et. als approach would require
learning of a different rule transformation for every
production of the form VP =&gt; .... In practice the
German parser that we are using creates relatively
flat structures at the VP and clause levels, leading
to a huge number of context-free rules (the flatness
is one consequence of the relatively free word order
seen within VPs and clauses in German). There are
clearly some advantages to learning reordering rules
automatically, as in Xia et. als approach. How-
ever, we note that our approach involves a hand-
ful of linguisticallymotivated transformations and
achieves comparable improvements (albeit on a dif-
ferent language pair) to Xia et. als method, which
in contrast involves over 56,000 transformations.

2.2 German Clause Structure
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.986171333333333">
In this section we give a brief description of the syn-
tactic structure of German clauses. The character-
istics we describe motivate the reordering rules de-
scribed later in the paper.
Figure 1 gives an example parse tree for a German
sentence. This sentence contains two clauses:
</bodyText>
<construct confidence="0.7179102">
Clause 1: Ich/I werde/will Ihnen/to you die/the
entsprechenden/corresponding
Anmerkungen/comments aushaendigen/pass on
Clause 2: damit/so that Sie/you das/them
eventuell/perhaps bei/in der/the Abstimmung/vote
</construct>
<bodyText confidence="0.954421214285714">
uebernehmen/adopt koennen/can
These two clauses illustrate a number of syntactic
phenomena in German which lead to quite different
word order from English:
Position of finite verbs. In Clause 1, which is a
matrix clause, the finite verb werde is in the second
position in the clause. Finite verbs appear rigidly in
2nd position in matrix clauses. In contrast, in sub-
ordinate clauses, such as Clause 2, the finite verb
comes last in the clause. For example, note that
koennen is a finite verb which is the final element
of Clause 2.
Position of infinitival verbs. In German, infini-
tival verbs are final within their associated verb

\x0cphrase. For example, returning to Figure 1, no-
tice that aushaendigen is the last element in its verb
phrase, and that uebernehmen is the final element of
its verb phrase in the figure.
Relatively flexible word ordering. German has
substantially freer word order than English. In par-
ticular, note that while the verb comes second in ma-
trix clauses, essentially any element can be in the
first position. For example, in Clause 1, while the
subject Ich is seen in the first position, potentially
any of the other constituents (e.g., Ihnen) could also
appear in this position. Note that this often leads
to the subject following the finite verb, something
which happens very rarely in English.
There are many other phenomena which lead to
differing word order between German and English.
Two others that we focus on in this paper are nega-
tion (the differing placement of items such as not in
English and nicht in German), and also verb-particle
constructions. We describe our treatment of these
phenomena later in this paper.

2.3 Reordering with Phrase-Based SMT
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999481173913043">
We have seen in the last section that German syntax
has several characteristics that lead to significantly
different word order from that of English. We now
describe how these characteristics can lead to dif-
ficulties for phrasebased translation systems when
applied to German to English translation.
Typically, reordering models in phrase-based sys-
tems are based solely on movement distance. In par-
ticular, at each point in decoding a cost is associ-
ated with skipping over 1 or more German words.
For example, assume that in translating
Ich werde Ihnen die entsprechenden An-
merkungen aushaendigen.
we have reached a state where Ich and werde
have been translated into I will in English. A
potential decoding decision at this point is to add
the phrase pass on to the English hypothesis, at
the same time absorbing aushaendigen from the
German string. The cost of this decoding step
will involve a number of factors, including a cost
of skipping over a phrase of length 4 (i.e., Ihnen
die entsprechenden Anmerkungen) in the German
string.
The ability to penalise skips of this type, and
the potential to model multi-word phrases, are es-
sentially the main strategies that the phrase-based
system is able to employ when modeling differing
word-order across different languages. In practice,
when training the parameters of an SMT system, for
example using the discriminative methods of (Och,
2003), the cost for skips of this kind is typically set
to a very high value. In experiments with the sys-
tem of (Koehn et al., 2003) we have found that in
practice a large number of complete translations are
completely monotonic (i.e., have skips), suggest-
ing that the system has difficulty learning exactly
what points in the translation should allow reorder-
ing. In summary, phrase-based systems have rela-
tively limited potential to model word-order differ-
ences between different languages.
The reordering stage described in this paper at-
tempts to modify the source language (e.g., German)
in such a way that its word order is very similar to
that seen in the target language (e.g., English). In
an ideal approach, the resulting translation problem
that is passed on to the phrase-based system will be
solvable using a completely monotonic translation,
without any skips, and without requiring extremely
long phrases to be translated (for example a phrasal
translation corresponding to Ihnen die entsprechen-
den Anmerkungen aushaendigen).
Note than an additional benefit of the reordering
phase is that it may bring together groups of words
in German which have a natural correspondance to
phrases in English, but were unseen or rare in the
original German text. For example, in the previous
example, we might derive a correspondance between
werde aushaendigen and will pass on that was not
possible before reordering. Another example con-
cerns verb-particle constructions, for example in
Wir machen die Tuer auf
machen and auf form a verb-particle construction.
The reordering stage moves auf to precede machen,
allowing a phrasal entry that auf machen is trans-
lated to to open in English. Without the reordering,
the particle can be arbitrarily far from the verb that
it modifies, and there is a danger in this example of
translating machen as to make, the natural transla-
tion when no particle is present.

3 Clause Restructuring
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.991711090909091">
We now describe the method we use for reordering
German sentences. As a first step in the reordering
process, we parse the sentence using the parser de-
scribed in (Dubey and Keller, 2003). The second
step is to apply a sequence of rules that reorder the
German sentence depending on the parse tree struc-
ture. See Figure 2 for an example German sentence
before and after the reordering step.
In the reordering phase, each of the following six
restructuring steps were applied to a German parse
tree, in sequence (see table 1 also, for examples of
the reordering steps):
[1] Verb initial In any verb phrase (i.e., phrase
with label VP-...) find the head of the phrase (i.e.,
the child with label -HD) and move it into the ini-
tial position within the verb phrase. For example,
in the parse tree in Figure 1, aushaendigen would be
moved to precede Ihnen in the first verb phrase (VP-
OC), and uebernehmen would be moved to precede
das in the second VP-OC. The subordinate clause
would have the following structure after this trans-
formation:

[5] Infinitives In some cases, infinitival verbs are
still not in the correct position after transformations
[1][4]. For this reason we add a second step that
involves infinitives. First, we remove all internal VP
nodes within the parse tree. Second, for any clause
(i.e., phrase labeled S...), if the clause dominates
both a finite and infinitival verb, and there is an argu-
ment (i.e., a subject, or an object) between the two
verbs, then the infinitive is moved to directly follow
the finite verb.
As an example, the following clause contains an
infinitival (einreichen) that is separated from a finite
verb konnten by the direct object es:

is moved to directly follow the finite verb.

4 Experiments

<bodyText confidence="0.999481727272727">
This section describes experiments with the reorder-
ing approach. Our baseline is the phrase-based
MT system of (Koehn et al., 2003). We trained
this system on the Europarl corpus, which consists
of 751,088 sentence pairs with 15,256,792 German
words and 16,052,269 English words. Translation
performance is measured on a 2000 sentence test set
from a different part of the Europarl corpus, with av-
erage sentence length of 28 words.
We use BLEU scores (Papineni et al., 2002) to
measure translation accuracy. We applied our re-

4.1 Human Translation Judgements
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999677464285714">
We also used human judgements of translation qual-
ity to evaluate the effectiveness of the reordering
rules. We randomly selected 100 sentences from the
test corpus where the English reference translation
was between 10 and 20 words in length.1 For each
of these 100 translations, we presented the two anno-
tators with three translations: the reference (human)
translation, the output from the baseline system, and
the output from the system with reordering. No in-
dication was given as to which system was the base-
line system, and the ordering in which the baseline
and reordered translations were presented was cho-
sen at random on each example, to prevent ordering
effects in the annotators judgements. For each ex-
ample, we asked each of the annotators to make one
of two choices: 1) an indication that one translation
was an improvement over the other; or 2) an indica-
tion that the translations were of equal quality.
Annotator 1 judged 40 translations to be improved
by the reordered model; 40 translations to be of
equal quality; and 20 translations to be worse under
the reordered model. Annotator 2 judged 44 trans-
lations to be improved by the reordered model; 37
translations to be of equal quality; and 19 transla-
tions to be worse under the reordered model. Ta-

ment (and consider all disagreements to fall into the
equal category), then 33 translations improved un-
der the reordering system, and 13 translations be-
came worse. Figure 3 shows a random selection
of the translations where annotator 1 judged the re-
ordered model to give an improvement; Figure 4
shows examples where the baseline system was pre-
ferred by annotator 1. We include these examples to
give a qualitative impression of the differences be-
tween the baseline and reordered system. Our (no
doubt subjective) impression is that the cases in fig-
ure 3 are more clear cut instances of translation im-
provements, but we leave the reader to make his/her
own judgement on this point.

4.2 Statistical Significance
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.9803575">
We now describe statistical significance tests for our
results. We believe that applying significance tests
to Bleu scores is a subtle issue, for this reason we go
into some detail in this section.
We used the sign test (e.g., see page 166 of
(Lehmann, 1986)) to test the statistical significance
of our results. For a source sentence , the sign test
requires a function \x01\x03\x02

We assume that sentences are drawn from
some underlying distribution \x15\x16\x02

We now come to the definition of \x01\x03\x02

how
should we judge whether a translation from one sys-
tem is better or worse than the translation from an-
other system? A critical problem with Bleu scores is
that they are a function of an entire test corpus and
do not give translation scores for single sentences.
Ideally we would have some measure \x01\x02\x01E\x02
\x1c\x04\x04\x03\x06\x05
of the quality of the translation of sentence un-
der the reordered system, and a corresponding func-
tion \x01\x08\x07 \x02

that measures the quality of the baseline
translation. We could then define \x01\x03\x02

work (Koehn, 2004; Zhang and Vogel, 2004) has suggested the
use of bootstrap tests (Efron and Tibshirani, 1993) for the cal-
culation of confidence intervals for Bleu scores. (Koehn, 2004)
gives empirical evidence that these give accurate estimates for
Bleu statistics. However, correctness of the bootstrap method
relies on some technical properties of the statistic (e.g., Bleu
scores) being used (e.g., see (Wasserman, 2004) theorem 8.3);
(Koehn, 2004; Zhang and Vogel, 2004) do not discuss whether
Bleu scores meet any such criteria, which makes us uncertain of
their correctness when applied to Bleu scores.

tions have improved or not under the reordered sys-
tem. Given this definition of \x01\x03\x02

of all test sentences had improved translations un-
der the baseline system, 36.4% of all sentences had
worse translations, and 10.75% of all sentences had
the same quality as before.) If our definition of \x01\x03\x02

was correct, these values for 8 \x18 and 8B\x1f would be
significant at the level \x17 ( 4 \x17 .
We can also calculate confidence intervals for the
results. Define \x15 to be the probability that the re-
ordered system improves on the baseline system,
given that the two systems do not have equal per-
formance. The relative frequency estimate of \x15 is

5 Conclusions
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.99992825">
We have demonstrated that adding knowledge about
syntactic structure can significantly improve the per-
formance of an existing state-of-the-art statistical
machine translation system. Our approach makes
use of syntactic knowledge to overcome a weakness
of tradition SMT systems, namely long-distance re-
ordering. We pose clause restructuring as a prob-
lem for machine translation. Our current approach
is based on hand-crafted rules, which are based on
our linguistic knowledge of how German and En-
glish syntax differs. In the future we may investigate
data-driven approaches, in an effort to learn reorder-
ing models automatically. While our experiments
are on German, other languages have word orders
that are very different from English, so we believe
our methods will be generally applicable.

<abstract confidence="0.996073266666667">We describe a method for incorporating syntactic information in statistical machine translation systems. The first step of the method is to parse the source language string that is being translated. The second step is to apply a series of transformations to the parse tree, effectively reordering the surface string on the source language side of the translation system. The goal of this step is to recover an underlying word order that is closer to the target language word-order than the original string. The reordering approach is applied as a pre-processing step in both the training and decoding phases of a phrase-based statistical MT system. We describe experiments on translation from German to English, showing an improvement from 25.2% Bleu score for a baseline system to 26.8% Bleu score for the system with reordering, a statistically significant improvement.</abstract>

For this reason there is currently a great deal of interest in methods which incorporate syntactic information within statistical machine translation systems (e.g., see (Alshawi, 1996; Wu, 1997; Yamada and Knight, 2001; Gildea, 2003; Melamed, 2004; Graehl and Knight, 2004; Och et al., 2004; Xia and McCord, 2004)).

We describe experiments on translation from German to English, showing an improvement from 25.2% Bleu score for a baseline system to 26.8% Bleu score for the system with reordering, a statistically significant improvement. 1 Introduction Recent research on statistical machine translation (SMT) has lead to the development of phrasebased systems (Och et al., 1999; Marcu and Wong, 2002; Koehn et al., 2003). These methods go beyond the original IBM machine translation models (Brown et al., 1993), by allowing multi-word units (phrases) in one language to be translated directly into phrases in another language. A number of empirical evaluations have suggested that phrase-based systems currently represent the stateoftheart in statistical machine translation. In spite of their success, a key limitation of phrase-based systems is that they make little or no direct use of syntactic information.

Source language sentences are reordered in test data, and also in training data that is used by the underlying phrasebased system. Results using the method show an improvement from 25.2% Bleu score to 26.8% Bleu score (a statistically significant improvement), using a phrase-based system (Koehn et al., 2003) which has been shown in the past to be a highly competitive SMT system. 2 Background 2.1 Previous Work 2.1.1 Research on Phrase-Based SMT The original work on statistical machine translation was carried out by researchers at IBM (Brown et al., 1993). More recently, phrase-based models (Och et al., 1999; Marcu and Wong, 2002; Koehn et al., 2003) have been proposed as a highly successful alternative to the IBM models. Phrase-based models generalize the original IBM models by allowing multiple words in one language to correspond to multiple words in another language. For example, we might have a translation entry specifying that I will in English is a likely translation for Ich werde in German. In this paper we use the phrase-based system of (Koehn et al., 2003) as our underlying model. This approach first uses the original IBM models to de</context>

As a first step in the reordering process, we parse the sentence using the parser described in (Dubey and Keller, 2003). The second step is to apply a sequence of rules that reorder the German sentence depending on the parse tree structure. See Figure 2 for an example German sentence before and after the reordering step. In the reordering phase, each of the following six restructuring steps were applied to a German parse tree, in sequence (see table 1 also, for examples of the reordering steps): [1] Verb initial In any verb phrase (i.e., phrase with label VP-...) find the head of the phrase (i.e., the child with label -HD) and move it into the initial position within the verb phrase.

The reordering rules in their approach operate at the level of context-free rules in the parse tree. Our method differs from that of (Xia and McCord, 2004) in a couple of important respects. First, we are considering German, which arguably has more challenging word order phenonema than French. German has relatively free word order, in contrast to both English and French: for example, there is considerable flexibility in terms of which phrases can appear in the first position in a clause. Second, Xia et. als (2004) use of reordering rules stated at the context-free level differs from ours. As one example, in our approach we use a single transformation that moves an infinitival verb to the first position in a verb phrase. Xia et. als approach would require learning of a different rule transformation for every production of the form VP =&gt; .... In practice the German parser that we are using creates relatively flat structures at the VP and clause levels, leading to a huge number of context-free rules (the flatness is one consequence of the relatively free word order seen within VPs and clauses in German). </context>

English translation: I will pass on to you the corresponding comments, so that you can adopt them perhaps in the vote. 531 \x0cWe applied our approach to translation from German to English in the Europarl corpus. Source language sentences are reordered in test data, and also in training data that is used by the underlying phrasebased system. Results using the method show an improvement from 25.2% Bleu score to 26.8% Bleu score (a statistically significant improvement), using a phrase-based system (Koehn et al., 2003) which has been shown in the past to be a highly competitive SMT system. 2 Background 2.1 Previous Work 2.1.1 Research on Phrase-Based SMT The original work on statistical machine translation was carried out by researchers at IBM (Brown et al., 1993).

The ability to penalise skips of this type, and the potential to model multi-word phrases, are essentially the main strategies that the phrase-based system is able to employ when modeling differing word-order across different languages. In practice, when training the parameters of an SMT system, for example using the discriminative methods of (Och, 2003), the cost for skips of this kind is typically set to a very high value. In experiments with the system of (Koehn et al., 2003) we have found that in practice a large number of complete translations are completely monotonic (i.e., have skips), suggesting that the system has difficulty learning exactly what points in the translation should allow reordering. In summary, phrase-based systems have relatively limited potential to model word-order differences between different languages. The reordering stage described in this paper attempts to modify the source language (e.g., German) in such a way that its word order is very similar to that seen in the target language (e.g., English).

We believe that applying significance tests to Bleu scores is a subtle issue, for this reason we go into some detail in this section. We used the sign test (e.g., see page 166 of (Lehmann, 1986)) to test the statistical significance of our results.

In spite of their success, a key limitation of phrase-based systems is that they make little or no direct use of syntactic information. It appears likely that syntactic information will be crucial in accurately modeling many phenomena during translation, for example systematic differences between the word order of different languages. For this reason there is currently a great deal of interest in methods which incorporate syntactic information within statistical machine translation systems (e.g., see (Alshawi, 1996; Wu, 1997; Yamada and Knight, 2001; Gildea, 2003; Melamed, 2004; Graehl and Knight, 2004; Och et al., 2004; Xia and McCord, 2004)). In this paper we describe an approach for the use of syntactic information within phrase-based SMT systems. The approach constitutes a simple, direct method for the incorporation of syntactic information in a phrasebased system, which we will show leads to significant improvements in translation accuracy. The first step of the method is to parse the source language string that is being translated. The second step is to apply a series of transformations to the resulting parse tree, effectively reordering the surface string on </context>

Each step of this kind has a number of costs: for example, the log probability of the phrase-tophrase correspondance involved, the log probability from a language model, and some distortion score indicating how likely it is for the proposed words in the English string to be aligned to the corresponding position in the German string. 2.1.2 Research on Syntax-Based SMT A number of researchers (Alshawi, 1996; Wu, 1997; Yamada and Knight, 2001; Gildea, 2003; Melamed, 2004; Graehl and Knight, 2004; Galley et al., 2004) have proposed models where the translation process involves syntactic representations of the source and/or target languages. One class of approaches make use of bitext grammars which simultaneously parse both the source and target languages.

See (Charniak et al., 2003) for an approach of this form, which shows improvements in accuracy over a baseline system. 2.1.3 Research on Preprocessing Approaches Our approach involves a preprocessing step, where sentences in the language being translated are modified before being passed to an existing phrasebased translation system.

This was a relatively limited study, concentrating on this one syntactic phenomenon which involves relatively local transformations (a parser was not required in this study).

If our definition of \x01\x03\x02 \x05\x04 was correct, these values for 8 \x18 and 8B\x1f would be significant at the level \x17 ( 4 \x17 . We can also calculate confidence intervals for the results. Define \x15 to be the probability that the reordered system improves on the baseline system, given that the two systems do not have equal performance.

Our approach makes use of syntactic knowledge to overcome a weakness of tradition SMT systems, namely long-distance reordering. We pose clause restructuring as a problem for machine translation.

In spite of their success, a key limitation of phrase-based systems is that they make little or no direct use of syntactic information. It appears likely that syntactic information will be crucial in accurately modeling many phenomena during translation, for example systematic differences between the word order of different languages. For this reason there is currently a great deal of interest in methods which incorporate syntactic information within statistical machine translation systems (e.g., see (Alshawi, 1996; Wu, 1997; Yamada and Knight, 2001; Gildea, 2003; Melamed, 2004; Graehl and Knight, 2004; Och et al., 2004; Xia and McCord, 2004)).

An alternative use of syntactic information is to employ an existing statistical parsing model as a language model within an SMT system. See (Charniak et al., 2003) for an approach of this form, which shows improvements in accuracy over a baseline system. 2.1.3 Research on Preprocessing Approaches Our approach involves a preprocessing step, where sentences in the language being translated are modified before being passed to an existing phrasebased translation system. A number of other re532 \x0csearchers (Berger et al., 1996; Niessen and Ney, 2004; Xia and McCord, 2004) have described previous work on preprocessing methods. (Berger et al., 1996) describe an approach that targets translation of French phrases of the form NOUN de NOUN (e.g., conflit dinteret). This was a relatively limited study, concentrating on this one syntactic phenomenon which involves relatively local transformations (a parser was not required in this study). (Niessen and Ney, 2004) describe a method that combines morphologicallysplit verbs in German, and also reorders questions in English and German.
