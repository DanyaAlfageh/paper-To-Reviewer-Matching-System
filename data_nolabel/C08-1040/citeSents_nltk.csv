We used the model described in CITATION for this purpose.,,
The model presented in this paper assumes that the probabilities of a document belonging to a certain topic varies smoothly over time and the words within a given document have exactly the same probability of being drawn from a particular topic CITATION.,,
These two properties make the model different than standard mixture models CITATION and the latent Dirichlet allocation model of CITATION.,,
The model of CITATION is most closely related to the model of CITATION, who present a generalization of the model used by CITATION.,,

Degree centrality, closeness, and betweenness CITATION are among the most known methods for measuring centrality of nodes in a network.,,

In CITATION, a network analysis of the members and committees of the US House of Representatives is performed.,,
To help the random walker escape from periodic or disconnected components, CITATION suggests reserving a small escape probability at each node that represents a chance of jumping to any node in the graph, making the Markov chain irreducible and aperiodic, which guarantees the existence of the eigenvector.,,
Equation (4) can then be rewritten, assuming a uniform escape probability, as: p = p[dU + (1 d)B] (6) where N is the total number of nodes, U is a square matrix with U(i, j) = 1/N for all i, j, and d is the escape probability chosen in the interval [0.1, 0.2] CITATION.,,
