This type of algorithm creates many false positives, which are not filtered out by the dependency paths employed in the algorithm by CITATION,,
CITATION also observe that movie reviews are different from e.g,,
A more linguistically motivated approach was taken by CITATION through identifying opinion holders and targets with semantic role labeling,,
CITATION describe a collection of product reviews in which anaphoric opinion targets are also annotated, but it is not available to the public (yet),,
Although CITATION present a machine-learning based algorithm for AR, they evaluate its performance in comparison to three non machine-learning based algorithms, since those are the only ones available,,
An interesting insight was gained from the document level sentiment analysis on movie reviews in comparison to documents from other domains: CITATION observes that the movie reviews are hardest to classify since the review authors tend to give information about the storyline of the movie which often contain characterizations, such as bad guy or violent scene,,
2.2 Opinion Mining on Movie Reviews There is a huge body of work on OM in movie reviews which was sparked by the dataset from CITATION,,
The algorithm with the next-to-highest results in (Charniak and Elsner, 2009) is MARS CITATION from the GuiTAR CITATION toolkit,,
CITATION present an algorithm for the extraction of opinion target - opinion word pairs,,
This is reflected in their experiments, in which their system outperforms the system by CITATION which attributes an opinion target to the opinion word which is closest regarding,,

3 Opinion Target Identification 3.1 Dataset Currently the only freely available dataset annotated with opinions including annotated anaphoric opinion targets is a corpus of movie reviews by CITATION,,
This is reflected in their experiments, in which their system outperforms the system by CITATION which attributes an opinion target to the opinion word which is closest regarding word distance in a sentence,,
5.1 Error Analysis When extracting opinions from movie reviews, we observe the same challenge as CITATION: The users often characterize events in the storyline or roles the characters play,,
The algorithm by CITATION identifies coreferring targets in newspaper articles,,
To reproduce the system by CITATION, we substitute the cast and crew list employed by them (see Section 3.2), with a NER component CITATION,,
One aspect regarding the extraction of opinion target - opinion word pairs remains open in CITATION: The dependency paths only identify connections between pairs of single words,,
CITATION also observe that m,,
As shown in Table 3, the recall of our reimplementation is slightly higher than the recall reported in CITATION,,
4 Algorithms for Anaphora Resolution As pointed out by CITATION there are hardly any freely available systems for AR,,
The relevance ranking and extraction was then performed with different statistical measures: Pointwise Mutual Information CITATION, the Likelihood Ratio Test CITATION and Association Mining CITATION,,
Table 1: Dataset Statistics # Documents 1829 # Sentences 24918 # Tokens 273715 # Target + Opinion Pairs 5298 # Targets which are Pronouns 504 # Pronouns &gt; 11000 3.2 Baseline Opinion Mining We reimplemented the algorithm presented by CITATION as the baseline for our 1 http://www.imdb.com (IMDB) 264 \x0cTable 2: Pronouns as Opinion Targets it 274 he 58 she 22 they 22 this 77 his 26 her 10 him 15 experiments,,
CITATION do not explain how they extract multiword opinion targets with the dependency paths,,
It is not a marginal phenomenon, since CITATION report that in their data, 14% of the opinion targets are pronouns,,
We therefore suggest three extensions to the algorithm which are on the one hand possible in the OM setting and on the other hand represent special features of the target discourse type: [1.] We observed that the Stanford Named Entity Recognizer CITATION is superior to the Person detection of the (MUC6 trained) CogNIAC implementation,,
The extraction of such anaphoric opinion targets has been noted as an open issue multiple times in the OM context (CITATION; CITATION; CITATION),,
CITATION successfully modified the relevance ranking of terms in their documents by replacing anaphora with their antecedents,,
CITATION used a subset of the dataset they published (1829 documents), namely 1100 documents, however they do not state which documents comprise this subset used in their evaluation,,
The CogNIAC algorithm CITATION was designed for high-precision AR,,
Furthermore, CITATION do not state whether in their evaluation annotated multiw,,
 by the dataset from CITATION,,
The approach can be taken for OM algorithms which select the opinion target candidates with a relevance ranking (CITATION; CITATION),,
