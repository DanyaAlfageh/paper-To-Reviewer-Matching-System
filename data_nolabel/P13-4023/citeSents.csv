While the classes are picked from the YAGO type system, the approach is generic and can be applied to derive type taxonomies from other knowledge bases such as Freebase or DBpedia CITATION as in CITATION,,
CITATION is one of the earliest approaches to perform entity classification into subtypes of PERSON,,
2 Entity Type Classification Systems State-of-the-art tools for named entity recognition such as the Stanford NER Tagger CITATION compute semantic tags only for a small set of coarse-grained types: Person, Location, and Organization (plus tags for non-entity phrases of type time, money, percent, and date),,
The most common workaround to perform entity classification is a two-stage process: in first applying an online tool for Named-Entity Disambiguation (NED), such as DBpedia Spotlight CITATION or AIDA (CITATION; CITATION), in order to map the mentions onto canonical entities and subsequently query the knowledge base for their types,,
In fact, CITATION followed this approach when comparing their entity classification system results against those obtained by an adoption of the Illinois Named-Entity Linking system (NEL) CITATION and reached the conclusion that while NEL performed decently for prominent entities, it could not scale to cover long tail ones,,
ems State-of-the-art tools for named entity recognition such as the Stanford NER Tagger CITATION compute semantic tags only for a small set of coarse-grained types: Person, Location, and Organization (plus tags for non-entity phrases of type time, money, percent, and date),,
So we face a hierarchical multi-label classification problem CITATION,,

Altaf ur Rahman and CITATION) considered a two-level type hierarchy consisting of 29 top-level classes and a total of 92 sub-classes,,
(Altaf ur Rahman and CITATION) considered a two-level type hierarchy consisting of 29 top-level classes and a total of 92 sub-classes,,
CITATION considered 141 subtypes of WordNet class PERSON and deve,,
The YAGO knowledge base CITATION is selected to derive the taxonomy from because of its highly precise classification of entities into WordNet classes, which is a result of the accurate mapping YAGO has from Wikipedia Categories to WordNet synsets,,
CITATION developed FIGER, which classifies entity mentions onto a two-level taxonomy based on the Freebase knowledge base CITATION,,
The most common workaround to perform entity classification is a two-stage process: in first applying an online tool for Named-Entity Disambiguation (NED), such as DBpedia Spotlight CITATION or AIDA (CITATION; CITATION), in order to map the mentions onto canonical entities and subsequen,,

 tools for named entity recognition such as the Stanford NER Tagger CITATION compute semantic tags only for a small set of coarse-grained types: Person, Location, and Organization (plus tags for non-entity phrases of type time, money, percent, and date),,
CITATION considered 141 subtypes of WordNet class PERSON and developed a maximum entropy classifier exploiting the words surrounding the mentions together with their POS tags and other contextual features,,
CITATION is the most recent work in multi-label type classification,,
