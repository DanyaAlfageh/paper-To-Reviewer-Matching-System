A common approach is to extract word-internal features from unknown words, for example suffix, capitalization, or punctuation features (CITATION, CITATION, CITATION),,
Sequence-sensitive features can be included by chaining our local classifiers together and performing joint inference, i.e., by building a conditional markov model (CMM), also known as a maximum entropy markov model CITATION,,
Indeed, the character emission model in this section is directly based on the \x04 -gram proper-name classification engine described in CITATION,,
Finally, in section 4 we add additional features to the maxent model, and chain these models into a conditional markov model (CMM), as used for tagging CITATION or earlier NER work CITATION,,
Earlier papers have taken a character-level approach to named entity recognition (NER), notably CITATION, which used prefix and suffix tries, though to our knowledge incorporating all character \x04 - grams is new,,
