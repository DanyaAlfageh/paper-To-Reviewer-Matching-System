<bodyText confidence="0.998958333333333">
Negation is present in all human languages
and it is used to reverse the polarity of part
of statements that are otherwise affirmative by
default. A negated statement often carries pos-
itive implicit meaning, but to pinpoint the pos-
itive part from the negative part is rather dif-
ficult. This paper aims at thoroughly repre-
senting the semantics of negation by revealing
implicit positive meaning. The proposed rep-
resentation relies on focus of negation detec-
tion. For this, new annotation over PropBank
and a learning algorithm are proposed.

1 Introduction

<bodyText confidence="0.995635245283019">
Understanding the meaning of text is a long term
goal in the natural language processing commu-
nity. Whereas philosophers and linguists have pro-
posed several theories, along with models to rep-
resent the meaning of text, the field of computa-
tional linguistics is still far from doing this automati-
cally. The ambiguity of language, the need to detect
implicit knowledge, and the demand for common-
sense knowledge and reasoning are a few of the dif-
ficulties to overcome. Substantial progress has been
made, though, especially on detection of semantic
relations, ontologies and reasoning methods.
Negation is present in all languages and it is al-
ways the case that statements are affirmative by
default. Negation is marked and it typically sig-
nals something unusual or an exception. It may
be present in all units of language, e.g., words
(incredible), clauses (He doesnt have friends).
Negation and its correlates (truth values, lying,
irony, false or contradictory statements) are exclu-
sive characteristics of humans (Horn, 1989; Horn
and Kato, 2000).
Negation is fairly well-understood in grammars;
the valid ways to express a negation are documented.
However, there has not been extensive research on
detecting it, and more importantly, on representing
the semantics of negation. Negation has been largely
ignored within the area of semantic relations.
At first glance, one would think that interpreting
negation could be reduced to finding negative key-
words, detect their scope using syntactic analysis
and reverse its polarity. Actually, it is more com-
plex. Negation plays a remarkable role in text un-
derstanding and it poses considerable challenges.
Detecting the scope of negation in itself is chal-
lenging: All vegetarians do not eat meat means that
vegetarians do not eat meat and yet All that glitters
is not gold means that it is not the case that all that
glitters is gold (so out of all things that glitter, some
are gold and some are not). In the former example,
the universal quantifier all has scope over the nega-
tion; in the latter, the negation has scope over all.
In logic, two negatives always cancel each other
out. On the other hand, in language this is only theo-
retically the case: she is not unhappy does not mean
that she is happy; it means that she is not fully un-
happy, but she is not happy either.
Some negated statements carry a positive implicit
meaning. For example, cows do not eat meat implies
that cows eat something other than meat. Otherwise,
the speaker would have stated cows do not eat. A
clearer example is the correct and yet puzzling state-
ment tables do not eat meat. This sentence sounds
</bodyText>

581
</page>
<bodyText confidence="0.988067888888889">
\x0cunnatural because of the underlying positive state-
ment (i.e., tables eat something other than meat).
Negation can express less than or in between
when used in a scalar context. For example, John
does not have three children probably means that he
has either one or two children. Contrasts may use
negation to disagree about a statement and not to
negate it, e.g., That place is not big, it is massive
defines the place as massive, and therefore, big.

Negation has been widely studied outside of com-
putational linguistics. In logic, negation is usu-
ally the simplest unary operator and it reverses the
truth value. The seminal work by Horn (1989)
presents the main thoughts in philosophy and psy-
chology. Linguists have found negation a complex
phenomenon; Huddleston and Pullum (2002) ded-
icate over 60 pages to it. Negation interacts with
quantifiers and anaphora (Hintikka, 2002), and in-
fluences reasoning (Dowty, 1994; Sanchez Valencia,
1991). Zeijlstra (2007) analyzes the position and
form of negative elements and negative concords.
Rooth (1985) presented a theory of focus in his
dissertation and posterior publications (e.g., Rooth
(1992)). In this paper, we follow the insights on
scope and focus of negation by Huddleston and Pul-
lum (2002) rather than Rooths (1985).
Within natural language processing, negation
has drawn attention mainly in sentiment analysis
(Wilson et al., 2009; Wiegand et al., 2010) and
the biomedical domain. Recently, the Negation
and Speculation in NLP Workshop (Morante and
Sporleder, 2010) and the CoNLL-2010 Shared Task
(Farkas et al., 2010) targeted negation mostly on
those subfields. Morante and Daelemans (2009) and
Ozgur and Radev (2009) propose scope detectors
using the BioScope corpus. Councill et al. (2010)
present a supervised scope detector using their own
annotation. Some NLP applications deal indirectly
with negation, e.g., machine translation (van Mun-
ster, 1988), text classification (Rose et al., 2003) and
recognizing entailments (Bos and Markert, 2005).
Regarding corpora, the BioScope corpus anno-
tates negation marks and linguistic scopes exclu-
sively on biomedical texts. It does not annotate fo-
cus and it purposely ignores negations such as (talk-
ing about the reaction of certain elements) in NK3.3
cells is not always identical (Vincze et al., 2008),
which carry the kind of positive meaning this work
aims at extracting (in NK3.3 cells is often identi-
cal). PropBank (Palmer et al., 2005) only indicates
the verb to which a negation mark attaches; it does
not provide any information about the scope or fo-
cus. FrameNet (Baker et al., 1998) does not con-
sider negation and FactBank (Saur and Pustejovsky,
2009) only annotates degrees of factuality for events.
None of the above references aim at detecting or
annotating the focus of negation in natural language.
Neither do they aim at carefully representing the
meaning of negated statements nor extracting im-
plicit positive meaning from them.

Simply put, negation is a process that turns a state-
ment into its opposite. Unlike affirmative state-
ments, negation is marked by words (e.g., not, no,
never) or affixes (e.g., -nt, un-). Negation can inter-
act with other words in special ways. For example,
negated clauses use different connective adjuncts
that positive clauses do: neither, nor instead of ei-
ther, or. The so-called negatively-oriented polarity-
sensitive items (Huddleston and Pullum, 2002) in-
clude, among many others, words starting with any-
(anybody, anyone, anywhere, etc.), the modal aux-
iliaries dare and need and the grammatical units at
all, much and till. Negation in verbs usually requires
an auxiliary; if none is present, the auxiliary do is in-
serted (I read the paper vs. I didnt read the paper).

State-of-the-art semantic role labelers (e.g., the ones

John didnt build a house to impress Mary, they en-

existence of positive meaning. Examples (5, 9) fur-

similar (both have AGENT, THEME and MANNER)

that (8, 9) do not carry any positive meaning; even
though their interpretations do not contain a verbal
negation, the meaning remains negative. Some ex-
amples could be interpreted differently depending
on the context (Section 4.2.1).
This paper aims at thoroughly representing the se-
mantics of negation by revealing implicit positive
meaning. The main contributions are: (1) interpre-
tation of negation using focus detection; (2) focus of
negation annotation over all PropBank negated sen-
tences1; (3) feature set to detect the focus of nega-
tion; and (4) model to semantically represent nega-
tion and reveal its underlying positive meaning.

3.2 Negation Types
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.9593769">
Huddleston and Pullum (2002) distinguish four con-
trasts for negation:
Verbal if the marker of negation is grammati-
cally associated with the verb (I did not see any-
thing at all); non-verbal if it is associated with a
dependent of the verb (I saw nothing at all).
Analytic if the sole function of the negated
mark is to mark negation (Bill did not go);
synthetic if it has some other function as well
([Nobody]AGENT went to the meeting).

Clausal if the negation yields a negative clause
(She didnt have a large income); subclausal oth-
erwise (She had a not inconsiderable income).
Ordinary if it indicates that something is not the
case, e.g., (1) She didnt have lunch with my
old man: he couldnt make it; metalinguistic if
it does not dispute the truth but rather reformu-
lates a statement, e.g., (2) She didnt have lunch
with your old man: she had lunch with your fa-
ther. Note that in (1) the lunch never took place,
whereas in (2) a lunch did take place.
In this paper, we focus on verbal, analytic, clausal,
and both metalinguistic and ordinary negation.

<subsectionHeader confidence="0.994292">
3.3 Scope and Focus
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.9672336">
Negation has both scope and focus and they are ex-
tremely important to capture its semantics. Scope is
the part of the meaning that is negated. Focus is that
part of the scope that is most prominently or explic-
itly negated (Huddleston and Pullum, 2002).
Both concepts are tightly connected. Scope corre-
sponds to all elements any of whose individual fal-
sity would make the negated statement true. Focus
is the element of the scope that is intended to be in-
terpreted as false to make the overall negative true.
Consider (1) Cows dont eat meat and its positive
counterpart (2) Cows eat meat. The truth conditions
of (2) are: (a) somebody eats something; (b) cows
are the ones who eat; and (c) meat is what is eaten.
In order for (2) to be true, (ac) have to be true.
And the falsity of any of them is sufficient to make
(1) true. In other words, (1) would be true if nobody
eats, cows dont eat or meat is not eaten. Therefore,
all three statements (ac) are inside the scope of (1).
The focus is more difficult to identify, especially

without knowing stress or intonation. Text under-
standing is needed and context plays an important
role. The most probable focus for (1) is meat, which
corresponds to the interpretation cows eat something
else than meat. Another possible focus is cows,
which yields someone eats meat, but not cows.
Both scope and focus are primarily semantic,
highly ambiguous and context-dependent. More ex-
amples can be found in Tables 1 and 3 and (Huddle-
ston and Pullum, 2002, Chap. 9).
4 Approach to Semantic Representation of
Negation
Negation does not stand on its own. To be useful, it
should be added as part of another existing knowl-
edge representation. In this Section, we outline how
to incorporate negation into semantic relations.
</bodyText>
<subsectionHeader confidence="0.997696">
4.1 Semantic Relations
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.933682692307692">
Semantic relations capture connections between
concepts and label them according to their nature.
It is out of the scope of this paper to define them
in depth, establish a set to consider or discuss their
detection. Instead, we use generic semantic roles.
Given s: The cow didnt eat grass with a fork,
typical semantic roles encode AGENT(the cow, eat),
THEME(grass, eat), INSTRUMENT(with a fork, eat)
and NEGATION(nt, eat). This representation only
differs on the last relation from the positive counter-
part. Its interpretation is it is not the case that s.
Several options arise to thoroughly represent s.
First, we find it useful to consider the seman-
tic representation of the affirmative counterpart:
AGENT(the cow, ate), THEME(grass, ate), and IN-
STRUMENT(with a fork, ate). Second, we believe
detecting the focus of negation is useful. Even
though it is open to discussion, the focus corre-
sponds to INSTRUMENT(with a fork, ate) Thus, the
negated statement should be interpreted as the cow
ate grass, but it did not do so using a fork.
Table 2 depicts five different possible semantic
representations. Option (1) does not incorporate any
explicit representation of negation. It attaches the
negated mark and auxiliary to eat; the negation is
part of the relation arguments. This option fails
to detect any underlying positive meaning and cor-
responds to the interpretation the cow did not eat,
grass was not eaten and a fork was not used to eat.
Options (25) embody negation into the represen-
tation with the pseudo-relation NOT. NOT takes as its
argument an instantiated relation or set of relations
and indicates that they do not hold.
Option (2) includes all the scope as the argument
of NOT and corresponds to the interpretation it is not
the case that the cow ate grass with a fork. Like typi-
cal semantic roles, option (2) does not reveal the im-
plicit positive meaning carried by statement s. Op-
tions (35) encode different interpretations:
</bodyText>
<listItem confidence="0.980838">
(3) negates the AGENT; it corresponds to the cow
didnt eat, but grass was eaten with a fork.
(4) applies NOT to the THEME; it corresponds to
the cow ate something with a fork, but not grass.
(5) denies the INSTRUMENT, encoding the mean-

<bodyText confidence="0.988688428571429">
ing the cow ate grass, but it did not use a fork.
Option (5) is preferred since it captures the best
implicit positive meaning. It corresponds to the se-
mantic representation of the affirmative counterpart
after applying the pseudo-relation NOT over the fo-
cus of the negation. This fact justifies and motivates
the detection of the focus of negation.

4.2 Annotating the Focus of Negation
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999352875">
Due to the lack of corpora containing annotation for
focus of negation, new annotation is needed. An ob-
vious option is to add it to any text collection. How-
ever, building on top of publicly available resources
is a better approach: they are known by the commu-
nity, they contain useful information for detecting
the focus of negation and tools have already been
developed to predict their annotation.

We decided to work over PropBank. Unlike other
resources (e.g., FrameNet), gold syntactic trees are
available. Compared to the BioScope corpus, Prop-
Bank provides semantic annotation and is not lim-
ited to the biomedical domain. On top of that, there
has been active research on predicting PropBank
roles for years. The additional annotation can be
readily used by any system trained with PropBank,

<bodyText confidence="0.99148264516129">
The focus of a negation involving verb v is resolved
as:
If it cannot be inferred that an action v oc-
curred, focus is role MNEG.
Otherwise, focus is the role that is most promi-
nently negated.
All decisions are made considering as context the
previous and next sentence. The mark -NOT is used
to indicate the focus. Consider the following state-
ment (file wsj 2282, sentence 16).
[While profitable]MADV1,2 , [it]A11 ,A02 was[nt]MNEG1
[growing]v1 and was[nt]MNEG2 [providing]v2 [a sat-

The previous sentence is Applied, then a closely
held company, was stagnating under the manage-
ment of its controlling family. Regarding the first
verb (growing), one cannot infer that anything was
growing, so focus is MNEG. For the second verb
(providing), it is implicitly stated that the company
was providing a not satisfactory return on invest-
ment, therefore, focus is A1.
The guidelines assume that the focus corresponds
to a single role or the verb. In cases where more than
one role could be selected, the most likely focus is
chosen; context and text understanding are key. We
define the most likely focus as the one that yields the
most meaningful implicit information.
For example, in (Table 3, example 2) [He]A0
could be chosen as focus, yielding someone can
stomach the taste of Heinz, but not him. However,

clear that the best option is A1. Example (5) has a
similar ambiguity between A0 and A2, example (9)
between MTMP and A4, etc. The role that yields the
most useful positive implicit information given the
context is always chosen as focus.
Table 3 provides several examples having as their
focus different roles. Example (1) does not carry
any positive meaning, the focus is V. In (210) the
verb must be interpreted as affirmative, as well as
all roles except the one marked with (i.e., the
focus). For each example, we provide PropBank an-
notation (top), the new annotation (i.e., the focus,
bottom right) and its interpretation (bottom left).

<subsubsectionHeader confidence="0.850125">
4.2.2 Interpretation of -NOT
</subsubsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.998568">
The mark -NOT is interpreted as follows:
If MNEG-NOT(x, y), then verb y must be
negated; the statement does not carry positive
meaning.
If any other role is marked with -NOT, ROLE-
NOT(x, y) must be interpreted as it is not the
case that x is ROLE of y.
Unmarked roles are interpreted positive; they cor-
respond to implicit positive meaning. Role labels
(A0, MTMP, etc.) maintain the same meaning from
PropBank (Palmer et al., 2005). MNEG can be ig-
nored since it is overwritten by -NOT.
The new annotation for the example (Figure 1)
must be interpreted as: While profitable, it (the com-
pany) was not growing and was providing a not sat-
isfactory return on investment. Paraphrasing, While
profitable, it was shrinking or idle and was providing
an unsatisfactory return on investment. We discover
an entailment and an implicature respectively.

tic labels provided by PropBank.
As annotation tool, we use Jubilee (Choi et al.,
2010). For each instance, annotators decide the fo-
cus given the full syntactic tree, as well as the previ-
ous and next sentence. A post-processing step incor-
porates focus annotation to the original PropBank by
adding -NOT to the corresponding role.
In a first round, 50% of instances were annotated
twice. Inter-annotator agreement was 0.72. After
careful examination of the disagreements, they were
resolved and annotators were given clearer instruc-
tions. The main point of conflict was selecting a fo-
cus that yields valid implicit meaning, but not the
most valuable (Section 4.2.1). Due to space con-
straints, we cannot elaborate more on this issue. The
remaining instances were annotated once. Table 4
depicts counts for each role.

<bodyText confidence="0.989626181818182">
The BASIC baseline obtains a respectable accuracy
of 61.38 (Table 6). Most errors correspond to in-
stances having as focus the two most likely foci: A1
and MNEG (Table 4). We improve BASIC with an
extended feature set which targets especially A1 and
the verb (Table 5).
Features (15) are extracted for each role and
capture their presence, first POS tag and word,
length and position within the roles present for
that instance. Features (68) further characterize
A1. A1-postag is extracted for the following
POS tags: DT, JJ, PRP, CD, RB, VB and WP;
A1-keyword for the following words: any, any-
body, anymore, anyone, anything, anytime, any-
where, certain, enough, full, many, much, other,
some, specifics, too and until. These lists of POS
tags and keywords were extracted after manual ex-
amination of training examples and aim at signaling
whether this role correspond to the focus. Examples
of A1 corresponding to the focus and including one
of the POS tags or keywords are:

Features (1116) correspond to the main verb.
VP-words (VP-postag) captures the full se-
quence of words (POS tags) from the beginning of
the VP until the main verb. Features (1516) check
for POS tags as the presence of certain tags usually
signal that the verb is not the focus of negation (e.g.,

Features (1722) tackle the predicate, which in-
cludes the main verb and may include other words
(typically prepositions). We consider the words in
the predicate, as well as the specific thematic roles
for each numbered argument. This is useful since
PropBank uses different numbered arguments for
the same thematic role depending on the frame (e.g.,
A3 is used as PURPOSE in authorize.01 and as IN-
STRUMENT in avert.01).

7 Conclusions
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999391346153846">
In this paper, we present a novel way to semantically
represent negation using focus detection. Implicit
positive meaning is identified, giving a thorough in-
terpretation of negated statements.
Due to the lack of corpora annotating the focus of
negation, we have added this information to all the
negations marked with MNEG in PropBank. A set
of features is depicted and a supervised model pro-
posed. The task is highly ambiguous and semantic
features have proven helpful.
A verbal negation is interpreted by considering all
roles positive except the one corresponding to the
focus. This has proven useful as shown in several
examples. In some cases, though, it is not easy to
obtain the meaning of a negated role.
Consider (Table 3, example 5) P&amp;G hasnt sold
coffee::
to::::::::
airlines. The proposed representation en-
codes P&amp;G has sold coffee, but not to airlines. How-
ever, it is not said that the buyers are likely to have
been other kinds of companies. Even without fully
identifying the buyer, we believe it is of utmost im-
portance to detect that P&amp;G has sold coffee. Empir-
ical data (Table 4) shows that over 65% of negations
in PropBank carry implicit positive meaning.

<abstract confidence="0.99955">Negation is present in all human languages and it is used to reverse the polarity of part of statements that are otherwise affirmative by default. A negated statement often carries positive implicit meaning, but to pinpoint the positive part from the negative part is rather difficult. This paper aims at thoroughly representing the semantics of negation by revealing implicit positive meaning. The proposed representation relies on focus of negation detection. For this, new annotation over PropBank and a learning algorithm are proposed.</abstract>

Substantial progress has been made, though, especially on detection of semantic relations, ontologies and reasoning methods. Negation is present in all languages and it is always the case that statements are affirmative by default. Negation is marked and it typically signals something unusual or an exception. It may be present in all units of language, e.g., words (incredible), clauses (He doesnt have friends). Negation and its correlates (truth values, lying, irony, false or contradictory statements) are exclusive characteristics of humans (Horn, 1989; Horn and Kato, 2000). Negation is fairly well-understood in grammars; the valid ways to express a negation are documented. However, there has not been extensive research on detecting it, and more importantly, on representing the semantics of negation. Negation has been largely ignored within the area of semantic relations. At first glance, one would think that interpreting negation could be reduced to finding negative keywords, detect their scope using syntactic analysis and reverse its polarity. Actually, it is more complex. Negation plays a remarkable role in text understanding and it pose</context>

Neither do they aim at carefully representing the meaning of negated statements nor extracting implicit positive meaning from them. 3 Negation in Natural Language Simply put, negation is a process that turns a statement into its opposite. Unlike affirmative statements, negation is marked by words (e.g., not, no, never) or affixes (e.g., -nt, un-). Negation can interact with other words in special ways. For example, negated clauses use different connective adjuncts that positive clauses do: neither, nor instead of either, or. The so-called negatively-oriented polaritysensitive items (Huddleston and Pullum, 2002) include, among many others, words starting with any(anybody, anyone, anywhere, etc.), the modal auxiliaries dare and need and the grammatical units at all, much and till. Negation in verbs usually requires an auxiliary; if none is present, the auxiliary do is inserted (I read the paper vs. I didnt read the paper). 3.1 Meaning of Negated Statements State-of-the-art semantic role labelers (e.g., the ones trained over PropBank) do not completely represent the meaning of negated statements. Given John didnt build a house to impress Mary, they encode AGENT(John, build), THEME(a house, build), PURP</context>

Some examples could be interpreted differently depending on the context (Section 4.2.1). This paper aims at thoroughly representing the semantics of negation by revealing implicit positive meaning. The main contributions are: (1) interpretation of negation using focus detection; (2) focus of negation annotation over all PropBank negated sentences1; (3) feature set to detect the focus of negation; and (4) model to semantically represent negation and reveal its underlying positive meaning. 3.2 Negation Types Huddleston and Pullum (2002) distinguish four contrasts for negation: Verbal if the marker of negation is grammatically associated with the verb (I did not see anything at all); non-verbal if it is associated with a dependent of the verb (I saw nothing at all). Analytic if the sole function of the negated mark is to mark negation (Bill did not go); synthetic if it has some other function as well ([Nobody]AGENT went to the meeting). 1 Annotation will be available on the authors website Clausal if the negation yields a negative clause (She didnt have a large income); subclausal otherwise (She had a not inconsiderable incom</context>

Note that in (1) the lunch never took place, whereas in (2) a lunch did take place. In this paper, we focus on verbal, analytic, clausal, and both metalinguistic and ordinary negation. 3.3 Scope and Focus Negation has both scope and focus and they are extremely important to capture its semantics. Scope is the part of the meaning that is negated. Focus is that part of the scope that is most prominently or explicitly negated (Huddleston and Pullum, 2002). Both concepts are tightly connected. Scope corresponds to all elements any of whose individual falsity would make the negated statement true. Focus is the element of the scope that is intended to be interpreted as false to make the overall negative true. Consider (1) Cows dont eat meat and its positive counterpart (2) Cows eat meat. The truth conditions of (2) are: (a) somebody eats something; (b) cows are the ones who eat; and (c) meat is what is eaten. In order for (2) to be true, (ac) have to be true. And the falsity of any of them is sufficient to make (1) true. In other words, (1) would</context>

Text understanding is needed and context plays an important role. The most probable focus for (1) is meat, which corresponds to the interpretation cows eat something else than meat. Another possible focus is cows, which yields someone eats meat, but not cows. Both scope and focus are primarily semantic, highly ambiguous and context-dependent. More examples can be found in Tables 1 and 3 and (Huddleston and Pullum, 2002, Chap. 9). 4 Approach to Semantic Representation of Negation Negation does not stand on its own. To be useful, it should be added as part of another existing knowledge representation. In this Section, we outline how to incorporate negation into semantic relations. 4.1 Semantic Relations Semantic relations capture connections between concepts and label them according to their nature. It is out of the scope of this paper to define them in depth, establish a set to consider or discuss their detection. Instead, we use generic semantic roles.

For each example, we provide PropBank annotation (top), the new annotation (i.e., the focus, bottom right) and its interpretation (bottom left). 4.2.2 Interpretation of -NOT The mark -NOT is interpreted as follows: If MNEG-NOT(x, y), then verb y must be negated; the statement does not carry positive meaning. If any other role is marked with -NOT, ROLENOT(x, y) must be interpreted as it is not the case that x is ROLE of y. Unmarked roles are interpreted positive; they correspond to implicit positive meaning. Role labels (A0, MTMP, etc.) maintain the same meaning from PropBank (Palmer et al., 2005). MNEG can be ignored since it is overwritten by -NOT. The new annotation for the example (Figure 1) must be interpreted as: While profitable, it (the company) was not growing and was providing a not satisfactory return on investment. Paraphrasing, While profitable, it was shrinking or idle and was providing an unsatisfactory return on investment. We discover an entailment and an implicature respectively. 4.3 Annotation Process We annotated the 3,993 verbal negations signaled with MNEG in PropBank.

In logic, negation is usually the simplest unary operator and it reverses the truth value. The seminal work by Horn (1989) presents the main thoughts in philosophy and psychology. Linguists have found negation a complex phenomenon; Huddleston and Pullum (2002) dedicate over 60 pages to it. Negation interacts with quantifiers and anaphora (Hintikka, 2002), and influences reasoning (Dowty, 1994; Sanchez Valencia, 1991). Zeijlstra (2007) analyzes the position and form of negative elements and negative concords. Rooth (1985) presented a theory of focus in his dissertation and posterior publications (e.g., Rooth (1992)). In this paper, we follow the insights on scope and focus of negation by Huddleston and Pullum (2002) rather than Rooths (1985). Within natural language processing, negation has drawn attention mainly in sentiment analysis (Wilson et al., 2009; Wiegand et al., 2010) and the biomedical domain.

None of the above references aim at detecting or annotating the focus of negation in natural language. Neither do they aim at carefully representing the meaning of negated statements nor extracting implicit positive meaning from them. 3 Negation in Natural Language Simply put, negation is a process that turns a statement into its opposite. Unlike affirmative statements, negation is marked by words (e.g., not, no, never) or affixes (e.g., -nt, un-). Negation can interact with other words in special ways. For example, negated clauses use differen</context>
