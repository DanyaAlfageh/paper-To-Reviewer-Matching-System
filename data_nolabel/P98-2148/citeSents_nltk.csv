To cope with this problem we 898 \x0cuse the concept of class proposed for a word n-gram model CITATION.,,
The relation between bunsetsu, called dependency, is described by a stochastic context-free grammar CITATION on the classes.,,
Since the relations between bunsetsu known as dependency are not always between sequential ones, we use SCFG to describe them CITATION.,,
To avoid this problem we use the concept of class proposed for a word n-gram model CITATION.,,
Recently some researchers have pointed out the importance of the lexicon and proposed lexicalized models (CITATION; CITATION).,,

The coefficients are estimated by held-out method or deleted interpolation method CITATION.,,
Recently some researchers have pointed out the importance of the lexicon and proposed lexicalized models (CITATION; CITATION).,,
It is reported that the dependency is more frequent between closer bunsetsu in terms of the position in the sentence CITATION.,,
The first model is C. E. Shannon\'s n-gram model CITATION.,,
