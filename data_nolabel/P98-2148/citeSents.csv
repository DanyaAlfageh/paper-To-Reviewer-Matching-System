Recently some researchers have pointed out the importance of the lexicon and proposed lexicalized models (CITATION; CITATION),,
Shannon\'s n-gram model CITATION,,
To avoid this problem we use the concept of class proposed for a word n-gram model CITATION,,
Since the relations between bunsetsu known as dependency are not always between sequential ones, we use SCFG to describe them CITATION,,
The relation between bunsetsu, called dependency, is described by a stochastic context-free grammar CITATION on the classes,,
The coefficients are estimated by held-out method or deleted interpolation method CITATION,,
To cope with this problem we 898 \x0cuse the concept of class proposed for a word n-gram model CITATION,,
It is reported that the dependency is more frequent between closer bunsetsu in terms of the position in the sentence CITATION,,
