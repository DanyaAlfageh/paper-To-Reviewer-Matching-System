This method is not practical because altering the structures of the grammar damages the linguistic information stored in the original grammar CITATION,,
Then there are V q- 1 parameters associated with node r/ 1The best theoretical upper bound on time complexity for the recognition of Tree Adjoining Languages is O(M(n2)), where M(k) is the time needed to multiply two k x k booleanmatrices.CITATION 558 \x0cElem~,,
The Lexicalized Tree-Adjoining Grammar (LTAG) formalism CITATION, CITATION , although not context-free, is the most well-known instance in this category,,

Examples of formalisms using this approach include the work of CITATION, CITATION, CITATION, and CITATION,,

The resulting system is strongly equivalent to CFGs, yet is fully lexicalized and still O(n 3) parsable, as shown by CITATION,,
To train the grammar, we follow the InsideOutside re-estimation algorithm described by CITATION,,
Furthermore, LTIGs can be parameterized to form probabilistic models CITATION,,
The equations calculating the inside and outside probabilities for PLTIGs can be found in CITATION,,
sable, as shown by CITATION,,
This paper presents two sets of experiments, comparing PLTIGs with non-lexicalized Probabilistic Context-Free Grammars (PCFGs) CITATION and non-hierarchical N-gram models that use the right branching bracketing heuristics (period attaches high) as their parsing strategy,,
