As such, we have begun to see some research efforts in mining experience-related attributes such as time, location, topic, and experiencer, and their relations from weblogs (CITATION; CITATION),,
3.3 Results For comparison purposes, we take the method of CITATION as our baseline because the method was used in subsequent studies (CITATION; CITATION) where experience attributes are extracted,,
In order to get meaningful distributions for a manageable number of thematic roles, we used Semlink CITATION that provides a mapping between Framenet and Verbnet and uses a total of 23 thematic roles of Verbnet for the annotated corpora of the two resources,,

While there have been well-known studies about classifying verbs based on aspectual features CITATION, thematic roles and selectional restrictions (CITATION; CITATION; CITATION), valence alternations and intuitions CITATION and conceptual structures CITATION, we found that none of the existing lexical resources such as Framenet CITATION and Verbnet CITATION are sufficient for identifying experience-revealing verbs,,
We utilize two major resources of lexical semantics, Verbnet CITATION based on the theory of CITATION, and Framenet CITATION, which is based on CITATION,,
There have been a number of studies for verb classification (CITATION; CITATION; Somers, 1982; CITATION; CITATION; CITATION) that are essential for construction of an activity verb lexicon, which in turn is important for experience detection,,
First, the candidates that do not have an objective case CITATION are eliminated because their definition of experience as action + object,,
We consider all the verbs and verb phrases in WordNet CITATION which is the largest electronic lexical database,,
While opinion mining or sentiment analysis, which can be considered an important part of experience mining, has been studied quite extensively (see Pang and Lees excellent survey (2008)), another sub-area, factuality analysis, begins to gain some popularity (CITATION; CITATION),,

Based on the theory of CITATION, we classify a given verb or a verb phrase into one of the two categories: activity and state,,
For experience mining, it is important to ensure a sentence mentions an event or passes a factuality test to contain experience CITATION,,
2.1 Background CITATION proposes that verb meanings can be categorized into four basic classes, states, activities, achievements, and accomplishments, depending on interactions between the verbs and their aspectual and temporal modifiers,,
Most similar to our work was done by CITATION, who attempted t,,
CITATION and CITATION introduce linguistic schemata that serve as evidence for the classes,,
We used RBF kernel with the default settings CITATION because it is been known to show moderate performance using multiple feature compositions,,
One of our classifiers is based on Maximum Entropy (ME) models that implement the intuition that the best model will be the one that is consistent with the set of constraints imposed by the evidence, but otherwise is as uniform as possible CITATION,,
For a POS and grammatical check of a candidate sentence, we used the Stanford POS tagger CITATION and Stanford dependency parser CITATION,,
We collected all hyponyms of words do and act, from WordNet CITATION,,
We use POS tagging CITATION for tense determination, but since the Penn tagset provides no future tenses, they are determined by exploiting modal verbs such as will and future expressions such going to,,
itute experiences CITATION or detecting experience-containing parts of text although many NLP research areas such as named entity recognition and verb classification are strongly related,,
The other one is based on Support Vector Machine CITATION which is the state-of-the-art algorithm for many classification tasks,,
We had to alter this step by adopting the approach of CITATION,,
Most similar to our work was done by CITATION, who attempted to categorize verbs into state or event classes based on 14 tests similar to those of Vendlers,,
Subject knowledge has been studied extensively for various functions such as identification, po1 http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Experience_(disambiguation) larity detection, and holder extraction under the names of opinion mining and sentiment analysis CITATION,,
There have been a number of studies for verb classification (CITATION; CITATION; Somers, 1982; CITATION; CITATION; CITATION) that are essential for construction of an activity verb l,,
CITATION demonstrated that syntactic alternations can be the basis for groupings of verbs semantically and accord reasonably well with linguistic intuitions,,
There have been a number of studies for verb classification (CITATION; CITATION; Somers, 1982; CITATION; CITATION; CITATION) that are essential for construction of an activity verb lexicon, which ,,
2.5 Classification For training, we selected 80 seed verbs from Dowtys list (1979) which are representative verbs for each CITATION class,,
Very few studies have focused explicitly on extracting various entities that constitute experiences CITATION or detecting experience-containing parts of text although many NLP research areas such as named entity recognition and verb classification are strongly related,,
