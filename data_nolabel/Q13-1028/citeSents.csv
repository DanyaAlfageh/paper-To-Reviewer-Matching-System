CITATION found that people spontaneously form images of concrete words that they hear and use them to answer questions or perform other tasks,,
2 Article quality corpus Our corpus1 contains chosen articles from the larger New York Times (NYT) corpus CITATION, the latter containing a wealth of metadata about each 1 Available from http://www.cis.upenn.edu/ nlp/corpora/scinewscorpus.html article including author information and manually assigned topic tags,,
3.4 Sub-genres There are several sub-genres within science writing CITATION: short descriptions of discoveries, longer explanatory articles, narratives, stories about scientists, reports on meetings, review articles and blog posts,,
But it is reasonable to expect that properties related to the unique aspects of a genre should contribute to the prediction of quality in the same way that domainspecific spelling and grammar correction (CITATION; CITATION; CITATION) techniques have been successful,,
row, 2008; CITATION) and discourse organization (CITATION; CITATION); b) has a topic that is interesting to a particular user,,
We identified the relations for texts in our corpus using the 349 \x0cAddDiscourse tool CITATION,,
Readability (16 features): We test the full set of readability features studied in CITATION, involving token-type ratio, word and sentence length, language model features, cohesion scores and syntactic estimates of complexity,,
More recently, CITATION found that peoples ratings of interest for fairy tales ,,
The third resource is emotion-related words from FrameNet CITATION,,
345 \x0cThese counts for 664,673 noun phrases were collected by CITATION from the Google Ngram Corpus CITATION,,
Multiple studies in the education genre (CITATION; CITATION) note that when teachers and expert adult readers graded student writing, word choice and phrasing always turn out as a significant factors influencing the raters scores,,
The other class of features are those defined in CITATION for likelihoods and counts of explicit discourse relations,,
More recently, CITATION found that peoples ratings of interest for fairy tales can be successfully predicted using token-level scores related to syntactic items and categories from a psycholinguistic database,,
Narrative texts typically have characters and events CITATION, so we look for entities and past tense in the articles,,
The remaining words are clustered into 100 topics with the Stanford Topic Modeling Toolbox3 CITATION,,
Prior work indicates that three aspects of article quality can be successfully predicted: a) whether a text meets the acceptable standards for spelling CITATION, grammar (CITATION; CITATION) and discourse organization (CITATION; CITATION); b) has a topic that is interesting to a particular user,,
One is the probabilities of different types of entity transitions from the Entity Grid model CITATION which we compute with the Brown Coherence Toolkit CITATION,,
We use Latent Dirichlet Allocation CITATION to cluster image tags into topics,,
We used the CMU pronunciation dictionary CITATION to get the phoneme information for words and built a 4- gram model of phonemes on the background corpus,,
The syntactic relations are obtained using the constituency and dependency parses from the Stanford parser (CITATION; De Marneffe et al., 2006),,
The MPQA CITATION and General Inquirer (Stone et al., 1966) give lists of positive and negative sentiment words,,
Interesting fiction (22 features): are those introduced by CITATION for predicting interest ratings on fairy tales,,
Shorter words CITATION, less complex syntax CITATION and high cohesion between sentences CITATION typically indicate easier and more readable articles,,
More recently, CITATION found that peoples ratings of interest for fairy tales can be successfully predicted using token-level scores related to syntactic it,,
2; CITATION); b) has a topic that is interesting to a particular user,,
\x0czani et al., 1996; CITATION); and c) is easy,,
We use a SVM classifier with a radial basis kernel (R Development Core CITATION) and parameters were tuned using cross validation on the development data,,
Books written for student science journalists (CITATION; CITATION) also emphasize the importance of visual descriptions,,
An early and influential work on readability CITATION also computed an interest measure with the hypothesis that interesting articles would be easier to read,,
This similarity is computed by comparing the topic words (computed using a loglikelihood ratio test CITATION) of the two articles,,
Attribution to other sources is frequent in the news domain since many comments and opinions are not the views of the journalist CITATION,,
Currently, the only resource of imagery ratings for words is the MRC psycholinguistic database CITATION,,
The first is named entity (NE) tags (PERSON, ORGANIZATION and LOCATION) returned by the Stanford NE recognition tool CITATION,,
Shorter words CITATION, l,,
Word features are standard in content-based recommendation systems (CITATION; CITATION) where they are used to pick out articles similar to those which a user has already read,,
\x0czani et al., 1996; CITATION); and c) is easy to read for a target readership,,
