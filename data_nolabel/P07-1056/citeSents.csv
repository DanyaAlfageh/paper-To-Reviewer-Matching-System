CITATION use discourse structure present in congressional records to perform more accurate sentiment classification,,
CITATION show that computing the A-distance for a finite sample is exactly the problem of minimizing the empirical risk of a classifier that discriminates between instances drawn from D and instances drawn from D0,,
We also note the work of CITATION, who performed a number of empirical tests on domain adapt,,
Then, it models the correlations between the pivot features and all other features by training linear pivot predictors to predict occurrences of each pivot in the unlabeled data from both domains (CITATION; CITATION),,
As we noted in Section 5, we are able to significantly outperform basic structural correspondence learning CITATION,,
7 Related Work Sentiment classification has advanced considerably since the work of CITATION, which we use as our baseline,,
CITATION and CITATION suggest = 104, = 0, which we have used in our results so far,,
First, we showed that for a given source and target domain, we can significantly improve for sentiment classification the structural correspondence learning model of CITATION,,
1 Introduction Sentiment detection and classification has received considerable attention recently (CITATION; CITATION; CITATION),,
While we do not have a direct comparison, we note that CITATION performs worse on movie reviews than on his other datasets, the same type of data as the polarity dataset,,
Finally we note that while CITATION did combine SCL with labeled target domain data, they only compared using the label of SCL or non-SCL source classifiers as features, following the work of CITATION,,
We also note the work of CITATION, who performed a number of empirical tests on domain adaptation of sentiment classifiers,,
(2004) and CITATION observe that including the label of a source classifier as a feature on small amounts of target data tends to improve over using either the source alone or the target alone, we did not observe that for our data,,
The work most similar in spirit to ours that of CITATION,,
ation algorithm CITATION for use in sentiment classification,,
Using the notation of CITATION, we can write the supervised training objective of SCL on the source domain as min w,v X i L w0 xi + v0 xi, yi \x01 + ||w||2 + ||v||2 , where y is the label,,
440 \x0crespondence learning (SCL) domain adaptation algorithm CITATION for use in sentiment classification,,
We also note that while CITATION and CITATION observe that including the label of a source classifier as a feature on small amounts of target data tends to improve over using either the source alone or the target alone, we did not observe that for our data,,
CITATION treat sentiment analysis as an ordinal ranking problem,,
In particular, CITATION showed how this technique can be effective for capitalization adaptation,,
This may also be the reason that the model of CITATION did not aid in adaptation,,
Second, we evaluate the A-distance CITATION between domains as measure of the loss due to adaptation from one to the other,,
We augment each labeled target instance xj with the label assigned by the source domain classifier (CITATION; CITATION),,
After this conversion, we had 1000 positive and 1000 negative examples for each domain, the same balanced composition as the polarity dataset CITATION,,
While movie reviews have been the most studied domain, sentiment analysis has extended to a number of new domains, ranging from stock message boards to congressional floor debates (CITATION; CITATION),,
6.2 Unlabeled Adaptability Measurements We follow CITATION and use the Huber loss as a proxy for the A-distance,,
Second, we evaluate the A-distance CITATION between domain,,
