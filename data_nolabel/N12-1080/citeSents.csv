CITATION investigate clustering towards organizing timestamped digita,,
CITATION use the explicit time information in the context of multi-document summarization for sentence extraction and detection of redundant sentences, ordering input documents by time,,
CITATION introduced atomic events, which are named entities connected by a relation such as a verb or action noun,,
Similarity(Si, Sj) = |{wk|wk Si&wk Sj}| log(|Si|) + log(|Sj|) (9) We use TextRank CITATION in our experiments,,
CITATION investigate clustering towards organizing timestamped digital photographs,,
For identification of named entities, we use Stanford NER CITATION,,
1 Introduction Extensive research has gone into determining which features of text documents are useful for calculating the importance of sentences for extractive summarization, as well as how to use these features CITATION,,
We evaluate using ROUGE-2 bigram matching CITATION,,
To identify temporal event boundaries, CITATION calculate novelty scores,,
CITATION identify events as triples consisting of two nodes and a relation,,
3.1 Temporal Information Extraction We use Heideltime, a rule-based system that uses sets of regular expressions, to extract explicit time expressions in the article and normalize them CITATION,,
The approach is naive and is described in CITATION,,
CITATION extract event elements, the arguments in an event, and event terms, the actions,,
WS(Vi) = (1 d) (8) +d X VjIn(Vi) wj,i P vkOut(Vj) wj,k WS(Vj) Like several graph-based methods for sentence ranking for summarization (e.g., CITATION), we use Googles PageRank algorithm (Equation 8) with a damping factor d of 0.85,,
