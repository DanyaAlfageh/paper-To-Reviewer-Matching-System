2 One Sense Per Discourse The observation that words strongly tend to exhibit only one sense in a given discourse or document was stated and quantified in Gale, Church and CITATION,,
CITATION has pioneered work in the hierarchical clust,,
A supervised algorithm based on this property is given in CITATION,,
the proliferation of plant and animal life Including variants of the EM algorithm (Bantu, 1972; CITATION), especially as applied in Gale, Church and Yarowsky CITATION,,
WordNet CITATION is an automatic source for such defining terms,,
(1993), CITATION, and Lehman CITATION), as it does not require costly hand-tagged training sets,,
CITATION has pioneered work in the hierarchical clustering of word senses,,
Although there is some hope from using aligned bilingual corpora as training data for supervised algorithms CITATION, this approach suffers from both the limited availability of such corpora, and the frequent failure of bilingual translation differences to model monolingual sense differences,,
CITATION have proposed a method using co-occurrence statistics in independent monolingual corpora of two languages to guide lexical choice in machine translati,,
The use of dictionary definitions as an optional seed for the unsupervised algorithm stems from a long history of dictionary-based approaches, including CITATION, CITATION, CITATION, and Slator (1991),,
These include Bayesian classifiers CITATION and some implementations of neural nets, but not BrK! rules (Brill, 1993),,
CITATION have proposed a method using co-occurrence statistics in independent monolingual corpora of two languages to guide lexical choice in machine translation,,
The decision-list algorithm used here CITATION identifies other collocations that reliably partition the seed training data, ranked by the purity of the distribution,,
CITATION proposed an early application of bootstrapping to augment training sets for a supervised sense tagger,,
92%.1~ 9 Comparison with Previous Work This algorithm exhibits a fundamental advantage over supervised learning algorithms (including CITATION, CITATION, CITATION, Yarowsky CITATION, Leacock et al,,
Using a decisien list control structure based on CITATION, this algorithm integrates a wide diversity of potential evidence sources (lemmas, inflected forms, parts of speech and arbitrary word classes) in a wide diversity of positional relationships (including local and distant collocations, trigram sequences, and predicate-argument association),,
CITATION), as it does not require costly hand-tagged training sets,,
