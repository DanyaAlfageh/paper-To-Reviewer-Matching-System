This relatively simple approach to translation can be remarkably effective, and, since its introduction, it has been the basis for further innovations, including developing better models for distinguishing the good translations from bad ones (CITATION; CITATION; CITATION; CITATION), improving the identification of phrase pairs in parallel data (CITATION; CITATION), and formal generalizations to gapped rules and rich nonterminal types (CITATION; CITATION).,,

The Russian input should translate (depending on context) as either I saw a cat or I saw the cat; however, the phrase table we learned is only able to generate the former.3 4 Predicting English Definite Articles Although English articles express semantic content, their use is largely predictable in context, both for native English speakers and for automated systems CITATION.4 In this section we describe a classifier that uses local contextual features to predict whether an article belongs in a particular position in a sequence of words, and if so, whether it is definite or indefinite (the form of the indefinite article is deterministic given the pronunciation of the following word).,,
