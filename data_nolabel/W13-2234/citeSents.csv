Definiteness is a semantic property of noun phrases that expresses information such as identifiability, specificity, familiarity and uniqueness CITATION,,
To verify that system improvement is consistent, and is not a result of optimizer instability CITATION, we replicate each experimental setup three times, and then estimate the translation quality of the median MT system using the MultEval toolkit.9 The corpus is the same as in Section 4.3: the training part contains 112,527 sentences from Russian-English TED corpus, randomly sampled 3K sentences are used for tuning and a disjoint set of 2K sentences is used for test,,
 including postediting of MT output CITATION, text generation (CITATION; CITATION), and more recently identification and correction of ESL errors (CITATION; De Felice and Pulman, 2008; CITATION; CITATION),,
Statistical features capture probability of co-occurrences of a sample with each of the determiner classes, e.g., for wi1ywi we collect probabilities of wi1Iwi, wi1Dwi, and wi1Nwi.6 4.3 Training and evaluation We employ the creg regression modeling framework to train a ternary logistic regression classifier.7 All features were computed for the targetside of the Russian-English TED corpus CITATION; from 117,527 sentences we removed 5K sentences used as tuning and test sets in the MT system,,

This relatively simple approach to translation can be remarkably effective, and, since its introduction, it has been the basis for further innovations, including developing better models for distinguishing the good translations from bad ones (CITATION; CITATION; CITATION; CITATION), improving the identification of phrase pairs in parallel data (CITATION; CITATION), and formal generalizations to gapped rules and rich nonterminal types (CITATION; CITATION),,
of MT output CITATION, text generation (CITATION; CITATION), and more recently identification and correction of ESL errors (CITATION; De Felice and Pulman, 2008; CITATION; CITATION),,

To the best of our knowledge, the only studies that directly address generation of synthetic phrase table entries was conducted by CITATION and CITATION,,
For example they may use noncanonical word orders CITATION2 or different constructions such as existentials, differential object marking CITATION, and the ba () construction in Chinese 2 See pp,,
To verify that system improvement is consistent, and is not a result of optimizer instability CITATION, we replicate each experimental setup three times, and then estimate the translation quality of the median MT system using the MultEval toolkit.9 The corpus is the same as in Section 4.3: the training part con,,
We use the Moses toolkit CITATION to train a baseline phrase-based SMT system,,
We extract statistical features from monolingual English corpora released for WMT11 CITATION,,
Improvement in the BLEU score CITATION is statistically significant (p &lt; .05), compared to the baseline system Classifier-generated synthetic phrases We apply classifier with the iterative prediction directly on the baseline phrase table entries and synthesize 944,145 new parallel phrases, increasing the phrase table size by 38%,,
We used part-of-speech (POS) tags produced by the Stanford POS tagger CITATION to capture general article patterns,,
We extract further information indicating whether a named entity, as identified by the Stanford NE Recognizer CITATION begins at wi,,
7 Related Work Automated determiner prediction has been found beneficial in a variety of applications, including postediting of MT output CITATION, text generation (CITATION; CITATION), and more recently identification and correction of ESL errors (CITATION; De Felice and Pulman, 2008; CITATION; CITATION),,
We employ SRILM toolkit CITATION to linearly interpolate the target side of the training corpus with the WMT English corpus, optimizing towards the MT tuning set,,
The Russian input should translate (depending on context) as either I saw a cat or I saw the cat; however, the phrase table we learned is only able to generate the former.3 4 Predicting English Definite Articles Although English articles express semantic content, their use is largely predictable in context, both for native English speakers and for automated systems CITATION.4 In this section we describe a classifier that uses local contextual features to predict whether an article belongs in a particular position in a sequence of words, and if so, whether it is definite or indefinite (the form of the indefinite article is deterministic given the pronunciation of the following word),,
