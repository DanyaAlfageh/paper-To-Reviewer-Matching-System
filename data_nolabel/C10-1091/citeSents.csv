Early attempts to focus on distinct attitude types in the task of attitude analysis were made by CITATION, who determined a potential value of adjectives for affect, judgement and appreciation by calculating the PMI with the pronoun-copular pairs I was (affect), He was (judgement), and It was (appreciation), and CITATION, who used a machine learning technique (SVM) with finegrained semantic distinctions in features (attitude type, orientation) in combination with bag of words to classify movie reviews,,

In this paper we introduce our system @AM (ATtitude Analysis Model), which (1) classifies sentences according to the fine-grained attitude labels (nine affect categories CITATION: anger, disgust, fear, guilt, interest, joy, sadness, shame, surprise; four polarity labels for judgment and appreciation: POS jud, NEG jud, POS app, NEG app; and neutral); (2) assigns the strength of the attitude; and (3) determines the level of confidence, with which the attitude is expressed,,

tude Label The decision on the most appropriate final label for the clause, in case @AM annotates it using different attitude types according to the words with multiple annotations (e.g., see word unfriendly in Table 1) or based on the availability of the words conveying different attitude types, is made based on the analysis of: 1) morphological tags of nominal heads and their premodifiers in the clause (e.g., first person pronoun, third person pronoun, demonstrative pronoun, nominative or genitive noun, etc.); 2) the sequence of hypernymic semantic relations of a particular noun in WordNet CITATION, which allows to determine its conceptual domain (e.g., person, human being, artifact, event, etc.); 3) the annotations from the Stanford Named Entity Recognizer CITATION that labels PERSON, ORGANIZATION, and LOCATION entities,,
