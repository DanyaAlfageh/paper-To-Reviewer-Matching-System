1 Introduction Textual Entailment (TE) CITATION has been proposed as a generic framework for modeling language variability,,
Moreover, we used a set of lexical entailment rules extracted from Wikipedia and WordNet, as described in CITATION,,
In order to obtain a monolingual TE model, we trained and tuned CITATION our model on the RTE3 test set, to reduce the overfitting bias, since 4 http://translate.google.com 5 http://www.statmt.org/moses/ 6 http://www.statmt.org/europarl/ 7 http://www.ldc.upenn.edu 8 http://edits.fbk.eu/ our original data was created over the RTE3 development set,,

The great potential of integrating (monolingual) TE recognition components into NLP architectures has been reported in several works, such as question answering CITATION, information retrieval CITATION, information extraction CITATION, and document summarization CITATION,,
