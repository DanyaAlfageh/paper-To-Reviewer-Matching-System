Work in cross-domain sentiment classification CITATION focuses on the challenge of training a classifier from one or more domains (source domains) and applying the trained classifier in a different domain (target domain),,
We carry out part-of-speech (POS) tagging and lemmatization on each review sentence using the RASP system CITATION,,
The distributional hypothesis CITATION states that words that have similar distributions are semantically similar,,
6 Related Work Compared to single-domain sentiment classification, which has been studied extensively in previous work (CITATION; CITATION), crossdomain sentiment classification has only recently received attention in response to advances in the area of domain adaptation,,
Using a sparse matrix format and approximate similarity matching techniques CITATION, we can efficiently create a thesaurus from a large set of reviews,,
5.2 Effect of Feature Expansion To study the effect of feature expansion at train time compared to test time, we used Amazon reviews for two further domains, music and video, which were also collected by CITATION but are not part of the benchmark dataset,,
We use L1 regularized logistic regression as the classification algorithm CITATION, which produces a sparse model in which most irrelevant features are assigned a zero weight,,
Automatic document level sentiment classification (CITATION; CITATION) is the task of classifying a given review with respect to the sentiment expressed by the author of the review,,
SFA is the spectral feature alignment technique of CITATION,,
In particular, previous work has identified adjectives as good indicators of sentiment (CITATION; CITATION),,

Sentiment classification has been applied in numerous tasks such as opinion mining CITATION, opinion summarization CITATION, contextual advertising CITATION, and market analysis CITATION,,
CITATION use structural feature alignment (SFA) to find an alignment between domain specific and domain independent features,,
