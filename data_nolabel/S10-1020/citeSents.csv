It supports both local (CITATION-style) and global (Integer Linear Programming, CITATION- style) models of coreference,,
Three runs have been submitted for the SemEval task 1 on Coreference Resolution (Recasens et al., 2010), optimizing Corrys performance for BLANC (Recasens and Hovy, in prep), MUC CITATION and CEAF CITATION,,
In our previous studies (CITATION; 2007) we have tested up to 351 nominal/continuous (1096 boolean/continuous) features showing significant improvements over basic feature sets advocated in the literature,,
We deliberately left the B-CUBE score CITATION completely out of our preliminary experiments,,
More details on the classifier itself can be found in CITATION,,
The following constraints suggested in the literature (CITATION; CITATION; CITATION) ensure that these and other coreference properties are respected: 1,,
It supports both local (CITATION-style) and global (ILP, CITATION-style) models of coreference,,
Our local model of coreference is a reimplementation of the algorithm, proposed by CITATION with an extended feature set,,
Corry has only participated in the open setting, as it has already a number of preprocessing modules integrated into the system: the Stanford NLP toolkit for parsing CITATION and NE-tagging CITATION, Wo,,
Corry has only participated in the open setting, as it has already a number of preprocessing modules integrated into the system: the Stanford NLP toolkit for parsing CITATION and NE-tagging CITATION, Wordnet for semantic classes and the U.S,,
2 Preprocessing and Mention Extraction In our previous study CITATION we have shown that up to 35% recall and 20% precision errors in coreference resolution for MUC corpora are due to inaccurate mention detection,,

2 Preprocessing and Mention Extraction In our previous study CITATION we have shown that up to 35% recall and 20% precision errors in coreference resolution for MUC corpora are due to inaccurate m,,
Our global model is largely motivated by CITATION; 2008) and CITATION,,
We have collected a number of runs on the development data to optimize the performance level for a particular score: BLANC (Recasens and Hovy, in prep), MUC CITATION or CEAF CITATION,,
We use the SVM-Light package CITATION for learning our classifiers,,
