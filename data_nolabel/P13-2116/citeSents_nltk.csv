Recent studies have reached a variety of conclusions: in some, joint inference helps extraction quality (CITATION; CITATION; CITATION); and in some, joint inference hurts extraction quality (CITATION; CITATION),,
Most previous approaches use textual or tabular features separately, e.g., tabular approaches that do not use text features (CITATION; CITATION; CITATION) or textual approaches that do not use tabular features (CITATION; CITATION; CITATION),,

Linguistic Features We validate the hypothesis that using linguistic features, e.g., part-of-speech tags CITATION, named-entity tags CITATION, and dependency trees (de Marneffe et al., 2006), helps improve the quality of our approach, called Joint,,
This approach only has access to the text in a document and contains all the features mentioned in CITATION and Mintz et al,,
In both Table and Text, we use a conditional random field CITATION model for the Rock-TotalOrganicCarbon relation,,
Recent studies have reached a variety of conclusions: in some, joint inference helps extraction quality (CITATION; CITATION; CITATION); and in some, joint inference hurts extraction quality (Poon an,,
Recent studies found billions of high-quality relations on the web in HTML CITATION,,
CITATION use bag-of-words features and hyperlinks to recommend new columns for web tables,,
CITATION extract features, including font size and title, from PDF documents in which a table appears to help the table ranking task,,
Extracting information from tables has been discussed by different communities in the last decade, including NLP (CITATION; CITATION; CITATION), artificial intelligence (CITATION; CITATION), information retrieval (CITATION; CITATION), database CITATION, and the web CITATION,,

This approach follows CITATION and CITATION and only uses the tables in a document,,
PDFtoHTML3, and pdf2table CITATION,,
In a prescient study, CITATION proposed to learn the target relation independently from both table and surface textual features, and then combine the result using a linear combination of the predictions,,
We briefly describe some experiments for a dataset that we call Geology CITATION,,
Recent studies have reached a variety of conclusions: in some, joint inference helps extraction quality (CITATION; Poon and D,,
Following CITATION, we combine these two probabilities using a linear combination,,

For example, CITATION mentioned (as future work) that context features could be used to further improve their relation extraction approaches from tables,,
