While early approaches focused on surface-level methods such as wrapper induction CITATION, more recent work in this area includes Bayesian nonparametrics to select the number of rows in the database (CITATIONa),,
The first step is to create a bipartite matching between response and reference entities.3 Using a cost function that quantifies the sim2 Recent work exploiting Wikipedia disambiguation pages for evaluating cross-document coreference suggests an appealing alternative for future work CITATION,,
Some more recent work in record linkage has explicitly formulated the task of inferring a latent relational model of a set of observed datasets (e.g., CITATION; CITATION; CITATION); however, to our knowledge, these prior models have all exploited some predefined database schema (i.e., set of columns), which our model does not require,,
CITATION shows that it is possible to learn a model of name structure, either by using coreference information as labeled data, or by leveraging a small set of hand-crafted constraints,,

We then use Metropolis-Hastings to sample the values of each j, using the joint likelihood, P(j, x(j) |, 2 ) exp((log j )2 ) kj j (j) 22(nj + j) , where x(j) is column j of the inferred table, nj is the number of specified entries in column j of the table x and kj is the number of unique entries in the column; see CITATION for a derivation,,
ere is an extensive literature on probabilistic record linkage, in which database records are compared to determine if they are likely to have the same real-world referents (e.g., CITATION; CITATION),,
In the nonparametric setting, a transition matrix is unbounded along both dimensions, and this can be handled by a hierarchical Dirichlet process (HDP; CITATION).4 We envision other potential applications of the HDP: for example, learning topics of entities which tend to appear together (i.e., given a mention of Mahmoud Abbas in the American press, a mention of Benjamin Netanyahu is likely), and handling documentspecific burstiness (i.e., given that an entity is mentioned once in a document, it is much more likely to be mentioned again),,
